/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. The original code uses a single recursive rule with disjunction (;) to handle both coin success and failure cases, while the generated code splits these into two separate rules for clarity. Both versions correctly model the probabilistic coin flipping scenario and produce identical results. The generated code is slightly more readable due to the separation of cases.
