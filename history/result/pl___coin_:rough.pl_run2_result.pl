/* Result Report:
Validity_form: false
Validity_result: false
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it uses a non-ground probabilistic clause 'coin(_)' which causes an error during execution. The original code properly handles probabilistic grounding by using 'coin(CNT)' within a disjunction, allowing for both success and failure cases to be tracked. The generated code fails to replicate this behavior, leading to a runtime error. Additionally, the generated code lacks the alternative path (the '; \+coin(CNT)' part) present in the original code, which is crucial for the probabilistic counting logic.
