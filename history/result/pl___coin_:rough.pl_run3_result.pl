/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. It introduces a new syntax '->'/2 which is not valid in Problog, leading to an error during execution. The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips, while the generated code incorrectly attempts to use a conditional statement with 'heads(c1)', which is not defined or compatible with the Problog syntax. The generated code also loses the probabilistic nature of the original implementation.
