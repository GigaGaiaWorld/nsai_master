/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but introduces a syntax error in the 'open_door' predicate, causing a parsing failure. The original code correctly implements the problem with distinct cases for opening doors, while the generated version incorrectly combines these cases with a probabilistic choice in a single rule, leading to invalid syntax. The generated code does not produce any results due to this error, whereas the original code correctly shows the expected probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors.
