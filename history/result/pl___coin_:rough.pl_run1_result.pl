/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count the number of successful coin flips out of 4 attempts, each with a 0.8 probability of success. The generated code incorrectly hardcodes the coin flip to always use 'c1' and does not account for multiple independent coin flips, leading to incorrect probabilities. The generated code's results show only two outcomes (4 or 0) with probabilities 0.8 and 0.2, which do not match the original code's distribution of outcomes.
