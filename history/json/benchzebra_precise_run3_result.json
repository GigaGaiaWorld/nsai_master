  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct but has some inconsistencies with the original code. The main issues are in the order of attributes in the house predicates and some misplaced values (e.g., 'snail' instead of 'snails'). Despite these differences, the generated code produces a valid solution that matches the expected result format and logic. The result is consistent with the original code's output, correctly identifying the house with the zebra and other attributes."
