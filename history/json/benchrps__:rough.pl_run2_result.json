  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. It simplifies the result calculation by combining the three conditions into a single play_round predicate, which is more concise. Both codes produce the same result for the given query, correctly identifying player2 as the winner. The generated code maintains all necessary components: move definitions, beats relationships, play/3 predicate, compute_score/2, and determine_winner/3."
