  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but introduces syntax errors and logical inconsistencies. The main issue is in the 'open_door' predicate, which contains an incorrect use of the conditional operator '->' without proper parentheses and structure, leading to a parsing error. The original code correctly models the problem with clear probabilities for opening doors and distinct cases for win conditions. The generated code fails to execute due to these syntax errors, making it invalid. The original code's results show correct probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors (0.3333 and 0.6667 respectively), while the generated code does not produce any results due to its invalidity."
