  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the original code by replacing the disjunction with an if-then-else construct. However, it introduces a syntax error by using '->' without proper parentheses, leading to an 'UnknownClause' error during execution. The original code correctly uses a disjunction to handle both cases of coin flipping, and its results show the expected probabilistic distribution. The generated code fails to execute due to incorrect syntax, making it invalid."
