  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm similar to the original but introduces several issues. The main problem is the incorrect use of the conditional operator '->/2' which is not properly defined in Prolog, leading to a runtime error. Additionally, the bubble/3 predicate in the generated code doesn't correctly accumulate the sorted elements as the original does. The original code successfully sorts the list while the generated code fails to execute due to syntax errors."
