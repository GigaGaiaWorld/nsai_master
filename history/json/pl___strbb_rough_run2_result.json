  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error in the 'between' predicate call. The original code correctly uses 'Max is N-1' before calling 'between(1,Max,I)', while the generated code attempts to directly use 'N-1' in the 'between' call, which is not syntactically correct in Problog. This causes a CallModeError. The logic of both codes is otherwise consistent, but the generated code fails to execute due to this error."
