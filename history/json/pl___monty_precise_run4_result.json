  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to a CallModeError in the Problog engine, which indicates that the arguments for the '<' operator are not ground as required. This error occurs because the variable B in the open_door rule is not properly instantiated before the comparison. The original code correctly handles this by ensuring A and B are properly instantiated before comparison. The generated code fails to meet the requirements and does not produce consistent results with the original code."
