  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It simplifies the 'result' predicate into 'outcome' while maintaining the same logic for determining wins, losses, and draws. The 'play' and 'compute_score' predicates remain unchanged, ensuring the same scoring mechanism. The query and its result are identical to the original, producing the correct winner (player2) with the same moves."
