  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes correctly implement the rock-paper-scissors game rules and result calculation. The main difference lies in the formatting and the naming of the winner ('Player 2' vs 'player2'), which does not affect the logic. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
