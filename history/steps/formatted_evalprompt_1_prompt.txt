</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program consisting of three code blocks that model weather conditions, employment status, and their causal relationships. The purpose is to verify the logical and probabilistic correctness of the implementation and evaluate whether it meets the specified requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The system executed one explicit query with the following result:
- `query(ground_wet)` returned probability 0.2000

All tests passed (no failures) as the single query result matches the expected probabilistic outcome based on the defined rules and facts.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected in the evaluation. The program correctly implements:
1. Weather probabilistic fact (60DAC5DA)
2. Cleaner status fact (63C6AC52)
3. Ground wetness causation rule (A912216E)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning follows correct principles:
1. `P(weather_yesterday(rainy)) = 0.2` directly from fact definition
2. `P(ground_wet) = P(weather_yesterday(rainy))` through the deterministic rule `ground_wet :- weather_yesterday(rainy)`
3. The calculation `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` isn't directly used but is correctly implementable
4. No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
The program meets its functional requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct deterministic rule application
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper handling of probabilistic facts
- **Neural integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used)

Edge cases considered:
1. All ground terms are properly instantiated
2. No recursive rules to evaluate termination
3. No list operations that could fail
4. Probability values remain valid (between 0-1)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

```prolog
% Verified Correct Implementation
0.8::weather_yesterday(sunny); 0.2::weather_yesterday(rainy).
0.9::cleaner_fired.
ground_wet :- weather_yesterday(rainy).
query(ground_wet). % Returns correct 0.2 probability
```

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic logic programming with clear causation modeling. The 20% probability of wet ground properly reflects the 20% chance of rainy weather through the deterministic causation rule. No expansion predicates or neural network integrations were required for this simple case.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
