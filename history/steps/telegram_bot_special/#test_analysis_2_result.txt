# Code Evaluation Report: Relative Location Calculation in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to calculate the relative position of a special zone (danger zone) from a user's location in meters. The calculation converts latitude/longitude degree differences into meter-based offsets using a constant conversion factor.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
- `relative_offset(-211.93753657979838, 289.66279265009524) = 1.0000`
- `user_location(49.875, 8.65639) = 1.0000`

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The results correctly show:
1. The user's fixed location at (49.875, 8.65639)
2. The danger zone is approximately 212 meters south and 290 meters east of the user

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly:
- Retrieves user and zone locations
- Applies the meter conversion factor
- Calculates north/south and east/west offsets

## Root Cause Analysis
In this classical ProbLog scenario:
1. **Logical correctness**: The calculation follows the correct geographic formula:
   ```prolog
   NorthOffset = (ZoneLat - UserLat) * MetersPerDegree
   EastOffset = (ZoneLon - UserLon) * MetersPerDegree
   ```
2. **Termination**: The program is non-recursive and terminates immediately
3. **Probabilistic aspects**: All facts have probability 1.0 (deterministic)
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly computes geographic offsets
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not utilized (all facts deterministic)
3. **Neural network integration**: Not required

Edge cases considered:
- Fixed locations ensure consistent calculations
- The meter conversion factor is properly applied
- No list inputs or recursive operations present

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct for the specified requirements. For production use, additional considerations might include:
- Adding input validation
- Handling dynamic location updates
- Incorporating probabilistic location uncertainty
