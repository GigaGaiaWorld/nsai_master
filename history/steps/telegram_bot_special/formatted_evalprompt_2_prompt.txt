</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Relative Location Calculation in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to calculate the relative position of a special zone (danger zone) from a user's location in meters. The calculation converts latitude/longitude degree differences into meter-based offsets using a constant conversion factor.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
- `relative_offset(-211.93753657979838, 289.66279265009524) = 1.0000`
- `user_location(49.875, 8.65639) = 1.0000`

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The results correctly show:
1. The user's fixed location at (49.875, 8.65639)
2. The danger zone is approximately 212 meters south and 290 meters east of the user

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly:
- Retrieves user and zone locations
- Applies the meter conversion factor
- Calculates north/south and east/west offsets

## Root Cause Analysis
In this classical ProbLog scenario:
1. **Logical correctness**: The calculation follows the correct geographic formula:
   ```prolog
   NorthOffset = (ZoneLat - UserLat) * MetersPerDegree
   EastOffset = (ZoneLon - UserLon) * MetersPerDegree
   ```
2. **Termination**: The program is non-recursive and terminates immediately
3. **Probabilistic aspects**: All facts have probability 1.0 (deterministic)
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly computes geographic offsets
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not utilized (all facts deterministic)
3. **Neural network integration**: Not required

Edge cases considered:
- Fixed locations ensure consistent calculations
- The meter conversion factor is properly applied
- No list inputs or recursive operations present

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct for the specified requirements. For production use, additional considerations might include:
- Adding input validation
- Handling dynamic location updates
- Incorporating probabilistic location uncertainty

**Word count**: 398

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
