### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch doors. The ProbLog implementation provided aims to model this scenario, including the probabilistic selection of doors and the host's behavior.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code results in an error during evaluation:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:234.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The error indicates that the query `open_door/1` is not correctly defined or lacks clauses. No other queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) were evaluated due to this failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically at line 6 (character 234).  
- **Root Cause:** The predicate `open_door/1` is not correctly implemented to handle the two required clauses:  
  1. Randomly selecting between two non-prize, non-selected doors.  
  2. Forcing the selection of the only non-prize, non-selected door.  

The current implementation attempts to use a `findall` and `length` check but fails to define the probabilistic behavior correctly.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not adhere to the probabilistic rules of the Monty Hall problem. The use of `findall` and `length` is not sufficient to model the host's behavior.  
  - The predicate lacks proper probabilistic annotations (`0.5::open_door(D)`) for the case where two doors are available.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The negation `\+ prize(D)` and `\+ (D = Selected)` are correctly used, but the probabilistic distribution is not properly defined.  
  - The implication of the host's choice (`P(A â‡’ B)`) is not modeled.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `member/2` and `select_door/1` predicates are correctly defined.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The `open_door/1` predicate fails to model the host's probabilistic behavior.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where the player's selected door is the only non-prize door.  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are not addressed.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `open_door/1` not correctly defined | Prevents evaluation of all queries | Redefine `open_door/1` to handle probabilistic choices explicitly. |
| 2   | Probabilistic distribution missing | Incorrect host behavior | Add `0.5::open_door(D)` for the two-door case. |
| 3   | Edge cases unhandled | Potential runtime errors | Add guards for invalid inputs and edge cases. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation requires a revision of the `open_door/1` predicate to correctly model the host's behavior and ensure probabilistic correctness.
