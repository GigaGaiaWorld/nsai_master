### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and evaluate the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate. The error message indicates an unmatched character `(` at line 6, column 114. No queries were executed successfully due to this error.

**Failed Queries:**
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed to execute because the model could not be parsed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically in the line:
  ```prolog
  findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(OtherDoor), \+ (OtherDoor = Selected), OtherDoors),
  ```
  The issue is a misplaced parenthesis and incorrect syntax in the `findall/3` call.

- **Line Number:** The error is reported at line 6, column 114.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to implement the two clauses specified in the requirements. However, the syntax error prevents the predicate from being correctly defined.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code includes probabilistic facts (`1/3::prize(1)`, etc.), but the error prevents any probabilistic reasoning from being performed.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Not met due to the syntax error.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the syntax error.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where the input is not a valid door number (e.g., `open_door(4)`).
  - The recursive `member/2` predicate is correctly defined but unused due to the error.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Syntax error in `open_door/1` | Prevents model execution | Fix the `findall/3` call and ensure correct syntax. |
| 2      | Unhandled edge cases in `open_door/1` | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for door numbers. |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features used | N/A | Not applicable for this model. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
The `open_door/1` predicate should be corrected as follows:
```prolog
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(D, [1,2,3]),
    \+ prize(D),
    \+ (D = Selected),
    findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(OtherDoor), \+ (OtherDoor = Selected)), OtherDoors),
    length(OtherDoors, L),
    (L =:= 2 -> 0.5::open_door(D) ; L =:= 1 -> open_door(D)).
```

This ensures the predicate adheres to the requirements and avoids syntax errors.
