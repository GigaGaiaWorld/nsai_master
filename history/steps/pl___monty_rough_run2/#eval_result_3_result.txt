  "ErrorSummary": "The 'open_door/1' predicate is not correctly implemented to handle the probabilistic behavior of the Monty Hall problem. The current implementation fails to define the probabilistic selection between two non-prize doors and does not enforce the selection of the only non-prize door when only one is available.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Redefine 'open_door/1' to explicitly handle the two cases: 1) When there are two non-prize, non-selected doors, use '0.5::open_door(D)' for each door. 2) When there is only one non-prize, non-selected door, enforce its selection. The fix should replace the current implementation with separate clauses for each case, ensuring proper probabilistic annotations and logical conditions.",
