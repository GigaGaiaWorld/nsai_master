<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and evaluate the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate. The error message indicates an unmatched character `(` at line 6, column 114. No queries were executed successfully due to this error.

**Failed Queries:**
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed to execute because the model could not be parsed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically in the line:
  ```prolog
  findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(OtherDoor), \+ (OtherDoor = Selected), OtherDoors),
  ```
  The issue is a misplaced parenthesis and incorrect syntax in the `findall/3` call.

- **Line Number:** The error is reported at line 6, column 114.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to implement the two clauses specified in the requirements. However, the syntax error prevents the predicate from being correctly defined.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code includes probabilistic facts (`1/3::prize(1)`, etc.), but the error prevents any probabilistic reasoning from being performed.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Not met due to the syntax error.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the syntax error.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where the input is not a valid door number (e.g., `open_door(4)`).
  - The recursive `member/2` predicate is correctly defined but unused due to the error.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Syntax error in `open_door/1` | Prevents model execution | Fix the `findall/3` call and ensure correct syntax. |
| 2      | Unhandled edge cases in `open_door/1` | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for door numbers. |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features used | N/A | Not applicable for this model. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
The `open_door/1` predicate should be corrected as follows:
```prolog
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(D, [1,2,3]),
    \+ prize(D),
    \+ (D = Selected),
    findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(OtherDoor), \+ (OtherDoor = Selected)), OtherDoors),
    length(OtherDoors, L),
    (L =:= 2 -> 0.5::open_door(D) ; L =:= 1 -> open_door(D)).
```

This ensures the predicate adheres to the requirements and avoids syntax errors.

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
