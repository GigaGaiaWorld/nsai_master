### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the `open_door/1` predicate, which simulates Monty's behavior of opening a door based on the player's initial choice and the prize's location. The evaluation includes verifying the probabilistic reasoning, logical correctness, and adherence to the problem's requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate an error during execution:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 13:14.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The error suggests that the system could not evaluate the queries due to an undefined clause (`''->'/2`). This likely stems from a syntax or logical error in the `open_door/1` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `open_door/1`  
  - **Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    open_door(D) :-
        select_door(Selected),
        member(D, [1,2,3]),
        \+ prize(D),
        \+ (D = Selected),
        findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(OtherDoor), \+ (OtherDoor = Selected)), OtherDoors),
        length(OtherDoors, L),
        (L =:= 2 -> 0.5::open_door(D) ; L =:= 1 -> open_door(D)).
    ```
  - **Error Location:** Line 13:14 (likely due to the `->` operator or incorrect predicate usage).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate attempts to implement the Monty Hall logic but contains a typo (`OtherDoors` vs. `OtherDoors` in `length/2`).  
  - The use of `->` for conditional probability is incorrect in this context. ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic facts or rules.

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The predicate does not correctly model the uniform probability of Monty choosing between two doors. The `0.5::open_door(D)` is not a valid ProbLog construct.  
  - The negation `\+ prize(D)` is correctly used, but the probabilistic handling is flawed.

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the `open_door/1` predicate is flawed.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to incorrect handling of probabilities.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `select_door(1)` is hardcoded).  
  - Recursive termination is not an issue here, but the logic for Monty's choice is incomplete.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Typo in `length(OtherDoors, L)`  | Prevents correct door selection | Correct the variable name to `OtherDoors`.                                 |
| 2   | Invalid `->` operator usage      | Probabilistic logic fails       | Replace with explicit probabilistic rules (e.g., `0.5::open_door(D)`).     |
| 3   | Incorrect Monty choice logic     | Violates problem requirements   | Rewrite `open_door/1` to uniformly choose between valid doors.             |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires corrections in the `open_door/1` predicate to adhere to the Monty Hall problem's requirements and ProbLog's syntax. The probabilistic reasoning must be explicitly modeled.
