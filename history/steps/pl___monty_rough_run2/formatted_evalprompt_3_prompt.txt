<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch doors. The ProbLog implementation provided aims to model this scenario, including the probabilistic selection of doors and the host's behavior.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code results in an error during evaluation:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:234.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The error indicates that the query `open_door/1` is not correctly defined or lacks clauses. No other queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) were evaluated due to this failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically at line 6 (character 234).  
- **Root Cause:** The predicate `open_door/1` is not correctly implemented to handle the two required clauses:  
  1. Randomly selecting between two non-prize, non-selected doors.  
  2. Forcing the selection of the only non-prize, non-selected door.  

The current implementation attempts to use a `findall` and `length` check but fails to define the probabilistic behavior correctly.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not adhere to the probabilistic rules of the Monty Hall problem. The use of `findall` and `length` is not sufficient to model the host's behavior.  
  - The predicate lacks proper probabilistic annotations (`0.5::open_door(D)`) for the case where two doors are available.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The negation `\+ prize(D)` and `\+ (D = Selected)` are correctly used, but the probabilistic distribution is not properly defined.  
  - The implication of the host's choice (`P(A ⇒ B)`) is not modeled.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `member/2` and `select_door/1` predicates are correctly defined.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The `open_door/1` predicate fails to model the host's probabilistic behavior.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where the player's selected door is the only non-prize door.  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are not addressed.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `open_door/1` not correctly defined | Prevents evaluation of all queries | Redefine `open_door/1` to handle probabilistic choices explicitly. |
| 2   | Probabilistic distribution missing | Incorrect host behavior | Add `0.5::open_door(D)` for the two-door case. |
| 3   | Edge cases unhandled | Potential runtime errors | Add guards for invalid inputs and edge cases. |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation requires a revision of the `open_door/1` predicate to correctly model the host's behavior and ensure probabilistic correctness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
