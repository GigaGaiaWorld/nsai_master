# Code Evaluation Report: Problog Location Calculation

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog program designed to calculate the relative offset between a user's location and a special zone location in meters, taking into account the Earth's curvature. The program should correctly compute the north-south and east-west offsets based on latitude/longitude coordinates.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in an error during model evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
File "/Users/zhenzhili/MASTERTHESIS/#Expert_System_Design/examples/promis/promis_project/problog/problog/tasks/dcproblog/sdd_formula.py", line 39, in get_evaluator
    assert semiring
           ^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs during the Problog model evaluation phase, specifically when trying to initialize the semantic ring for evaluation. This appears to be a system-level error rather than a logic error in the provided code.

The actual queries defined in the code are:
1. `query(relative_offset(NorthOffset, EastOffset))`
2. `query(user_location(North, East))`

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The core logic for calculating relative offsets appears correct:
```prolog
relative_offset(NorthOffset, EastOffset) :-
    user_location(UserLat, UserLon),
    special_zone_location(ZoneLat, ZoneLon),
    meter_per_degree(MetersPerDegree),
    NorthOffset is (ZoneLat - UserLat) * MetersPerDegree,
    EastOffset is (ZoneLon - UserLon) * MetersPerDegree * cos(UserLat * pi / 180).
```

Key observations:
1. The calculation properly accounts for latitude when converting longitude degrees to meters
2. The meter-per-degree constant appears reasonable (111194.93 meters/degree)
3. The trigonometric calculation uses proper unit conversion (degrees to radians)

The error suggests an issue with the Problog environment setup rather than the logic itself.

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (logic appears correct but couldn't be verified due to system error)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements in this code)
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. The code doesn't handle null/undefined inputs
2. No validation for coordinate ranges (-90 to 90 for latitude, -180 to 180 for longitude)
3. No error handling for mathematical operations (e.g., division by zero)

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | System-level evaluation error (semiring assertion) | Prevents code execution | Verify Problog installation and environment setup |
| 2 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add range checks for coordinates |
| 3 | No error handling for calculations | Potential mathematical errors | Add safeguards for trigonometric operations |

**Word Count:** 398

**Recommendations:**
1. First resolve the system-level evaluation error
2. After fixing the environment, verify the actual output of the queries
3. Consider adding input validation and error handling
4. The core calculation logic appears sound based on code inspection
