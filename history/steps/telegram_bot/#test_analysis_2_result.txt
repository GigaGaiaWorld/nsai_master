# Code Evaluation Report: Earth Constant and Relative Offset Calculation

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog program designed to calculate the relative offset between a user's location and a special zone location in meters. The program uses earth constant calculations to convert latitude/longitude differences into meter-based offsets, accounting for latitude's influence on longitude conversion.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show an error during evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
File "/Users/zhenzhili/MASTERTHESIS/#Expert_System_Design/examples/promis/promis_project/problog/problog/tasks/dcproblog/sdd_formula.py", line 39, in get_evaluator
    assert semiring
           ^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs during model evaluation before any queries can be executed. The specific failure is:
- Error Type: AssertionError
- Location: SDD formula evaluation (line 39)
- Root Cause: Missing or undefined semiring structure required for probabilistic evaluation

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The error suggests a fundamental configuration issue:
1. The semiring structure (required for probabilistic computation) is not properly initialized
2. This prevents the evaluation engine from processing any queries
3. The actual logic of the `relative_offset/2` predicate cannot be tested due to this initialization failure

Key observations about the code logic:
- The earth constant calculation appears mathematically correct (111194.93 meters/degree)
- The longitude conversion properly accounts for latitude influence via cosine adjustment
- The relative offset calculation follows standard geospatial conversion formulas

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (logic appears correct but cannot be verified due to initialization error)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not testable due to evaluation failure
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Not Tested:**
- Undefined locations (null values)
- Extreme latitude values (near poles)
- Antipodal locations (180Â° difference)
- Non-numeric inputs

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing semiring structure | Prevents all evaluation | Initialize proper probabilistic context before evaluation |
| 2 | Untested edge cases | Potential runtime errors | Add test cases for boundary conditions |
| 3 | Unverified location handling | Possible incorrect calculations | Implement input validation |

**Recommendations:**
1. Fix the semiring initialization issue
2. Add test cases for:
   ```prolog
   % Edge case tests
   query(relative_offset(_,_)). % Current location
   query(relative_offset(_,_)). % 1 degree north
   query(relative_offset(_,_)). % 1 degree east
   ```
3. Consider adding input validation:
   ```prolog
   valid_coordinate(Lat, Lon) :-
       number(Lat), number(Lon),
       Lat >= -90, Lat =< 90,
       Lon >= -180, Lon =< 180.
   ```

The core logic appears sound, but the evaluation environment needs proper configuration before the implementation can be properly verified. The geospatial calculations follow standard formulas and should work correctly once the initialization issue is resolved.
