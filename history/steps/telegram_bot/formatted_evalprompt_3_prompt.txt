</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Problog Location Calculation

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog program designed to calculate the relative offset between a user's location and a special zone location in meters, taking into account the Earth's curvature. The program should correctly compute the north-south and east-west offsets based on latitude/longitude coordinates.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in an error during model evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
File "/Users/zhenzhili/MASTERTHESIS/#Expert_System_Design/examples/promis/promis_project/problog/problog/tasks/dcproblog/sdd_formula.py", line 39, in get_evaluator
    assert semiring
           ^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs during the Problog model evaluation phase, specifically when trying to initialize the semantic ring for evaluation. This appears to be a system-level error rather than a logic error in the provided code.

The actual queries defined in the code are:
1. `query(relative_offset(NorthOffset, EastOffset))`
2. `query(user_location(North, East))`

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The core logic for calculating relative offsets appears correct:
```prolog
relative_offset(NorthOffset, EastOffset) :-
    user_location(UserLat, UserLon),
    special_zone_location(ZoneLat, ZoneLon),
    meter_per_degree(MetersPerDegree),
    NorthOffset is (ZoneLat - UserLat) * MetersPerDegree,
    EastOffset is (ZoneLon - UserLon) * MetersPerDegree * cos(UserLat * pi / 180).
```

Key observations:
1. The calculation properly accounts for latitude when converting longitude degrees to meters
2. The meter-per-degree constant appears reasonable (111194.93 meters/degree)
3. The trigonometric calculation uses proper unit conversion (degrees to radians)

The error suggests an issue with the Problog environment setup rather than the logic itself.

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (logic appears correct but couldn't be verified due to system error)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements in this code)
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. The code doesn't handle null/undefined inputs
2. No validation for coordinate ranges (-90 to 90 for latitude, -180 to 180 for longitude)
3. No error handling for mathematical operations (e.g., division by zero)

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | System-level evaluation error (semiring assertion) | Prevents code execution | Verify Problog installation and environment setup |
| 2 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add range checks for coordinates |
| 3 | No error handling for calculations | Potential mathematical errors | Add safeguards for trigonometric operations |

**Word Count:** 398

**Recommendations:**
1. First resolve the system-level evaluation error
2. After fixing the environment, verify the actual output of the queries
3. Consider adding input validation and error handling
4. The core calculation logic appears sound based on code inspection

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
