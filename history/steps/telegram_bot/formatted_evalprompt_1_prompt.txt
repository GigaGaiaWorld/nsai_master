</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Geographical Coordinates and Relative Offset Calculation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog program that calculates the relative offset between a user's location and a special zone location using geographical coordinates. The purpose is to verify the correctness of coordinate handling and distance calculations in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show two queries with their return values:
1. `user_location(49.875,8.65639) = 1.0000`
2. `relative_offset(249.9662026401759,0.0) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match exactly with the expected values:
- The user location is correctly instantiated with the specified coordinates
- The relative offset calculation produces the correct northward displacement (249.97m) with no eastward displacement

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates are correctly defined:
- `user_location/2` (line 1) is properly instantiated
- `special_zone_location/2` (line 2) is correctly offset from the user location
- `relative_offset/2` (lines 3-4) correctly implements the haversine distance calculation

## Root Cause Analysis
The code demonstrates correct classical Problog functionality:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The distance calculation properly accounts for:
   - Earth's curvature (111194.93 meters/degree constant)
   - Latitude adjustment for east-west distances (cosine term)
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: All facts have probability 1.0, making this effectively deterministic
3. **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation (no neural network integration)

The calculation follows geographical conventions:
```prolog
NorthOffset is (ZoneLat - UserLat) * 111194.93, % Correct north-south calculation
EastOffset is (ZoneLon - UserLon) * 111194.93 * cos(UserLat * pi / 180). % Correct east-west with latitude adjustment
```

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
- **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly calculates geographical offsets
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Properly handles deterministic facts (though not probabilistic in this case)
- **Edge Cases**: The code would benefit from handling:
  - Coordinate validation (latitude between -90/90, longitude between -180/180)
  - Null or invalid inputs
  - Very small distances where floating-point precision might matter

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Add input validation for coordinates |
| 2 | None | None | Consider adding probabilistic variations |
| 3 | None | None | Add edge case handling for polar regions |

The implementation is correct for the given requirements, with potential improvements for robustness in production environments. The word count of this report is approximately 350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
