# Code Evaluation Report: Geographical Coordinates and Relative Offset Calculation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog program that calculates the relative offset between a user's location and a special zone location using geographical coordinates. The purpose is to verify the correctness of coordinate handling and distance calculations in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show two queries with their return values:
1. `user_location(49.875,8.65639) = 1.0000`
2. `relative_offset(249.9662026401759,0.0) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match exactly with the expected values:
- The user location is correctly instantiated with the specified coordinates
- The relative offset calculation produces the correct northward displacement (249.97m) with no eastward displacement

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates are correctly defined:
- `user_location/2` (line 1) is properly instantiated
- `special_zone_location/2` (line 2) is correctly offset from the user location
- `relative_offset/2` (lines 3-4) correctly implements the haversine distance calculation

## Root Cause Analysis
The code demonstrates correct classical Problog functionality:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The distance calculation properly accounts for:
   - Earth's curvature (111194.93 meters/degree constant)
   - Latitude adjustment for east-west distances (cosine term)
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: All facts have probability 1.0, making this effectively deterministic
3. **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation (no neural network integration)

The calculation follows geographical conventions:
```prolog
NorthOffset is (ZoneLat - UserLat) * 111194.93, % Correct north-south calculation
EastOffset is (ZoneLon - UserLon) * 111194.93 * cos(UserLat * pi / 180). % Correct east-west with latitude adjustment
```

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
- **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly calculates geographical offsets
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Properly handles deterministic facts (though not probabilistic in this case)
- **Edge Cases**: The code would benefit from handling:
  - Coordinate validation (latitude between -90/90, longitude between -180/180)
  - Null or invalid inputs
  - Very small distances where floating-point precision might matter

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Add input validation for coordinates |
| 2 | None | None | Consider adding probabilistic variations |
| 3 | None | None | Add edge case handling for polar regions |

The implementation is correct for the given requirements, with potential improvements for robustness in production environments. The word count of this report is approximately 350 words.
