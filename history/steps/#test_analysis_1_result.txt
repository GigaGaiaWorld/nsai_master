# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program consisting of three code blocks that model weather conditions, employment status, and their causal relationships. The purpose is to verify the logical and probabilistic correctness of the implementation and evaluate whether it meets the specified requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The system executed one explicit query with the following result:
- `query(ground_wet)` returned probability 0.2000

All tests passed (no failures) as the single query result matches the expected probabilistic outcome based on the defined rules and facts.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected in the evaluation. The program correctly implements:
1. Weather probabilistic fact (60DAC5DA)
2. Cleaner status fact (63C6AC52)
3. Ground wetness causation rule (A912216E)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning follows correct principles:
1. `P(weather_yesterday(rainy)) = 0.2` directly from fact definition
2. `P(ground_wet) = P(weather_yesterday(rainy))` through the deterministic rule `ground_wet :- weather_yesterday(rainy)`
3. The calculation `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` isn't directly used but is correctly implementable
4. No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
The program meets its functional requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct deterministic rule application
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper handling of probabilistic facts
- **Neural integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used)

Edge cases considered:
1. All ground terms are properly instantiated
2. No recursive rules to evaluate termination
3. No list operations that could fail
4. Probability values remain valid (between 0-1)

## Error Summary

```prolog
% Verified Correct Implementation
0.8::weather_yesterday(sunny); 0.2::weather_yesterday(rainy).
0.9::cleaner_fired.
ground_wet :- weather_yesterday(rainy).
query(ground_wet). % Returns correct 0.2 probability
```

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic logic programming with clear causation modeling. The 20% probability of wet ground properly reflects the 20% chance of rainy weather through the deterministic causation rule. No expansion predicates or neural network integrations were required for this simple case.
