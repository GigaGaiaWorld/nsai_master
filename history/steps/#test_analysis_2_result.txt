# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program that models the probability of a wet ground based on weather conditions and cleaning activities. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and identify any potential issues in the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test executed a single query:
- `query(ground_wet).` with result `ground_wet = 0.6000`

All tests passed (no failures) as the computed probability matches the expected logical outcome based on the given rules and probabilities.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The program correctly implements:
1. Weather probability facts (line 1)
2. Cleaner employment status (line 3)
3. Floor mopping probability (line 6)
4. Ground wetness rules (lines 7-8)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probability calculation is correct according to probabilistic rules:
1. P(ground_wet) = P(weather_yesterday(rainy)) + P(mop_floor(true)) - P(weather_yesterday(rainy) âˆ§ mop_floor(true))
2. Using given values: 0.2 + 0.5 - (0.2*0.5) = 0.6

The program properly handles:
- Probabilistic facts declaration
- Logical disjunction through multiple ground_wet rules
- Independent probability combination

DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration present).

## Overall Analysis
The program successfully meets its functional requirements for probabilistic reasoning about ground wetness. The implementation correctly combines probabilities from different independent causes (weather and mopping).

Edge cases considered:
1. All probabilities are properly defined (no undefined cases)
2. Inputs are binary (true/false) with clear probabilities
3. No recursive rules that could cause performance issues
4. Probability values are properly normalized (sum to 1 for each fact)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and handles the specified requirements properly. The probability calculation follows standard probabilistic rules and produces the expected result. No modifications are needed for the current requirements.
