<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# UAV Mission Validation System Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program designed to validate UAV mission feasibility based on battery charge, weather conditions, weight, and location restrictions. The system evaluates whether a UAV can safely operate in given conditions while complying with regulatory constraints.

## Test Results Summary
All tests passed (no failures). The program demonstrates correct behavior in:
- Battery efficiency calculations based on temperature ranges
- Visual line of sight determination under various weather conditions
- Return-to-operator capability considering wind speed
- Sensitive area detection
- Permit validation for different location types

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates demonstrate correct logical behavior:
- `battery_efficiency/1` (Lines 8-14) correctly handles all temperature ranges
- `vlos/1` (Lines 16-22) properly implements visual line of sight rules
- `can_return/1` (Lines 24-28) accurately calculates return capability
- `sensitive_section/1` (Lines 30-36) correctly implements no-fly zone logic
- `permits/1` (Lines 38-40) validates location permissions appropriately

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct probabilistic and logical behavior:
1. **Probabilistic Facts**: 
   - Initial charge and weight distributions follow normal distributions (Lines 2-4)
   - All probability calculations maintain P(¬A)=1−P(A) consistency

2. **Logical Rules**:
   - All predicates terminate properly with no infinite recursion
   - Rule conditions are mutually exclusive where required (temperature ranges)
   - No undefined predicates or circular dependencies exist

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**: 
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration present)

## Overall Analysis
The program meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: 
   - Correctly implements all regulatory and physical constraints
   - Handles edge cases (e.g., no sensitive zones, extreme temperatures)

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: 
   - Properly models uncertain parameters (charge, weight)
   - Maintains probabilistic consistency

3. **Edge Cases Handled**:
   - Negative temperatures (battery efficiency)
   - Zero-distance edge case for sensitive zones
   - All weather condition combinations

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The program demonstrates robust implementation with no identified errors. For future enhancement, consider adding neural network integration (DeepProbLog) for more sophisticated weather pattern recognition or battery performance prediction.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
