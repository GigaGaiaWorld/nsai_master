<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# UAV Mission Validation System Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program designed to validate UAV missions based on battery efficiency, visual line of sight, and regulatory permits. The system incorporates real-time weather conditions and probabilistic factors to determine mission feasibility.

## Test Results Summary
```prolog
% Test queries and results:
?- battery_efficiency(E). 
% Returns E = 1.0 (with 100% probability) based on current weather(_,_,28)

?- vlos(X).
% Returns false (no specific location X provided with distance facts)

?- can_return(X).
% Returns false (depends on undefined distance/2 predicate)

?- landscape(X).
% Returns false (depends on multiple undefined predicates)
```

All tests passed (no failures) in terms of syntax and basic logical structure, but several predicates cannot execute fully due to missing supporting facts.

## Failure Localization
No outright failures exist in the code logic, but several dependencies prevent complete execution:

1. Missing distance/2 facts (lines 15-28)
2. Missing over/2 facts (lines 25, 28)
3. Undefined location-specific predicates (special_zone, service, etc.)

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct probabilistic handling:
- Battery efficiency properly follows conditional probability rules
- Charge calculations correctly incorporate weather factors
- Weight distribution uses normal distribution appropriately

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The program partially meets requirements:
- ✅ Classical reasoning: Correct but incomplete due to missing facts
- ✅ Probabilistic reasoning: Properly implemented for available components
- ❌ Neural network integration: Not utilized

Edge cases to consider:
1. Undefined weather conditions in battery_efficiency/1
2. Missing distance calculations for vlos/1
3. No handling for extreme temperature values (>50°C or <-20°C)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing distance facts | Partial execution | Add location-specific distance predicates |
| 2 | Undefined zone types | Permits check fails | Define all zone types from requirements |
| 3 | No weather fallback | Possible null cases | Add default weather handling |
| 4 | No extreme temp handling | Possible edge cases | Extend battery_efficiency rules |

The code demonstrates sound probabilistic reasoning foundations but requires additional supporting facts and edge case handling to become fully operational. The core logic appears correct, with all probability calculations following standard rules (P(¬A)=1−P(A), proper conditional branching). The next development steps should focus on completing the fact base and adding robustness checks.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
