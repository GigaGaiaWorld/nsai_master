 According to the police: use the same coordinate as user, what should we do about the zone? You need to use special_zone to refer to the zone, for example: distance(X, special_zone) < 100. 
 If 'nothing happens' set the range to 0, for example distance(X, special_zone) < 0. 
 If it is clearly stated that flying is prohibited outside the area, use for example distance(X, special_zone) > 100 </Requirements></Langda>

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
