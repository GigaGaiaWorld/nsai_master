### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, ...]`). The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `detect_all/2` to map images to their corresponding symbols and then evaluates the expression. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the `parse/2` predicate, which handles arithmetic operations while considering the `almost_equal/2` predicate for floating-point comparisons.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query:**  
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
```

**Analysis:**  
The test result shows a probability of `0.0000`, indicating a failure. The expected result should be a valid arithmetic evaluation of the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`. The failure suggests that the `parse/2` predicate is not correctly handling the arithmetic operations.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Query:**  
The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` failed to produce the correct result.

**Problematic Predicate:**  
The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It only handles single-number inputs (`parse([N], R)`) but does not define rules for arithmetic operations (e.g., `parse([N1, O, N2 | T], R)`).

**Code Line:**  
The issue lies in the missing rules for `parse/2` to handle arithmetic operations.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Logical Correctness:**  
- The `parse/2` predicate lacks rules for arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
- The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly defined for floating-point comparisons but is not utilized in the missing arithmetic rules.

**Recursive Termination:**  
- The current implementation does not recursively parse the list of symbols, leading to incomplete evaluation.

**Probabilistic Context:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code correctly maps images to symbols but fails to evaluate arithmetic expressions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Non-list inputs are not handled.  
- Deep recursion is not a concern due to the lack of recursive parsing.  
- The `parse/2` predicate is undefined for arithmetic operations.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Missing `parse/2` rules for arithmetic operations | Expression evaluation fails | Define `parse/2` rules for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `parse([N1, '/', N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 / N2, parse(T, R).`) |
| 2      | Incomplete test coverage | Unverified edge cases | Add tests for edge cases (e.g., empty list, invalid symbols) |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features used | Limited functionality | Consider integrating neural network predicates if needed |

**Word Count:** ~450 words

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails to meet the functional requirement of evaluating arithmetic expressions due to missing `parse/2` rules. Addressing this issue and expanding test coverage will ensure correctness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in the current implementation.
