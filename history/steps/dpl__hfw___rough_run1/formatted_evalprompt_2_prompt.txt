</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, ...]`). The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `detect_all/2` to map images to their corresponding symbols and then evaluates the expression. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the `parse/2` predicate, which handles arithmetic operations while considering the `almost_equal/2` predicate for floating-point comparisons.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query:**  
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
```

**Analysis:**  
The test result shows a probability of `0.0000`, indicating a failure. The expected result should be a valid arithmetic evaluation of the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`. The failure suggests that the `parse/2` predicate is not correctly handling the arithmetic operations.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Query:**  
The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` failed to produce the correct result.

**Problematic Predicate:**  
The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It only handles single-number inputs (`parse([N], R)`) but does not define rules for arithmetic operations (e.g., `parse([N1, O, N2 | T], R)`).

**Code Line:**  
The issue lies in the missing rules for `parse/2` to handle arithmetic operations.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Logical Correctness:**  
- The `parse/2` predicate lacks rules for arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
- The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly defined for floating-point comparisons but is not utilized in the missing arithmetic rules.

**Recursive Termination:**  
- The current implementation does not recursively parse the list of symbols, leading to incomplete evaluation.

**Probabilistic Context:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code correctly maps images to symbols but fails to evaluate arithmetic expressions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Non-list inputs are not handled.  
- Deep recursion is not a concern due to the lack of recursive parsing.  
- The `parse/2` predicate is undefined for arithmetic operations.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Missing `parse/2` rules for arithmetic operations | Expression evaluation fails | Define `parse/2` rules for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `parse([N1, '/', N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 / N2, parse(T, R).`) |
| 2      | Incomplete test coverage | Unverified edge cases | Add tests for edge cases (e.g., empty list, invalid symbols) |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features used | Limited functionality | Consider integrating neural network predicates if needed |

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

---

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails to meet the functional requirement of evaluating arithmetic expressions due to missing `parse/2` rules. Addressing this issue and expanding test coverage will ensure correctness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in the current implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
