</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse a list of symbols representing numbers and arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and compute the result of the expression. The code includes predicates for detecting numbers and operators, parsing the list, and evaluating the expression. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of such failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
```
**Analysis:**  
The test failed because the result `X2` was computed as `0.0000`, which is incorrect for the given expression. The expected result should be the evaluation of the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Query:**  
```prolog
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X).
```
**Actual Result:** `0.0000`  
**Expected Result:** The correct evaluation of the arithmetic expression.  

**Root Cause:**  
The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It only handles the case of a single number (`parse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R).`) and does not account for arithmetic operations in the list. The predicate should be expanded to handle operations recursively.

**Code Line:**  
The issue lies in the definition of `parse/2` (line 20-21 in the provided code).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
- The `parse/2` predicate lacks rules to handle arithmetic operations. It only matches a single number, leading to incorrect results for expressions with operations.
- The recursive termination condition is correct for single numbers but fails for longer lists.

**Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.
- The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly defined for handling floating-point comparisons.

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
**Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code correctly detects numbers and operators but fails to parse and evaluate expressions.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code does not handle non-list inputs or undefined operations.
- Deep recursion performance is not tested, but the current implementation lacks recursive rules for operations.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Incomplete `parse/2` predicate | Incorrect evaluation of expressions | Add rules to handle arithmetic operations recursively. |
| 2      | No handling of edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs) | Potential runtime errors | Validate input format and handle edge cases. |
| 3      | DeepProbLog features not used | Limited functionality | Consider integrating neural network predicates if needed. |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails to meet the functional requirement of parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions due to an incomplete `parse/2` predicate. The issue can be resolved by expanding the predicate to handle operations recursively. Edge cases and input validation should also be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
