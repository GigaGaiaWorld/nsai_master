  "ErrorSummary": "Incomplete parse/2 predicate; lacks rules to handle arithmetic operations in the list, leading to incorrect evaluation of expressions.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Expand the parse/2 predicate to recursively handle arithmetic operations. For example:\nparse([N, Op, M | T], R) :- \n  almost_equal(N, N2), \n  almost_equal(M, M2), \n  (Op = '+' -> R2 is N2 + M2; \n   Op = '-' -> R2 is N2 - M2; \n   Op = '*' -> R2 is N2 * M2; \n   Op = '/' -> R2 is N2 / M2), \n  parse([R2 | T], R).\nparse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R).",
