  "ErrorSummary": "The 'open_door/1' predicate is malformed, causing an 'UnknownClause' error during evaluation. The predicate fails to handle cases correctly due to syntax/logical issues.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Rewrite the 'open_door/1' predicate to explicitly handle the two cases: (1) Randomly select between two valid doors, and (2) Select the only valid door. Ensure proper syntax and logical flow. Example fix:\n\nopen_door(D) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    findall(X, (member(X, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), \+ X = Selected), Doors),\n    (Doors = [A, B] -> random_member(D, [A, B]);\n    Doors = [A] -> D = A).",
