<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the `open_door/1` predicate, which simulates Monty's action of opening a door based on the player's choice and the prize location. The evaluation includes verifying the probabilistic reasoning, logical correctness, and adherence to the problem's requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an unknown clause for `''->'/2'` at line 6:133. This suggests a syntax or predicate definition issue in the code. No queries were successfully executed due to this error.

**Failed Queries:**  
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed to execute due to the error.

**Expected Results:**  
- The queries should return probabilities for the prize location, player's choice, and the outcomes of keeping or switching doors.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically at the line where the `findall/3` and `random_member/2` predicates are used. The issue is likely due to an undefined or incorrectly used predicate (`''->'/2'`).

**Code Block with Error:**  
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    findall(X, (member(X, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), \+ select_door(X)), Doors),
    length(Doors, Len),
    (Len =:= 2 ->
        random_member(Door, Doors)
    ; Len =:= 1 ->
        member(Door, Doors)
    ).
```

**Line Number Interval:**  
Lines 6–10.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Logical Correctness:**  
- The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to select a door based on the conditions provided. However, the error suggests a syntax issue, possibly due to misplaced parentheses or an undefined predicate (`random_member/2`).

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
- The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined with uniform probabilities. However, the negation (`\+`) and implication logic in `open_door/1` must comply with probabilistic rules. The current implementation does not execute due to the syntax error.

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (failed due to syntax error).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not verified (failed before execution).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where `Doors` is empty (though this should not occur in the Monty Hall problem).  
- The `random_member/2` predicate is not standard in ProbLog and may need replacement with a compatible alternative.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Unknown clause `''->'/2'` | Prevents execution of all queries | Fix syntax in `open_door/1` and ensure all predicates are defined. |
| 2      | Undefined `random_member/2` | Causes runtime error | Replace with a ProbLog-compatible random selection method. |
| 3      | Missing edge case handling | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for empty `Doors` list. |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate. Correcting this and ensuring all predicates are defined will allow the queries to execute and verify the probabilistic reasoning. The overall structure aligns with the Monty Hall problem requirements, but the implementation needs refinement.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
