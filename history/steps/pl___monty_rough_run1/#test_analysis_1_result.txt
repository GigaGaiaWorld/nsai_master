### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, ensuring that the probabilistic reasoning aligns with the problem's requirements. The evaluation focuses on:  
- Correctness of the `open_door/1` predicate.  
- Accuracy of the probabilistic queries (`win_keep`, `win_switch`).  
- Compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the theoretical values (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Uniform Random Selection:** When two doors are available, `open_door/1` selects one uniformly (0.5 probability).  
2. **Deterministic Selection:** When only one door is available, it is opened deterministically.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list traversal.  
- The `open_door/1` predicate handles both cases (two doors and one door) as required.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The negation (`\+`) and probabilistic facts (`1/3::prize/1`) comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
- The `findall/3` and `length/2` predicates ensure the correct number of doors are considered.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Correctly implemented (e.g., `member/2`, `findall/3`).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Accurately models the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `select_door/1` is always called with a valid door).  
- Recursion in `member/2` is well-defined and terminates.
