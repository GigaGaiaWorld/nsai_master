</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the `open_door/1` predicate and the associated probabilistic reasoning. The evaluation includes verifying test results, identifying failures, and analyzing root causes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate an error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:138.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The error occurs during the evaluation of the `open_door/1` predicate. No queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) were executed successfully due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** The error is traced to line 6, column 138, where the `open_door/1` predicate is defined.  
- **Root Cause:** The predicate `open_door/1` is not correctly implemented or is missing required clauses. The error suggests a syntax or logical issue in the predicate definition.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to handle two cases:  
    1. Randomly selecting a door when two options are available.  
    2. Selecting the only available door when one option exists.  
  - The current implementation uses `findall`, `length`, and `random_member`, but the error suggests a malformed clause or missing predicate.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined with uniform probabilities.  
  - The negation (`\+`) and implication logic in `win_switch` and `open_door/1` must comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `open_door/1` predicate fails, affecting the overall logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for `prize/1` and `select_door/1`.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate may fail for edge cases like empty lists or invalid inputs.  
  - Recursive termination in `member/2` is correct.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `open_door/1` predicate malformed | Prevents execution of all queries | Correct the predicate definition and ensure all cases are handled. |
| 2   | Syntax error in `open_door/1` | Halts evaluation | Verify the syntax and logical flow of the predicate. |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features used | N/A | Report as "DeepProbLog feature not used". |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The primary issue lies in the `open_door/1` predicate. Correcting this will likely resolve the evaluation error and allow the queries to execute as intended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
