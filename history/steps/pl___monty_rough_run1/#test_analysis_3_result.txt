### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the `open_door/1` predicate, which simulates Monty's action of opening a door based on the player's choice and the prize location. The evaluation includes verifying the probabilistic reasoning, logical correctness, and adherence to the problem's requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an unknown clause for `''->'/2'` at line 6:133. This suggests a syntax or predicate definition issue in the code. No queries were successfully executed due to this error.

**Failed Queries:**  
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed to execute due to the error.

**Expected Results:**  
- The queries should return probabilities for the prize location, player's choice, and the outcomes of keeping or switching doors.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically at the line where the `findall/3` and `random_member/2` predicates are used. The issue is likely due to an undefined or incorrectly used predicate (`''->'/2'`).

**Code Block with Error:**  
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    findall(X, (member(X, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), \+ select_door(X)), Doors),
    length(Doors, Len),
    (Len =:= 2 ->
        random_member(Door, Doors)
    ; Len =:= 1 ->
        member(Door, Doors)
    ).
```

**Line Number Interval:**  
Lines 6–10.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Logical Correctness:**  
- The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to select a door based on the conditions provided. However, the error suggests a syntax issue, possibly due to misplaced parentheses or an undefined predicate (`random_member/2`).

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
- The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined with uniform probabilities. However, the negation (`\+`) and implication logic in `open_door/1` must comply with probabilistic rules. The current implementation does not execute due to the syntax error.

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (failed due to syntax error).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not verified (failed before execution).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where `Doors` is empty (though this should not occur in the Monty Hall problem).  
- The `random_member/2` predicate is not standard in ProbLog and may need replacement with a compatible alternative.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Unknown clause `''->'/2'` | Prevents execution of all queries | Fix syntax in `open_door/1` and ensure all predicates are defined. |
| 2      | Undefined `random_member/2` | Causes runtime error | Replace with a ProbLog-compatible random selection method. |
| 3      | Missing edge case handling | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for empty `Doors` list. |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate. Correcting this and ensuring all predicates are defined will allow the queries to execute and verify the probabilistic reasoning. The overall structure aligns with the Monty Hall problem requirements, but the implementation needs refinement.
