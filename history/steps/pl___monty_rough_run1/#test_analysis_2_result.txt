### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the `open_door/1` predicate and the associated probabilistic reasoning. The evaluation includes verifying test results, identifying failures, and analyzing root causes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate an error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:138.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The error occurs during the evaluation of the `open_door/1` predicate. No queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) were executed successfully due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** The error is traced to line 6, column 138, where the `open_door/1` predicate is defined.  
- **Root Cause:** The predicate `open_door/1` is not correctly implemented or is missing required clauses. The error suggests a syntax or logical issue in the predicate definition.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to handle two cases:  
    1. Randomly selecting a door when two options are available.  
    2. Selecting the only available door when one option exists.  
  - The current implementation uses `findall`, `length`, and `random_member`, but the error suggests a malformed clause or missing predicate.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined with uniform probabilities.  
  - The negation (`\+`) and implication logic in `win_switch` and `open_door/1` must comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `open_door/1` predicate fails, affecting the overall logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for `prize/1` and `select_door/1`.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate may fail for edge cases like empty lists or invalid inputs.  
  - Recursive termination in `member/2` is correct.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `open_door/1` predicate malformed | Prevents execution of all queries | Correct the predicate definition and ensure all cases are handled. |
| 2   | Syntax error in `open_door/1` | Halts evaluation | Verify the syntax and logical flow of the predicate. |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features used | N/A | Report as "DeepProbLog feature not used". |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The primary issue lies in the `open_door/1` predicate. Correcting this will likely resolve the evaluation error and allow the queries to execute as intended.
