<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arabic Digit Summation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a simple operation to sum two Arabic digits using neural network predicates (`arabic_digit/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic and classical logic components, and ensure compliance with DeepProbLog integration requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Queries and Results**:  
  - `operation(1, 2, Z).`  
    - Expected: `Z = 3` (assuming `arabic_digit(1, 1)` and `arabic_digit(2, 2)` are correctly defined).  
    - Actual: Depends on the neural network output probabilities for `arabic_digit/2`.  
  - `operation(5, 5, Z).`  
    - Expected: `Z = 10`.  
    - Actual: Depends on the neural network output probabilities.  

- **Verification**:  
  - If the neural network outputs deterministic values (e.g., `P(arabic_digit(1, 1)) = 1.0`), all tests pass.  
  - **Conclusion**: "All tests passed (no failures)" if the neural network outputs align with expected values.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  - The predicate `operation/3` is correctly defined (lines 5–7).  
  - The neural network predicates (`arabic_digit/2`, `telugu_digit/2`, `urdu_digit/2`) are syntactically valid.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog**:  
  - The rule `operation(X, Y, Z)` is logically correct and terminates for valid inputs.  
  - Recursion is not used, so termination is guaranteed.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not explicitly use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.7::fact`).  
  - Neural network outputs (`nn/4`) are treated as probabilistic facts, but their probabilities are not manually specified.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The `nn/4` predicates indicate neural network integration.  
  - **Verification**: The fusion of neural outputs (`arabic_digit/2`) with logical reasoning (`operation/3`) is correct.  
  - **Edge Case**: If the neural network outputs low probabilities for correct digits, the sum may fail.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met (simple arithmetic).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Partially met (neural outputs are probabilistic, but no explicit probabilities are defined).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Met (via `nn/4`).  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined digits (e.g., `arabic_digit(10, _)`) will cause the predicate to fail.  
  - Non-integer inputs are not handled.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | No explicit probabilities   | Low confidence in results  | Define probabilities for `nn/4`.    |
| 2   | Undefined digit handling    | Predicate fails            | Add guards for valid inputs.        |
| 3   | Non-integer inputs          | Predicate fails            | Validate input types.               |

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
