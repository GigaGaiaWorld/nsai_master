System: You are a coding assistant. You should use the available tools to complete the task.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

nn(arabic_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: arabic_digit(X,Y).
nn(telugu_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: telugu_digit(X,Y).
nn(urdu_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: urdu_digit(X,Y).
operation(X,Y,Z) :- 
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6FBBDE1D </HASH>
<Requirements>This is for Telugu net. Please calculate the sum of X and Y elements </Requirements></Langda>
.

</Code>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here
```

AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

nn(arabic_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: arabic_digit(X,Y).
nn(telugu_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: telugu_digit(X,Y).
nn(urdu_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: urdu_digit(X,Y).
operation(X,Y,Z) :- 
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6FBBDE1D </HASH>
<Requirements>This is for Telugu net. Please calculate the sum of X and Y elements </Requirements></Langda>
.

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

nn(arabic_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: arabic_digit(X,Y).
nn(telugu_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: telugu_digit(X,Y).
nn(urdu_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: urdu_digit(X,Y).

operation(X, Y, Z) :-
    telugu_digit(X, X_val),
    telugu_digit(Y, Y_val),
    Z is X_val + Y_val.

<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
