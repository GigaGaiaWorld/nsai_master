Okay, I need to solve this Prolog problem. Let me read the user's instructions carefully.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The code then uses these classifications to determine an outcome based on the difference between the labels.

The user wants to add new rules. The first condition is: when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is classified as 1 and event2 as 3, then the sequence should be 0. The second condition is: when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then the sequence is 1.

I need to write Prolog clauses for these conditions. Let me think about how to structure them.

First, I'll create a new predicate, maybe called condition_outcome, that takes the timestamp, ID1, ID2, and the outcome. This predicate will check the timestamp range and the ID conditions.

For the first condition: T between 50 and 250, ID1=1, ID2=3. So, I'll write:
outcome(0, ID1, ID2) if T is in that range and IDs match.

Similarly, for the second condition: T between 100 and 300, ID1=0, ID2=3. So, outcome(1, ID1, ID2) under those conditions.

I should also make sure that these new rules are added without modifying the existing code. So, I'll add them after the existing outcome definitions.

Wait, but in Prolog, the order matters. The existing outcome predicate has two clauses: one for when the difference is exactly 2, and another for when it's not. My new conditions should perhaps override or add to these.

Hmm, maybe I should adjust the outcome predicate to include these new conditions. Alternatively, create a new layer that checks these specific cases first.

Alternatively, perhaps the new conditions should be part of the outcome predicate. So, I can add new clauses to outcome that check the timestamp and IDs.

Wait, the existing outcome predicate only looks at the difference between ID1 and ID2. The new conditions are based on both the timestamp and specific ID values. So, I need to create a new way to determine the outcome.

Maybe I should create a new predicate, say condition_outcome, which encapsulates these new rules. Then, in the detectEvent predicate, I can first check if any of these conditions apply, and if so, set the EventID accordingly. If not, fall back to the existing outcome calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can modify the detectEvent predicate to include these conditions. Let me think.

The detectEvent predicate currently uses coin1 and coin2 to get ID1 and ID2, then calls outcome to determine EventID. I can add additional conditions before that.

So, in detectEvent, after getting ID1 and ID2, I can check if T is between 50 and 250, and ID1=1, ID2=3. If so, set EventID to 0. Else, check if T is between 100 and 300, and ID1=0, ID2=3. If so, set EventID to 1. Else, use the existing outcome rules.

But how to implement this in Prolog? Maybe using conditional statements.

Wait, Prolog doesn't have conditional statements like if-else, but we can use clauses with conditions in the head.

Alternatively, I can write separate clauses for detectEvent that handle these specific cases.

So, I can add:

detectEvent(sequence=0, T) :-
    coin1(1, T),
    coin2(3, T),
    T >=50,
    T =<250.

detectEvent(sequence=1, T) :-
    coin1(0, T),
    coin2(3, T),
    T >=100,
    T =<300.

And then the general case would be the existing one, which uses outcome.

But wait, the existing detectEvent is a single clause. So, adding new clauses with specific conditions will make Prolog try them first. If they match, it will use those; otherwise, it will proceed to the existing clause.

But I need to ensure that the existing clause is still used when the new conditions don't apply. So, the order of clauses matters. The new specific clauses should come before the general one.

So, I'll add the two new clauses before the existing detectEvent clause.

Wait, but the existing detectEvent is a single clause. So, I can add the new clauses above it.

Let me structure it:

detectEvent(sequence=0, T) :-
    coin1(1, T),
    coin2(3, T),
    T >=50,
    T =<250.

detectEvent(sequence=1, T) :-
    coin1(0, T),
    coin2(3, T),
    T >=100,
    T =<300.

detectEvent(sequence=EventID,T) :-
    coin1(ID1, T),
    coin2(ID2, T),
    outcome(EventID, ID1, ID2).

This way, when a query is made, Prolog will first check if the specific conditions are met, and if so, it will assign the corresponding sequence. Otherwise, it will use the general outcome.

I think this should work. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, adding these two new clauses before the existing detectEvent clause.

I should also make sure that the variables are correctly used. In the new clauses, I'm directly using 1, 3, 0, etc., as ID1 and ID2, which should match the event classifications.

Testing this with the provided examples: for instance, if at T=100, ID1=0 and ID2=3, then the second clause will trigger and set sequence=1. Similarly, at T=200, ID1=1 and ID2=3, the first clause sets sequence=0.

I think this covers the user's requirements without modifying the existing code, just adding new clauses.
