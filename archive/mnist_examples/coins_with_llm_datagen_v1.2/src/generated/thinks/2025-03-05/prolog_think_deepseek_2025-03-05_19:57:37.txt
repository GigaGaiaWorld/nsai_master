Okay, I need to solve this Prolog problem based on the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding the existing code and the new requirements.

First, the existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The events are connected through happensAt and event predicates. The outcome is determined by the difference between the two event labels.

The user wants to add new rules. The first new rule is: when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then the sequence should be 0. The second rule is: when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then the sequence should be 1.

I need to modify the Prolog rules to include these conditions. I'll start by looking at the existing detectEvent rule. It currently uses outcome, which is based on the absolute difference. But now, I need to add additional conditions based on the timestamp ranges and specific event labels.

I think I should create new outcome rules that check both the timestamp and the event labels. So, I'll add two new clauses for outcome. The first will check if T is between 50 and 250, and ID1 is 1 and ID2 is 3, then set EventID to 0. The second will check if T is between 100 and 300, and ID1 is 0 and ID2 is 3, then set EventID to 1.

I also need to make sure that these new rules are added before the existing outcome rules so that they take precedence. Otherwise, the existing rules might override the new ones.

Next, I'll update the detectEvent rule to include these new conditions. It should first check the new outcome rules and then fall back to the existing ones.

I should also add comments to explain each part of the code for clarity. This will help anyone reading the code understand the new rules and how they fit into the existing logic.

Now, I'll structure the new code. I'll add the two new outcome clauses first, followed by the existing ones. Then, I'll modify the detectEvent rule to include the new conditions.

I need to ensure that the Prolog syntax is correct. Using between(T, 50, 250) for the timestamp checks and checking the event labels with ID1 and ID2. Also, the order of clauses matters because Prolog uses a top-down approach.

Finally, I'll test the code with the provided examples to make sure it works as expected. For instance, when T is 0, it should use the existing rules, but when T is within the new ranges, it should apply the new outcome rules.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to include all necessary parts and comments.
