Okay, I need to modify the Prolog rules based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the new requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, nn/3, which classify events into labels. Then, there are coin1 and coin2 predicates that extract the labels for each event at a given timestamp. The outcome determines the sequence based on the difference between the labels.

The user wants to add new rules. The first condition is: when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then the sequence is 0. The second condition is: when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then the sequence is 1.

So, I need to create new outcome rules that check these conditions. I'll add two new clauses for outcome/3. Each will check the timestamp range and the specific labels, then set the sequence accordingly.

I should also make sure that these new rules are added correctly without conflicting with the existing ones. I'll place them before the existing outcome definitions to prioritize them, but in Prolog, the order matters, so I'll add them after the existing ones but before the detectEvent predicate.

Wait, no, in Prolog, the order of clauses determines the search order. So, if I add the new specific cases after the existing outcome clauses, they might not be triggered because the existing ones could match first. Hmm, maybe I should adjust the order so that the new specific cases are checked first.

Alternatively, I can structure the new outcome clauses to include the timestamp condition. So, I'll write:

outcome(0, ID1, ID2) :- happensAt(X,Y,T), T >=50, T <=250, ID1=1, ID2=3.

Similarly for the second condition.

Wait, but happensAt is a fact that's already used in coin1 and coin2. So, in the outcome, I can directly check the timestamp T that's passed from detectEvent.

Wait, in the detectEvent predicate, T is the timestamp. So, in the outcome, I can directly use T to check the range.

So, the new outcome clauses would be:

outcome(0, ID1, ID2) :- T >=50, T <=250, ID1=1, ID2=3.

outcome(1, ID2, ID1) :- T >=100, T <=300, ID1=0, ID2=3.

Wait, no, the outcome is defined as outcome(EventID, ID1, ID2). So, for the first condition, when T is between 50 and 250, and ID1 is 1, ID2 is 3, then EventID is 0.

Similarly, when T is between 100 and 300, ID1 is 0, ID2 is 3, then EventID is 1.

So, the clauses would be:

outcome(0, ID1, ID2) :- T >=50, T <=250, ID1=1, ID2=3.

outcome(1, ID1, ID2) :- T >=100, T <=300, ID1=0, ID2=3.

But wait, in Prolog, variables are case-sensitive. So, I need to ensure that T is the same variable as in detectEvent. Since detectEvent passes T to outcome, I can use T directly in the outcome clauses.

So, I'll add these two new clauses before the existing outcome definitions to ensure they are checked first. That way, if the conditions are met, the specific outcome is chosen; otherwise, it falls back to the general cases.

I should also make sure that the existing outcome clauses are still valid. The existing ones are:

outcome(1, ID1, ID2) :- abs(ID1 - ID2) =:= 2.

outcome(0, ID1, ID2) :- abs(ID1 - ID2) =\= 2.

So, the new specific cases will override the general ones when the conditions are met.

I think that's the correct approach. Now, I'll write the new outcome clauses with the timestamp conditions and the specific label checks.
