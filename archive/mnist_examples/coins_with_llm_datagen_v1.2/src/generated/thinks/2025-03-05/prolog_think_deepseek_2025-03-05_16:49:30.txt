Okay, I need to help the user by generating new Prolog code based on their instructions. Let me start by understanding the existing code they provided.

So, the existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which process inputs X and produce outputs Y. These networks are for events event1 and event2, which are classified into labels [0,1] and [2,3] respectively.

The user wants me to add new code that combines the outputs of these two networks. The new code should take into account the simultaneous events (events happening at the same timestamp) and apply logical rules to determine the final event outcome based on the difference between the two event labels.

First, I need to parse the facts provided. The facts are in the form of happensAt(Event1, Event6, Timestamp) and events in the form event(Event_name, Label). These events are classified into specific classes based on their labels.

The task is to create Prolog code that implements this logic. I should ensure that the new code follows Prolog syntax, adding necessary comments to explain each part's functionality.

Looking at the examples given, I see that happensAt(boy, alien, 12) means that two events (boy and alien) occurred at timestamp 12. Similarly, other examples show events with different timestamps and classifications.

The user also provided some queries where detectEvent(sequence=0, 0) and others. These queries likely involve checking the classification of sequences based on the events' timestamps and labels.

The user's instructions mention that when the timestamp is between 50-250, if event1 and event2 are classified as 1 and 3, then the sequence should be 0. Similarly, for timestamps between 100-300, if the events are 0 and 3, the sequence should be 1.

I need to translate these conditions into Prolog rules, ensuring that the new code correctly implements this logic without altering the existing code. Also, I should make sure the new code is compatible with the existing code in terms of content.

So, I'll start by defining the new predicates and rules. I'll create rules that check the conditions on the timestamps and event labels, then combine the results of the two networks to produce the final outcome.

I should also ensure that all variables are correctly referenced and that the Prolog syntax is followed. Adding comments to each part to explain their purpose will make the code understandable.

Finally, I'll structure the code so that it's clear how each part contributes to the overall logic. This way, the new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.
