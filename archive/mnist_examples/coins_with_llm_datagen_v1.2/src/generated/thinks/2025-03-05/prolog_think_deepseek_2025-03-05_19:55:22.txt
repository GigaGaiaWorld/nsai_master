Okay, I need to modify the Prolog rules based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the new requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, nn/3, which classify events into labels. Then, there are coin1 and coin2 predicates that extract the labels for each event at a given timestamp. The outcome determines the sequence based on the difference between the labels.

The user wants to add new rules. The first condition is: when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then the sequence is 0. The second condition is: when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then the sequence is 1.

So, I need to create new outcome rules that check these conditions. I'll add two new outcome facts. Each will check the timestamp range, the event1 and event2 labels, and set the sequence accordingly.

I should also make sure that these new rules are added correctly without conflicting with the existing ones. I'll place them after the existing outcome definitions so they can be considered in the detectEvent predicate.

I'll write the new outcome facts with the appropriate conditions using Prolog's syntax, including the timestamp ranges and label checks. This way, when detectEvent is called, it will consider these new rules along with the existing ones.
