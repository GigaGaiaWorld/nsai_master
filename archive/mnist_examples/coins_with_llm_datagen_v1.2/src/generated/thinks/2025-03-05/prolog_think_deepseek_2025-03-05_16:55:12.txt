Okay, I need to solve this Prolog problem. Let me read the user's instructions carefully.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The code then uses these classifications to determine an outcome based on the difference between the labels.

The user wants to add new rules. The first condition is: when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is classified as 1 while event2 is 3, the sequence should be 0. The second condition is: when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 while event2 is 3, the sequence should be 1.

I need to write Prolog clauses for these conditions. Let me think about how to structure them.

First, I'll create a new predicate, maybe called condition_outcome, that takes the timestamp, ID1, ID2, and the outcome. This predicate will check the timestamp range and the classifications, then set the outcome accordingly.

For the first condition: T between 50 and 250, ID1=1, ID2=3 → outcome 0. So the clause would be:

condition_outcome(T, ID1, ID2, 0) :- T >=50, T <=250, ID1=1, ID2=3.

Similarly, the second condition: T between 100 and 300, ID1=0, ID2=3 → outcome 1. So:

condition_outcome(T, ID1, ID2, 1) :- T >=100, T <=300, ID1=0, ID2=3.

Now, I need to integrate this into the existing detectEvent predicate. Currently, detectEvent uses outcome/3, which only considers the absolute difference. I'll modify it to first check the new conditions using condition_outcome. If they don't match, it falls back to the original outcome.

So the new detectEvent will be:

detectEvent(sequence=EventID, T) :- 
    coin1(ID1, T),
    coin2(ID2, T),
    ( condition_outcome(T, ID1, ID2, EventID) ; outcome(EventID, ID1, ID2) ).

This way, if the condition_outcome clause matches, it sets EventID accordingly. If not, it uses the original outcome based on the difference.

I should also make sure that the new clauses are added after the existing code and that they are properly commented for clarity.

Let me double-check the syntax. Using ; in Prolog is a way to provide multiple clauses, but in this case, I'm using it within the detectEvent clause to try both conditions. Wait, no, actually, in Prolog, the semicolon acts as an OR operator. So the detectEvent clause will first try condition_outcome, and if that fails, it will try outcome.

Wait, no, the way I wrote it is:

( condition_outcome(T, ID1, ID2, EventID) ; outcome(EventID, ID1, ID2) )

This means that if condition_outcome succeeds, it will proceed, else it will try outcome. That's correct.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, adding the new condition_outcome clauses and modifying detectEvent to include them.
