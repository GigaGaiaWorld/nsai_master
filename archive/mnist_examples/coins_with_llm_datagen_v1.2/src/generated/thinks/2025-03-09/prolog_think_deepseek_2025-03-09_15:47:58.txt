Okay, I need to solve this problem by generating new DeepProblog code based on the existing code and the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding the problem context and the existing code.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which are used to classify events. The nn predicates define event1 and event2 with their respective output domains. The facts are given in happensAt and event predicates, but I shouldn't modify those.

The task is to create new code that determines the final event outcome based on the difference between the two event labels. Specifically, when the absolute difference is 2, the output should be 1; otherwise, 0.

Looking at the existing code, there are coin1 and coin2 predicates that extract IDs from events at a given time T. Then, event_table links these IDs to an EventID. The detectEvent predicate combines these to detect an event at time T.

The user's instruction is to add a new rule that checks the absolute difference between event1 and event2 outputs. So, I need to create a new predicate, maybe called result, which takes the absolute difference and sets win to 1 or 0 accordingly.

I should consider how to compute the absolute difference in Prolog. Since Prolog doesn't support the absolute value function directly in this context, I'll need to handle it using logical conditions. The absolute difference being 2 means that either ID1 - ID2 = 2 or ID2 - ID1 = 2.

So, I'll define two rules for result: one where ID1 - ID2 equals 2, and another where ID2 - ID1 equals 2. In both cases, win is set to 1. Otherwise, win is 0.

I'll structure the new code as follows:

1. Define the result predicate with four arguments: EventID, T, win, and the result value.
2. Use the existing detectEvent to get EventID at time T.
3. For each possible EventID, check if the absolute difference between event1 and event2 IDs is 2.
4. If yes, set win to 1; else, set it to 0.

I need to ensure that the new code doesn't modify the existing code and follows DeepProblog syntax. Also, I should use =:= for equality checks and avoid using unsupported syntax like if-then-else.

Putting it all together, I'll write the result predicate with the necessary conditions to check the absolute difference and assign the appropriate win value.
