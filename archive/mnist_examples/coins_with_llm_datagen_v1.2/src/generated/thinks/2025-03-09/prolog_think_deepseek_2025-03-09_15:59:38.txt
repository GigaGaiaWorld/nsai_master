Okay, I need to modify the given DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the new requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, event1 and event2, which classify events into different labels. It then uses happensAt facts to combine events occurring at the same timestamp. The coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels for each event at a given time. The event_table links these labels to an EventID, which determines the outcome.

The user wants to change the result calculation. The new rules are:

1. When the absolute difference between event1 and event2 labels is 2, result is 1; else 0.
2. Additional rules:
   - If timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then result is 0.
   - If timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then result is 1.

First, I'll create a new predicate, compute_result, that takes the labels and timestamp. It will handle the absolute difference and the additional conditions.

For the absolute difference, I'll compute |ID1 - ID2| and check if it equals 2. If so, set Win to 1; else, 0.

Next, I'll handle the additional rules. I'll check if the timestamp is within the specified ranges and the labels match the conditions. These will override the general case.

I'll structure compute_result with these conditions. Then, in detectEvent, after getting EventID, I'll call compute_result to determine Win and assert result(win=Win, T).

I need to ensure that the code follows DeepProblog syntax, avoiding unsupported constructs. I'll use standard logical connections and =:= for comparisons.

Testing the code with sample facts to ensure it works as intended. For example, at T=100, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, the result should be 1 due to the second additional rule.

Finally, I'll make sure the code is clean, with comments explaining each part, and that it's directly executable without any syntax errors.
