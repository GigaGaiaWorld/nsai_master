Okay, I need to solve this DeepProblog problem. Let me start by understanding the existing code and the user's requirements.

First, the existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The event1 and event2 predicates use these networks. Then, there are coin1 and coin2 rules that extract the IDs based on happensAt facts. The event_table links these IDs to an EventID, which determines the outcome.

The user wants to add new rules based on specific conditions. The main task is to generate new code that implements these rules without modifying the existing code.

The first user requirement is: when the absolute difference between e1 and e2 outputs is 2, win is 1; else 0. So I'll create a rule that checks if the difference is 2 and sets win to 1. Otherwise, it sets win to 0.

Next, there are two additional rules. The first says that between timestamps 50-250, if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then the sequence is 0. The second says between 100-300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, sequence is 1.

I need to translate these into Prolog rules. Since DeepProblog doesn't support if-then syntax, I'll use multiple clauses.

For the first additional rule: I'll check if T is between 50 and 250, event1 is 1, event2 is 3, then sequence is 0. Similarly for the second rule, T between 100-300, event1 0, event2 3, sequence 1.

I also need to ensure that the new rules are compatible with the existing code. So I'll add them after the existing rules.

I should use the correct syntax, like =:= for equality and \= for inequality. Also, use and, or, and not as needed.

Let me structure the new rules step by step. First, the win rule based on the difference. Then the two additional sequence rules.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
