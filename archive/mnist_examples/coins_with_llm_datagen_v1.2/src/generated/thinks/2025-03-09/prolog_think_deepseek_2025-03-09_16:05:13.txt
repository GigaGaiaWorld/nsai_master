Okay, I need to modify the given DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the new requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, event1 and event2, which classify events into different labels. It then uses happensAt facts to combine events at the same timestamp. The coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels for each event at a given time. The event_table links these labels to an EventID, which determines the outcome.

The user wants to change the result based on two conditions:

1. When the absolute difference between event1 and event2 labels is 2, the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
2. Additional rules:
   - If timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then result is 0.
   - If timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then result is 1.

First, I'll create a new predicate diff_event to compute the absolute difference. Since Prolog doesn't support functions directly, I'll use a helper predicate to calculate it.

Next, I'll define the result predicate. The main rule checks if the difference is 2. If so, result is 1; else, 0. But I need to override this with the additional rules.

For the additional rules, I'll create specific result predicates that handle the timestamp ranges and specific label combinations. These will take precedence over the general rule because Prolog processes rules in order.

I'll structure the code so that the specific cases are checked first. If they don't apply, the general case is used.

I also need to ensure that the happensAt and event predicates are correctly used. The detectEvent predicate is already combining the events, so I'll build on that.

Testing the code with sample facts will help verify if the rules are correctly applied. For example, at timestamp 100, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, the result should be 1, overriding the general rule which would have a difference of 3, leading to result 0.

I should also make sure to use the correct Prolog syntax, avoiding unsupported constructs and using =:= for equality checks.

Finally, I'll add comments to explain each part of the code for clarity.
