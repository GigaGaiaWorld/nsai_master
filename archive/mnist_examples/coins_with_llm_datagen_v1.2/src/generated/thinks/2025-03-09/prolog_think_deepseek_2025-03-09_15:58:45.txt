Okay, I need to modify the given DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, event1 and event2, which classify events into different labels. The happensAt predicate lists events occurring at the same timestamp, and the coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels for each event. The event_table links these labels to an EventID, which determines the outcome.

The user wants to add new rules to determine the result as win=1 or 0 based on two conditions:

1. When the absolute difference between event1 and event2 labels is 2, set win=1. Otherwise, win=0.
2. Additional rules:
   - If timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1=1, event2=3, then win=0.
   - If timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1=0, event2=3, then win=1.

First, I'll create a result predicate that depends on the detectEvent. So, result(win=A, T) will use the EventID from detectEvent.

For the first condition, I'll compute the absolute difference. Since Prolog doesn't support functions directly, I'll use clauses to check if the difference is 2. So, if EventID is 1 or 2 (since 0-2=2 and 1-3=2), set win=1. Otherwise, win=0.

Next, the additional rules. I'll write separate clauses for result that check the timestamp ranges and specific event1 and event2 labels. For the first additional rule, when T is between 50 and 250, and event1=1, event2=3 (which is EventID 3), set win=0. For the second, when T is between 100 and 300, and event1=0, event2=3 (EventID 1), set win=1.

I need to ensure that these new rules are added correctly without conflicting with the existing logic. Also, I must use the correct syntax, avoiding unsupported constructs like if-then-else. Instead, I'll use multiple clauses with conditions.

I'll structure the result predicate with four clauses:

1. The general case based on EventID.
2. The first additional rule.
3. The second additional rule.
4. A default case where win=0 if none of the above apply.

Wait, but the additional rules should override the general case when their conditions are met. So, I'll order the clauses so that the specific cases come before the general one.

I'll also make sure to use =:= for equality checks and compare timestamps using >= and =<.

Putting it all together, I'll write the result predicate with these conditions, ensuring each clause correctly sets win based on the user's instructions.
