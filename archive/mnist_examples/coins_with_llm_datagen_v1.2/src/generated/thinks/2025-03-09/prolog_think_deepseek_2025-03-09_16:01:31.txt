Okay, I need to modify the given DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the new requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, event1 and event2, which classify events into different labels. It then uses happensAt facts to group events occurring at the same timestamp. The coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels for each event at a given timestamp. The event_table links combinations of these labels to an EventID, which is used by detectEvent to determine the final event.

The user wants to add new rules that determine the result as win=1 or 0 based on two conditions:

1. When the absolute difference between event1 and event2 labels is 2, result is 1; else 0.
2. Additional rules:
   - If timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then result is 0.
   - If timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then result is 1.

First, I'll create a result predicate that captures the main condition. Since DeepProblog doesn't support if-then, I'll use logical rules.

For the main condition, I'll compute the absolute difference. But since Prolog doesn't have absolute value, I'll write two clauses: one where ID1 - ID2 is 2 and another where ID2 - ID1 is 2.

Next, I'll handle the additional rules. These are specific to certain timestamp ranges and label combinations. I'll write separate clauses for each condition, checking the timestamp range and the labels, then setting the result accordingly.

I need to ensure that all conditions are covered without overlapping. So, I'll structure the result predicate with these specific cases first, followed by the general case based on the difference.

I'll also make sure to use the correct syntax, like =:= for equality and \= for inequality, and avoid using unsupported constructs.

Putting it all together, I'll add the new result clauses after the existing code, ensuring they correctly implement the user's requirements.
