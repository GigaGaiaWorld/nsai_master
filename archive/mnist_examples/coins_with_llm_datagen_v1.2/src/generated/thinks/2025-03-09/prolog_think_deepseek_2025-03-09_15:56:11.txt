Okay, I need to solve this DeepProblog problem. Let me start by understanding the existing code and the user's requirements.

First, the existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The event1 and event2 predicates use these networks. Then, there are coin1 and coin2 rules that extract the IDs based on happensAt facts. The event_table links these IDs to an EventID, which determines the outcome.

The user wants to add new rules based on specific conditions. The main goal is to modify the result based on the difference between event1 and event2 outputs and some timestamp-based conditions.

The first condition is that when the absolute difference between e1 and e2 is 2, the win is 1; else, it's 0. So I'll create a rule result_win that checks if the difference is 2 using abs/2 and sets Win accordingly.

Next, there are two additional rules. The first is when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then win is 0. The second is when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then win is 1.

I need to structure these as separate rules. For each, I'll use the detectEvent to get EventID and then check the conditions. For the timestamp ranges, I'll use T >= 50 and T =< 250, etc. Also, I'll compare the IDs using =:= since that's the correct operator in Prolog.

I should also ensure that the new rules are compatible with the existing code. So, I'll add them after the existing rules without modifying anything.

I need to make sure that the syntax is correct. Since DeepProblog doesn't support if-then, I'll use multiple clauses. Also, for numerical comparisons, I'll use =<, >=, =:=, etc.

Putting it all together, I'll write the result_win rule first, then the two additional rules. Each rule will have the necessary conditions and set Win to 0 or 1 accordingly.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, adding comments for clarity.
