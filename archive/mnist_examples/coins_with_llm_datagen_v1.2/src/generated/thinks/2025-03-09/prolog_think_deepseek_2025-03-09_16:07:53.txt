Okay, I need to modify the existing DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand what the current code does and what changes are required.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The happensAt predicate is used to indicate that multiple events occur at the same timestamp. The coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the event information from these happensAt facts. Then, the event_table maps combinations of event1 and event2 labels to an EventID. The detectEvent predicate uses this table to determine the EventID at a specific timestamp. Finally, the result predicates determine whether win is 1 or 0 based on the EventID.

The user has added two new rules that need to be incorporated:

1. When the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then win is 0.
2. When the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then win is 1.

I need to translate these into DeepProblog rules without using if-then syntax. So, I'll create new result predicates that handle these conditions.

First, I'll add a new result predicate for the first condition. It should check if the timestamp T is between 50 and 250, event1 is 1, event2 is 3, and set win=0. Similarly, for the second condition, check if T is between 100 and 300, event1 is 0, event2 is 3, and set win=1.

I also need to ensure that the existing result predicates are not overridden. So, I'll add these as separate rules. Additionally, I should include comments explaining each part for clarity.

I should use the correct syntax, using "=:=" for equality and ">=<=" for inequalities. Also, since DeepProblog doesn't support if-then, I'll structure the rules using conjunctions.

So, the new rules will be:

result(win=0, T) :- T >= 50, T <= 250, coin1(1, T), coin2(3, T).
result(win=1, T) :- T >= 100, T <= 300, coin1(0, T), coin2(3, T).

I'll add these after the existing result rules and include comments to explain their purpose.

I should also make sure that the code remains executable, so I'll check for any syntax errors and ensure all variables are correctly used.

Finally, I'll present the modified code with the new rules and comments, ensuring it's properly formatted and follows the user's instructions.
