Okay, I need to modify the existing DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand what the current code does and then see how to incorporate the new rules.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The events are connected through happensAt facts, which indicate that multiple events occur at the same timestamp. The coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the event IDs from these happensAt facts. Then, the event_table maps combinations of these IDs to an EventID. The detectEvent predicate uses this to determine the EventID at a specific timestamp. Finally, the result predicates determine if win is 1 or 0 based on the EventID.

Now, the user wants to add two new rules:

1. When the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then win is 0.
2. When the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then win is 1.

I need to translate these into DeepProblog rules. Let me break it down.

First, I'll create new predicates for each condition. For the first rule, I'll check if T is >=50 and <=250, then check if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3. Then, set win=0.

Similarly, for the second rule, check if T is >=100 and <=300, event1 is 0, and event2 is 3, then set win=1.

I should also ensure that these new rules are added without conflicting with the existing result predicates. So, I'll add them as separate clauses for result(win=A, T).

I need to use the correct syntax. Since DeepProblog doesn't support if-then syntax, I'll use logical conjunctions. For numerical comparisons, I'll use =< for less than or equal to, and >= is written as >=. For equality, I'll use =:=.

So, for the first new rule:

result(win=0, T) :-
    T >= 50,
    T <= 250,
    coin1(1, T),
    coin2(3, T).

Wait, no. Because coin1 and coin2 extract ID1 and ID2 from the events. So, in the first new rule, event1 is 1 and event2 is 3. So, coin1 should give ID1=1, and coin2 should give ID2=3.

But wait, in the existing code, event1(X, ID1) and event2(Y, ID2). So, for a given T, coin1(ID1, T) and coin2(ID2, T) will give the IDs. So, in the new rules, I can directly use these predicates.

So, the first new rule would be:

result(win=0, T) :-
    T >= 50,
    T =< 250,
    coin1(1, T),
    coin2(3, T).

Similarly, the second new rule:

result(win=1, T) :-
    T >= 100,
    T =< 300,
    coin1(0, T),
    coin2(3, T).

I should add these as separate result clauses. Also, I need to make sure that these rules are added correctly without conflicting with the existing ones.

Wait, but the existing result predicates are based on EventID. The new rules are based directly on the event1 and event2 IDs, bypassing the event_table. So, I need to make sure that these new rules are considered alongside the existing ones.

I think adding them as separate clauses is correct because Prolog will consider all matching clauses when determining the result.

So, I'll add these two new result clauses after the existing ones.

I should also test if these rules might overlap or conflict. For example, if a timestamp is between 100 and 250, both rules might apply if the conditions are met. But since each rule sets a different win value, I need to ensure that the correct one takes precedence. However, in Prolog, the order of clauses matters, and the first matching clause will be used. So, I should place the more specific rules first or adjust accordingly. But since the user hasn't specified priority, I'll add them as separate clauses, and the Prolog engine will handle them based on the order.

Wait, but in the existing code, the result is determined based on EventID, which is derived from the event_table. The new rules are based on direct event1 and event2 IDs and specific timestamp ranges. So, these new rules might override the existing ones if they match. But the user's instructions are to add these rules, so I'll proceed as per the instructions.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the new code by adding these two result clauses after the existing ones, ensuring the correct syntax and variable usage.
