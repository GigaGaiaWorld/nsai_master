Okay, I need to modify the existing DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand what the current code does and then see how to incorporate the new rules.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. These are linked to event1 and event2 predicates. Then, there are coin1 and coin2 predicates that extract the event IDs at a specific timestamp. The event_table maps combinations of these IDs to an EventID, which determines the result as win=1 or win=0.

The user wants to add two new rules:

1. When the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then win=0.
2. When the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then win=1.

I need to translate these into DeepProblog rules without using if-then syntax. So, I'll create new result predicates that handle these conditions.

First, for the first new rule: T between 50 and 250, event1=1, event2=3 â†’ win=0.

I'll write a result predicate that checks if T is >=50 and <=250, then checks if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3. Then, set win=0.

Similarly, for the second rule: T between 100 and 300, event1=0, event2=3 â†’ win=1.

I'll create another result predicate that checks T >=100 and <=300, event1=0, event2=3, then set win=1.

I also need to ensure that these new rules are added correctly without conflicting with the existing ones. So, I'll add them after the existing result definitions.

I should use the correct syntax, using =< for less than or equal to, and =:= for equality checks. Also, I'll structure the rules using logical conjunctions.

Let me draft the new rules:

For the first new rule:
result(win=0, T) :-
    T >= 50,
    T <= 250,
    coin1(1, T),
    coin2(3, T).

For the second new rule:
result(win=1, T) :-
    T >= 100,
    T <= 300,
    coin1(0, T),
    coin2(3, T).

I think this should cover the user's requirements. Now, I'll integrate these into the existing code, making sure to place them after the existing result predicates to avoid conflicts.
