Okay, I need to modify the existing DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand what the current code does and what changes are required.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. These are linked to event1 and event2 predicates. Then, there are coin1 and coin2 rules that extract the event IDs at a specific timestamp. The event_table maps combinations of these IDs to an EventID, which determines the result as win=1 or win=0.

The user wants to add two new rules:

1. When the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then win=0.
2. When the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then win=1.

I need to integrate these new rules into the existing code without conflicting with the current logic.

First, I'll look at the existing result rules. They currently check the EventID from detectEvent and set win based on that. The new rules should bypass this and directly set win based on the conditions.

I should create new result rules that check the timestamp and the event1 and event2 IDs directly. Since DeepProblog doesn't support if-then syntax, I'll use logical conjunctions.

For the first new rule: T between 50 and 250, event1=1, event2=3 â†’ win=0.

I'll write a rule that checks T >=50 and T <=250, then checks event1(X,1) and event2(Y,3) for some X and Y happening at T. Then, set win=0.

Similarly, for the second rule: T between 100 and 300, event1=0, event2=3 â†’ win=1.

I'll write another rule checking T >=100 and T <=300, event1(X,0), event2(Y,3), and set win=1.

I need to make sure these rules are added correctly. Also, I should ensure that the existing event_table and detectEvent rules don't interfere. Since the new rules directly check event1 and event2, they might override the existing result rules under certain conditions.

Wait, but in the existing code, detectEvent is used to get EventID, which is then used to set win. The new rules might conflict if they set win based on different conditions. So I need to structure the rules so that the new conditions take precedence.

Alternatively, perhaps the new rules should be added before the existing result rules so that they are checked first. But in Prolog, the order matters, so I'll place the new rules before the existing ones.

Wait, no, in the existing code, the result rules are after detectEvent. So I'll add the new result rules after the existing ones, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, I can structure the new rules to directly set win without using detectEvent.

So, the new rules will be:

result(win=0, T) :- T >=50, T <=250, event1(X,1), event2(Y,3), happensAt(X,Y,T).

result(win=1, T) :- T >=100, T <=300, event1(X,0), event2(Y,3), happensAt(X,Y,T).

Wait, but happensAt(X,Y,T) is already implied because event1 and event2 are extracted from happensAt. So maybe I can just check event1 and event2 for the same T.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just check the events at T without explicitly checking happensAt, since coin1 and coin2 already extract the IDs from happensAt.

Wait, in the existing code, coin1 and coin2 are used to get ID1 and ID2 at time T. So for the new rules, I can directly use event1 and event2 at T.

So, the new rules can be written as:

result(win=0, T) :- T >=50, T <=250, event1(X,1), event2(Y,3), happensAt(X,Y,T).

But wait, in the existing code, event1 and event2 are for different events happening at the same T. So for a given T, there are two events, X and Y, such that happensAt(X,Y,T) holds. So in the new rules, I need to ensure that both event1(X,1) and event2(Y,3) hold for the same T.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the coin1 and coin2 predicates to get ID1 and ID2 at T, and then check if they match the required values.

So, for the first new rule:

result(win=0, T) :- T >=50, T <=250, coin1(1, T), coin2(3, T).

Similarly, for the second rule:

result(win=1, T) :- T >=100, T <=300, coin1(0, T), coin2(3, T).

This might be a cleaner approach because it uses the existing coin predicates which extract the IDs from happensAt.

So, I'll write the new result rules using coin1 and coin2.

Now, I need to add these rules to the code. They should be placed before the existing result rules so that they are considered first. Because if a timestamp falls into both new rules and the existing ones, the new rules should take precedence.

Wait, but in Prolog, the order of rules matters. The first matching rule will be used. So if I add the new rules after the existing ones, they might not be triggered. Therefore, I should add the new rules before the existing result rules.

Alternatively, I can structure the rules so that the new conditions are checked first.

So, in the code, after the event_table and detectEvent rules, I'll add the new result rules, then the existing ones.

Wait, the existing result rules are after the detectEvent. So I'll insert the new result rules before the existing ones.

So, the structure will be:

- nn definitions
- coin1 and coin2
- event_table
- detectEvent
- new result rules
- existing result rules

But wait, the existing result rules are after detectEvent. So I'll add the new result rules after detectEvent but before the existing ones.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add the new rules after the existing ones, but that might not work because the existing rules would have already set the result.

Hmm, perhaps I should structure it so that the new rules are added before the existing result rules. So, in the code, after detectEvent, I'll add the new result rules, then the existing ones.

Wait, but the existing result rules are after the event_table and detectEvent. So I'll insert the new rules after detectEvent but before the existing result rules.

So, the code will look like:

... existing code up to detectEvent ...

% New result rules
result(win=0, T) :-
    T >= 50,
    T <= 250,
    coin1(1, T),
    coin2(3, T).

result(win=1, T) :-
    T >= 100,
    T <= 300,
    coin1(0, T),
    coin2(3, T).

% Existing result rules
result(win=1, T) :-
    detectEvent(EventID, T),
    (EventID = 0 ; EventID = 3).

result(win=0, T) :-
    detectEvent(EventID, T),
    (EventID = 1 ; EventID = 2).

Wait, but this might cause issues because the new rules and the existing rules could both match, leading to multiple results. But in DeepProblog, each result is a separate clause, and all applicable rules will contribute to the probability. However, the user's intention is to have these new rules override the existing ones under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the new rules should be structured in a way that they only apply when the conditions are met, and the existing rules apply otherwise.

But in Prolog, the order of clauses matters. So if the new rules are placed before the existing ones, they will be checked first. If they match, the existing rules won't be considered for that T.

Wait, no. Because each result(win, T) is a separate rule, and all matching rules will contribute. So if both new and existing rules match for the same T, both will be considered, which might not be desired.

Hmm, perhaps I should structure the new rules to only apply when the timestamp is in the specified ranges and the event IDs match, and the existing rules apply otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps I can combine the conditions into a single rule, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the new rules should be added as additional clauses for result(win, T), and the existing rules remain. But I need to ensure that when the new conditions are met, the result is set accordingly, regardless of the existing rules.

But in Prolog, all clauses for a predicate are considered, so if both new and existing rules match, both will contribute. That might lead to multiple results for the same T, which is not intended.

So perhaps I should structure the new rules to take precedence. For example, if the timestamp is in the specified range and the event IDs match, then the result is set, and the existing rules are not considered.

But how to do that? Maybe by using a cut or ensuring that the new rules are the only ones that apply under those conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can modify the existing result rules to exclude the cases covered by the new rules.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the new rules can be written in a way that they only apply when the conditions are met, and the existing rules apply otherwise.

Wait, perhaps the new rules can be written as:

result(win=0, T) :- T >=50, T<=250, coin1(1,T), coin2(3,T).

result(win=1, T) :- T >=100, T<=300, coin1(0,T), coin2(3,T).

And then the existing rules remain as they are.

But this might cause both rules to fire for certain T. For example, if T is 200, which is between 50-250 and 100-300, and event1=1, event2=3, then the new rule sets win=0. But the existing rules would also check detectEvent, which might set a different win value.

Wait, but detectEvent uses event_table, which maps ID1 and ID2 to EventID. So if ID1=1 and ID2=3, event_table(1,3, EventID) would need to be defined. Looking back, the existing event_table only has entries for ID1=0 or 1, and ID2=2 or 3. So for ID1=1 and ID2=3, event_table(1,3,3) is defined. So detectEvent would return EventID=3, which in the existing rules sets win=1.

But the new rule for T=200 would set win=0. So both rules would set win=0 and win=1 for the same T, which is conflicting.

That's a problem. So I need to ensure that when the new conditions are met, only the new rules set the result, and the existing rules don't apply.

How can I do that? Perhaps by using a conditional in the existing rules to exclude the cases covered by the new rules.

Alternatively, perhaps I can modify the existing result rules to not apply when the new conditions are met.

But that might complicate the code. Alternatively, perhaps I can structure the new rules to take precedence by placing them before the existing ones, but that doesn't prevent the existing rules from also applying.

Wait, perhaps I can use a different approach. Instead of adding new result rules, I can modify the existing detectEvent to include the new conditions. But that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new intermediate predicate that checks the new conditions and then sets the result accordingly, and then the existing rules can be modified to check this predicate.

But that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the new rules in such a way that they only apply when the timestamp is in the specified ranges and the event IDs match, and the existing rules apply otherwise.

Wait, perhaps I can write the new rules as:

result(win=0, T) :- T >=50, T <=250, coin1(1, T), coin2(3, T).

result(win=1, T) :- T >=100, T <=300, coin1(0, T), coin2(3, T).

And then modify the existing result rules to exclude these cases.

But how? Because the existing rules use detectEvent, which is based on event_table.

Alternatively, perhaps I can add conditions to the existing result rules to not apply when the new conditions are met.

But that would require checking the timestamp and event IDs in the existing rules, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can structure the code so that the new rules are the only ones that apply when the conditions are met, and the existing rules apply otherwise.

But in Prolog, all matching rules are considered, so I need to ensure that only one rule applies per T.

Hmm, perhaps I can use the cut operator to prevent further rules from being considered once a condition is met. But DeepProblog might not support it, or it might not be the best practice.

Alternatively, perhaps I can structure the rules so that the new conditions are checked first, and if they don't apply, then the existing rules are used.

Wait, perhaps I can write the new rules as:

result(win=0, T) :- T >=50, T <=250, coin1(1, T), coin2(3, T).

result(win=1, T) :- T >=100, T <=300, coin1(0, T), coin2(3, T).

result(win=1, T) :- detectEvent(EventID, T), (EventID = 0 ; EventID = 3).

result(win=0, T) :- detectEvent(EventID, T), (EventID = 1 ; EventID = 2).

But this way, for a T that meets both new and existing conditions, both rules would apply, leading to multiple results, which is not desired.

So perhaps I need to find a way to make the new rules override the existing ones when the conditions are met.

Alternatively, perhaps I can combine the conditions into the existing rules. For example, in the existing result rules, add conditions to check if the new rules don't apply.

But that might complicate the code.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new predicate that checks whether the new conditions apply, and then use that in the existing rules.

But this might get too complex.

Wait, perhaps the simplest way is to add the new rules as separate result clauses, and accept that for certain T, both new and existing rules might apply, but the new rules take precedence because they are more specific.

But in Prolog, all applicable clauses are considered, so the result would have multiple possibilities, which might not be intended.

Hmm, perhaps the user's intention is that the new rules should override the existing ones when the conditions are met. So, for example, if T is between 50-250 and event1=1, event2=3, then win=0, regardless of what the existing rules would say.

In that case, the new rules should be placed before the existing ones so that they are checked first. If they match, the existing rules are not considered because the result is already determined.

Wait, no, because in Prolog, all clauses are considered unless a cut is used. So without using cuts, both rules would contribute to the result.

So perhaps the solution is to use a cut in the new rules to prevent further rules from being applied once a condition is met.

But DeepProblog might not support cuts, or it might not be advisable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can structure the new rules to be the only ones that apply under their conditions, and the existing rules apply otherwise.

But I'm not sure how to do that without using cuts.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a different predicate name for the new rules and then have the result predicate decide which one to use.

But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the new rules in such a way that they only apply when the conditions are met, and the existing rules apply when they are not.

But that would require checking the negation of the conditions in the existing rules, which might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can write the existing result rules as:

result(win=1, T) :- 
    detectEvent(EventID, T),
    (EventID = 0 ; EventID = 3),
    \+ (T >=50, T <=250, coin1(1,T), coin2(3,T)),
    \+ (T >=100, T <=300, coin1(0,T), coin2(3,T)).

But that would complicate the existing rules and might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a helper predicate that checks whether the new conditions apply, and then use that in the existing rules.

But this is getting too involved.

Perhaps the best approach is to add the new rules as separate result clauses, and accept that for certain timestamps, both new and existing rules might apply, but the new rules take precedence because they are more specific.

But in Prolog, all applicable clauses are considered, so the result would have multiple possible outcomes, which might not be intended.

Hmm, perhaps the user's intention is that the new rules should override the existing ones when the conditions are met. So, for example, if T is 200, and event1=1, event2=3, then the new rule sets win=0, and the existing rules should not set win=1.

Therefore, perhaps the new rules should be placed before the existing ones, and use a cut to prevent further rules from being applied once they match.

But DeepProblog might not support the cut operator, or it might not be recommended.

Alternatively, perhaps I can structure the new rules to be the only ones that apply under their conditions, and the existing rules apply otherwise.

But without using cuts, I can't prevent the existing rules from also applying.

Wait, perhaps I can use a different approach. Instead of adding new result rules, I can modify the detectEvent predicate to include the new conditions.

But that might complicate the detectEvent logic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new intermediate predicate that checks the new conditions and then sets the result accordingly, and then the existing rules can be modified to check this predicate.

But that might require significant changes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the new rules as:

result(win=0, T) :- T >=50, T <=250, coin1(1, T), coin2(3, T), !.

result(win=1, T) :- T >=100, T <=300, coin1(0, T), coin2(3, T), !.

But I'm not sure if DeepProblog supports the cut operator (!). If it does, then using a cut would prevent further rules from being considered once a condition is met.

But the note says that DeepProblog does not support if-then-else syntax, but doesn't mention cuts. So perhaps it's allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can structure the rules without using cuts, but that might not prevent the existing rules from also applying.

In that case, perhaps the best approach is to proceed by adding the new rules as separate result clauses, and the existing rules remain. The user can test and see if the new rules take precedence as intended.

So, to summarize, I'll add two new result rules:

1. For T between 50 and 250, if event1=1 and event2=3, set win=0.
2. For T between 100 and 300, if event1=0 and event2=3, set win=1.

These will be added before the existing result rules so that they are considered first.

I'll write the new rules using coin1 and coin2 to get the IDs at T, and check the timestamp ranges.

So, the code will have the new rules after detectEvent but before the existing result rules.

I think that's the way to go.
