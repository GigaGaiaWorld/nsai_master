Okay, I need to modify the existing DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand what the current code does.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The happensAt predicate is used to indicate that multiple events occur at the same timestamp. The coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels from each network for the events at a given timestamp. The outcome predicate determines the result based on the difference between the two labels, and the result predicate combines these to give a final win or loss.

Now, the user has provided specific instructions for when certain conditions should set the sequence to 0 or 1. The instructions are:

1. When the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if event1 is classified as 1 and event2 as 3, the sequence should be 0.
2. When the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, the sequence should be 1.

I need to translate these into DeepProblog rules. 

First, I'll create two new outcome predicates for these specific cases. Each will check the timestamp range and the event labels, then set the appropriate sequence value.

For the first condition, I'll write an outcome predicate that checks if T is between 50 and 250, ID1 is 1, and ID2 is 3. If so, it sets EventID to 0.

For the second condition, I'll write another outcome predicate that checks if T is between 100 and 300, ID1 is 0, and ID2 is 3. Then, it sets EventID to 1.

I should ensure that these new rules are added before the existing outcome definitions so that they take precedence. Also, I'll add comments to explain each part for clarity.

I'll structure the new code by adding the two new outcome rules with the specific conditions. Then, I'll make sure the rest of the code remains unchanged so that it can still handle other cases as before.

Finally, I'll test the logic to ensure that the new rules correctly override the general outcome rules when the conditions are met. This way, the sequence is set correctly based on the user's instructions.
