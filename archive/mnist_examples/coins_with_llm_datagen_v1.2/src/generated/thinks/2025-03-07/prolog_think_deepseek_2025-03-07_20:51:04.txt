Okay, I need to modify the existing DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand what the current code does.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The happensAt predicate is used to indicate that multiple events occur at the same timestamp. The coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels from each network for the events at a given timestamp. The event_table defines possible combinations of these labels and assigns an EventID. Finally, detectEvent combines these to determine the final event outcome.

Now, the user has added new rules. The first rule is that when the absolute difference between e1 and e2 is 2, the win output is 1; otherwise, it's 0. The second and third rules are conditional based on timestamps and specific label combinations.

I need to incorporate these rules into the code. Let me break it down.

First, I'll add a new predicate, calculate_diff, which computes the absolute difference between ID1 and ID2. This will help determine the win condition.

Next, I'll create a win predicate that uses calculate_diff. If the difference is 2, win is 1; else, 0.

Then, I need to handle the additional rules. The second rule says that between timestamps 50 and 250, if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, the sequence is 0. The third rule states that between 100 and 300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, the sequence is 1.

I'll create a predicate called sequence that takes ID1, ID2, T, and Seq. It will have three conditions: the general win condition, the second rule, and the third rule. Each condition will check the timestamp range and the specific labels, then assign Seq accordingly.

I'll also need to adjust the detectEvent predicate to use the new sequence predicate instead of event_table. So, detectEvent will now call sequence with the IDs and timestamp to get the EventID.

I should ensure that the new predicates are correctly integrated and that all variables are properly passed. Also, I need to follow DeepProblog syntax, avoiding '->' and using '=:=' for equality.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Define calculate_diff to compute the absolute difference.
2. Define win based on calculate_diff.
3. Define sequence with the three conditions.
4. Modify detectEvent to use sequence instead of event_table.

I think that covers all the user's requirements. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to include comments for clarity.
