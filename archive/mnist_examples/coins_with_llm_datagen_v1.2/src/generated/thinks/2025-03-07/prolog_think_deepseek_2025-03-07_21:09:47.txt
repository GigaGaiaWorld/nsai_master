Okay, I need to modify the given DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, event1 and event2, which classify events into different labels. The happensAt predicate combines events happening at the same timestamp, and the coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels for each event. The event_table links these labels to an EventID, which determines the outcome. The detectEvent predicate combines these to produce the final EventID.

Now, the user wants to add new rules. The first condition is that when the absolute difference between event1 and event2's outputs is 2, the result should be win=1; otherwise, win=0. Additionally, there are two more specific rules based on timestamps and event labels.

Let me break down the requirements:

1. The main condition: |e1 - e2| = 2 → win=1, else win=0.
2. Additional rule 1: If timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then the sequence (win) should be 0.
3. Additional rule 2: If timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then win should be 1.

I need to translate these into DeepProblog rules without using if-then syntax. So, I'll create separate clauses for each condition.

First, I'll create a result predicate that captures the win value. The main condition can be split into two cases: when the difference is 2, win is 1, else 0. But since Prolog uses logical predicates, I can write two clauses for result: one where the condition holds and another where it doesn't.

For the additional rules, I'll check the timestamp ranges and specific event labels to set win accordingly. These will override the main condition when their specific conditions are met.

I also need to ensure that the new rules are added correctly without conflicting with the existing code. So, I'll add the new clauses after the existing detectEvent predicate.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Define the result predicate with the main condition.
2. Add the first additional rule for timestamp 50-250, e1=1, e2=3 → win=0.
3. Add the second additional rule for timestamp 100-300, e1=0, e2=3 → win=1.

I should use the correct syntax, using := for equality checks and ensure that all variables are properly bound. Also, I'll use the existing coin1 and coin2 predicates to get the event labels.

Wait, in the existing code, coin1 gives ID1 and T, and coin2 gives ID2 and T. So, in the result clauses, I can use these to get the necessary variables.

Let me structure each clause:

For the main condition:
- Get ID1 and ID2 from coin1 and coin2 for the same T.
- Check if the absolute difference is 2.
- If yes, set win=1; else, win=0.

But since Prolog doesn't support if-then, I'll write two clauses:
- result(win=1, T) when the difference is 2.
- result(win=0, T) otherwise.

But wait, how to handle the otherwise? Maybe using a separate clause that doesn't conflict.

Alternatively, I can write the main condition as two separate rules.

For the additional rules:
- For the first, check if T is between 50 and 250, and ID1=1, ID2=3 → win=0.
- For the second, check if T is between 100 and 300, and ID1=0, ID2=3 → win=1.

I need to make sure that these additional rules take precedence over the main condition when their conditions are met.

So, in the code, I'll write the additional rules first, followed by the main condition.

Wait, in Prolog, the order matters because it uses SLD resolution. So, the more specific rules should come before the general ones. Therefore, I'll place the additional rules before the main condition.

Putting it all together, the result predicate will have four clauses:

1. If T is between 50-250, ID1=1, ID2=3 → win=0.
2. If T is between 100-300, ID1=0, ID2=3 → win=1.
3. If |ID1 - ID2| = 2 → win=1.
4. Else → win=0.

But wait, the main condition is based on the difference, so I need to compute that. In Prolog, I can use abs/2 to get the absolute value.

So, in the third clause, I'll compute the absolute difference and check if it's 2.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to use the correct syntax and variable bindings.
