Okay, I need to modify the given DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the new requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The happensAt predicate is used to indicate that multiple events occur at the same timestamp. The coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels for each event at a given timestamp. The event_table links combinations of these labels to an EventID, which determines the outcome.

The user's instructions add two new rules:

1. When the absolute difference between event1 and event2 outputs is 2, the win output is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
2. Additional rules:
   - If timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, then sequence is 0.
   - If timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, then sequence is 1.

I need to translate these into DeepProblog rules without using if-then syntax. So, I'll create separate clauses for each condition.

First, I'll add a rule for the absolute difference. Since DeepProblog doesn't support if-then, I'll use two clauses: one where the difference is 2 and another where it's not.

Next, I'll handle the timestamp conditions. For each condition, I'll create a rule that checks the timestamp range and the event labels, then sets the sequence accordingly.

I'll also need to ensure that the new predicates are correctly named and that all variables are properly used. I'll add comments to explain each part for clarity.

Putting it all together, I'll write the new rules after the existing code, making sure they follow the correct syntax and logic.
