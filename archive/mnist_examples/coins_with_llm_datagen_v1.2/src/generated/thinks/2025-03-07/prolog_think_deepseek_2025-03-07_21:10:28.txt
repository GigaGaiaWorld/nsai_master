Okay, I need to modify the given DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The happensAt predicate is used to indicate that multiple events occur at the same timestamp. The coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels from each network for the events at a given timestamp. The event_table links combinations of these labels to an EventID, which is then used by detectEvent to determine the final event.

The user wants to add new rules that determine the result as win=1 or 0 based on the difference between event1 and event2 outputs. Specifically, if the absolute difference is 2, win is 1; else, 0. Additionally, there are two special rules based on timestamp ranges and specific label combinations.

First, I'll handle the main rule. The result should be 1 when |ID1 - ID2| is 2. So, I'll create a result predicate that checks this condition using ID1 and ID2 from coin1 and coin2 at the same timestamp.

Next, the additional rules. The first special rule says that between timestamps 50 and 250, if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, the result should be 0. The second rule states that between 100 and 300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, the result should be 1.

I need to structure these rules without using if-then syntax. So, I'll create separate clauses for each condition. For each special case, I'll check the timestamp range and the specific labels, then set the result accordingly.

I also need to ensure that these special rules override the general rule. So, I'll place them before the general rule so that Prolog's execution order will prioritize them.

Putting it all together, I'll add the result predicate with the special cases first, followed by the general case. I'll make sure to use the correct DeepProblog syntax, using =:= for equality and =\= for inequality where necessary.

I should also add comments to explain each part of the code for clarity. This will help anyone reading the code understand the purpose of each rule.

Finally, I'll test the code structure to ensure it's syntactically correct and that all conditions are properly handled without using unsupported syntax like if-then.
