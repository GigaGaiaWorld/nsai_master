Okay, I need to modify the given DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, event1 and event2, which classify events into different labels. The happensAt predicate combines events happening at the same timestamp, and the coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels for each event. The event_table links these labels to an EventID, which determines the outcome. The detectEvent predicate combines these to produce the final EventID at each timestamp.

Now, the user wants to add new rules. The first condition is that when the absolute difference between event1 and event2's outputs is 2, the result should be win=1; otherwise, win=0. Additionally, there are two more specific rules based on timestamps and event labels.

Let me break down the requirements:

1. The main rule: |ID1 - ID2| = 2 → win=1, else win=0.
2. When timestamp is between 50 and 250, and ID1=1, ID2=3 → result=0.
3. When timestamp is between 100 and 300, and ID1=0, ID2=3 → result=1.

I need to translate these into DeepProblog rules without using if-then syntax. So, I'll create separate clauses for each condition.

First, I'll add a result predicate that captures the main rule. Using abs/2 to compute the absolute difference. If the difference is 2, set win=1; else, win=0.

Next, the specific rules. For the first specific rule, I'll check if T is between 50 and 250, and ID1=1, ID2=3. Then, set result=0. Similarly, for the second rule, check T between 100 and 300, ID1=0, ID2=3, and set result=1.

I also need to ensure that these specific rules override the general rule when their conditions are met. So, the specific rules should come before the general rule in the code.

I'll structure the code by first defining the result predicate with the specific conditions, then the general condition. This way, Prolog's execution order will prioritize the specific rules first.

I should also make sure to use the correct syntax, like =:= for equality and compute the absolute difference using abs/2.

Putting it all together, I'll add the new result clauses after the detectEvent predicate, ensuring they correctly reference the necessary variables and conditions.
