Okay, I need to modify the given DeepProblog code based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand the existing code and the new requirements.

The existing code defines two neural networks, mnist_net1 and mnist_net2, which classify events into different labels. The happensAt predicate combines events at the same timestamp, and the coin1 and coin2 predicates extract the labels for each event. The event_table links these labels to an EventID, which determines the outcome.

The user wants to add new rules. The first rule is that when the absolute difference between event1 and event2's labels is 2, the win output is 1; otherwise, it's 0. The second part adds two specific conditions based on timestamps and event labels.

I'll start by creating a new predicate, compute_diff, to calculate the absolute difference. Then, I'll define win conditions based on this difference.

Next, I need to handle the additional rules. For the first condition, when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, the sequence should be 0. I'll create a predicate for this and update the win predicate accordingly.

Similarly, for the second condition, when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, the sequence should be 1. I'll add another predicate and update the win predicate.

I must ensure that the new rules are integrated without using unsupported syntax. I'll use standard logical connections and avoid if-then-else constructs.

Finally, I'll test the logic to make sure all conditions are covered and the win output is correctly determined based on the given rules.
