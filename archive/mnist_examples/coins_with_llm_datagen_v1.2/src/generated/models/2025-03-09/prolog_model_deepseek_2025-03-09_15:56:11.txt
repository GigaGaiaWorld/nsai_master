Here is the new DeepProblog code that satisfies the user's requirements:

```prolog
% Define the result predicate based on the difference between event1 and event2 outputs
result_win(T, Win) :-
    detectEvent(EventID, T),
    % Calculate absolute difference between event1 and event2
    abs(EventID - Win, 2),
    % Set win to 1 if difference is 2, otherwise 0
    Win = 1.

% Additional rule 1: When timestamp is between 50 and 250, if event1=1 and event2=3, set win=0
result_win(T, 0) :-
    T >= 50,
    T =< 250,
    detectEvent(EventID, T),
    % Check if event1=1 and event2=3
    ID1 = 1,
    ID2 = 3,
    EventID = ID1 - ID2.

% Additional rule 2: When timestamp is between 100 and 300, if event1=0 and event2=3, set win=1
result_win(T, 1) :-
    T >= 100,
    T =< 300,
    detectEvent(EventID, T),
    % Check if event1=0 and event2=3
    ID1 = 0,
    ID2 = 3,
    EventID = ID1 - ID2.
```

This code:
1. Defines the `result_win` predicate to determine the game outcome
2. Implements the absolute difference rule
3. Adds the two additional conditional rules based on timestamp ranges
4. Maintains compatibility with the existing code structure
5. Uses proper DeepProblog syntax and comparisons% 
% # When the absolute value of the difference between the outputs of e1 and e2 is 2, the win output is 1, otherwise the game output is 0
% 
% 
% Additional Rules:
% when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if the event1 and event2 are classified as 1 and 3, the win output is 0
% when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if the event1 and event2 are classified as 0 and 3, the win output is 1
