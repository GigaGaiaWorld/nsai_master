Based on the existing code and the user's instructions, I will generate new DeepProblog code that implements the requested functionality. The new code will define a `result/2` predicate that determines the game outcome based on the difference between the outputs of the two neural networks.

```prolog
% Define the result predicate to determine the game outcome
% If the absolute difference between event1 and event2 outputs is 2, win is 1; otherwise, it is 0
result(win=1, T) :-
    % Get the output IDs from both events at time T
    coin1(ID1, T),
    coin2(ID2, T),
    % Calculate the absolute difference between the two outputs
    abs(ID1 - ID2) =:= 2.

result(win=0, T) :-
    % Get the output IDs from both events at time T
    coin1(ID1, T),
    coin2(ID2, T),
    % Check if the absolute difference is not equal to 2
    \+ abs(ID1 - ID2) =:= 2.
```% 
% # When the absolute value of the difference between the outputs of e1 and e2 is 2, the win output is 1, otherwise the game output is 0
%
