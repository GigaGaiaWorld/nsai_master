The code has been modified to directly compute the result based on the absolute difference between the two event outputs without using an intermediate outcome predicate.

```prolog
nn(mnist_net1,[X],Y,[0,1]) :: event1(X,Y).
nn(mnist_net2,[X],Y,[2,3]) :: event2(X,Y).

coin1(ID1, T) :-
    happensAt(X,Y,T), 
    event1(X, ID1).
coin2(ID2, T) :-
    happensAt(X,Y,T), 
    event2(Y, ID2).

result(win=1, T) :-
    coin1(ID1, T),
    coin2(ID2, T),
    abs(ID1 - ID2) =:= 2.

result(win=0, T) :-
    coin1(ID1, T),
    coin2(ID2, T),
    \+ (abs(ID1 - ID2) =:= 2).
```% 
% When the absolute value of the difference between the outputs of e1 and e2 is 2, the game output is 1, otherwise the game output is 0
