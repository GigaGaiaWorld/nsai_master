% Predicate to check specific conditions for outcome
% Args: Timestamp, ID1, ID2, EventID
% Determines the sequence outcome based on specific conditions
condition_outcome(T, ID1, ID2, 0) :-
    T >= 50,
    T <= 250,
    ID1 = 1,
    ID2 = 3.

condition_outcome(T, ID1, ID2, 1) :-
    T >= 100,
    T <= 300,
    ID1 = 0,
    ID2 = 3.

% Modified detectEvent predicate to include the new conditions
