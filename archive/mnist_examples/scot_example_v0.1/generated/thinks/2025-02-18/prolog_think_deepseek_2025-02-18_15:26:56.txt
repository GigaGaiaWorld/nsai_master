Okay, I need to translate the given three conditions into Prolog predicates using the provided structure. Let me go through each condition one by one.

First condition: When the temperature exceeds 26Â°C and the server CPU utilization exceeds 75%, there's a risk of overheating. So, I need to create an event for each part. For temperature, I'll check if the mean is above 26. For CPU, I'll check if the mean is above 0.75. Then, the anomaly will trigger if both events occur.

Second condition: When the average temperature is below 24 and average humidity is above 0.85, risk of condensation. So, I'll create events for low temperature and high humidity, then combine them for the anomaly.

Third condition: The difference between weather and room temperature is too large, risking high power consumption. I'll create an event that checks the absolute difference between the two temperatures and set a threshold, say 2.0. Then, the anomaly triggers if this event is true.

I need to make sure each event is correctly defined with the right sensors and thresholds, and then combine them appropriately in the anomaly predicates.
