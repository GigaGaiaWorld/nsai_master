Okay, I need to translate the given three conditions into Prolog predicates using the provided structure. Let me go through each condition one by one.

First condition: When the temperature exceeds 26Â°C and the server CPU utilization exceeds 75%, there's a risk of overheating. So, I need to create an event for each part. For temperature, I'll create event_temperature_exceed(Sensor, 26). For CPU, since it's 75%, I'll make event_cpu_high_utilization(Sensor, 0.75). Then, the anomaly predicate combines both events.

Second condition: Average temperature below 24 and humidity above 0.85. So, event_temperature_below(Sensor, 24) and event_humidity_exceed(Sensor, 0.85). The anomaly combines these two.

Third condition: The difference between weather and room temperature is large. I'll create event_temperature_difference_large(Sensor1, Sensor2) and set the threshold to 2.0. The anomaly uses this event.

I need to make sure each event and anomaly follows the correct structure, using the sensor_data predicates with the right parameters. Also, ensure that the variables are correctly referenced and the thresholds are properly applied.

I should also check if the sensor IDs are correctly assigned. For example, sensor_KMS1 for room temperature and sensor_weather for weather data. Similarly, sensor_cpu for CPU load.

Now, I'll structure each event and anomaly step by step, making sure the syntax is correct and all necessary parameters are included. I'll also ensure that the mean values are compared against the thresholds and that the differences are calculated using abs() where necessary.

Finally, I'll compile all the predicates together, ensuring there are no syntax errors and that each part is correctly linked.
