Okay, I need to translate the given natural language event descriptions into formal logic-based anomaly detection rules using the specified structure. Let me break down each of the three points and figure out how to model them.

Starting with the first point: "When the temperature exceeds 26°C and the server CPU utilization exceeds 75%, there is a risk of overheat." So, I need to create an event for each condition and then an anomaly that combines them.

For the temperature exceeding 26°C, I'll create an event called temperature_exceed. It will check if the mean temperature from a sensor is above 26. Then, for the CPU utilization, I'll create cpu_high_utilization, checking if the mean CPU load is over 0.75. The anomaly overheat_risk will trigger if both events are true.

Moving to the second point: "When the average temperature is below 24 degrees and the average humidity is above 0.85, there is a risk of condensation." I'll create two events here. temperature_low checks if the mean temperature is below 24, and humidity_high checks if the mean humidity exceeds 0.85. The anomaly condensation_risk will be true if both events occur.

The third point is about the temperature difference between weather and room being too large, indicating high power consumption. I'll create an event temperature_difference_large that checks if the absolute difference in mean temperatures between two sensors exceeds a threshold, say 2.0. The anomaly high_power_consumption will trigger if this event is true.

I need to make sure each event and anomaly is correctly structured with the right predicates and variables. Also, I should use the correct sensor IDs and items, like sensor_KMS1 for temperature and sensor_cpu for CPU load, and sensor_weather for humidity.

Let me double-check the syntax to ensure everything is correctly formatted. Each event should have the necessary sensor_data predicates with the appropriate variables, and the anomalies should combine the relevant events.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write out the Prolog code accordingly.
