Okay, I need to help the user by translating their event descriptions into formal logic-based anomaly detection rules using the given structure. Let me start by understanding each event description and mapping them to the correct predicates.

First, the user provided three event descriptions:

1. When wind speed rises and temperature drops, there's a risk of catching a cold.
2. When wind speed drops and temperature rises, and the temperature is higher than 9, there's a risk of dryness.
3. When wind speed is lower than 3.6, there's a risk of stillness.

I need to create event predicates for each condition and then define the anomaly predicates based on these events.

Starting with the first event: wind speed rising and temperature dropping. I'll create an event called wind_speed_rise_and_temperature_drop. This event will check if the wind speed's slope is positive (rising) and the temperature's slope is negative (dropping). So, I'll write two sensor_data predicates for wind_speed and temperature, checking their slopes.

Next, the second event: wind speed drops, temperature rises, and temperature is above 9. The event name will be wind_speed_drop_and_temperature_rise. I'll check the slopes for wind_speed (slope < 0) and temperature (slope > 0), and also ensure the mean temperature is greater than 9.

The third event is when wind speed is below 3.6. The event is wind_speed_low, so I'll check if the mean wind_speed is less than 3.6.

Now, for the anomaly predicates. Each event corresponds to a risk, so I'll create an anomaly for each. 

- For the first event, the anomaly is cold_risk, which occurs when wind_speed_rise_and_temperature_drop happens for a specific sensor.
- The second event leads to dryness_risk, so the anomaly is when wind_speed_drop_and_temperature_rise is true for the sensor.
- The third event is stillness_risk, triggered when wind_speed_low is true.

I need to make sure each predicate is correctly structured, using the sensor_data facts with the appropriate items (wind_speed and temperature) and the correct conditions on mean values and slopes.

I should also ensure that the variable names are consistent and that each predicate is properly defined without any syntax errors. Each event and anomaly should be a separate clause in Prolog syntax.

Finally, I'll review each predicate to make sure they accurately reflect the event descriptions and that all conditions are correctly implemented.
