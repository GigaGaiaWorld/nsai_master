Okay, I need to help the user by translating their event descriptions into formal logic-based anomaly detection rules using the given structure. Let me start by understanding each event description and mapping them to the correct predicates.

First, the user provided three event descriptions. I'll take each one step by step.

1. **Event 1:** When wind speed rises and temperature drops, there's a risk of catching a cold. So, I need to create an event that captures both conditions. The event name could be "cold_risk". I'll need two predicates: one for wind speed rising and another for temperature dropping. Each will check the slope of their respective sensors. Then, the anomaly will trigger if both events occur together.

2. **Event 2:** When wind speed drops and temperature rises, and the temperature is higher than 9, there's a risk of dryness. The event name here would be "dryness_risk". I'll create two events: one for wind speed dropping and another for temperature rising. The temperature rising event should also check if the mean temperature exceeds 9. The anomaly will combine these two events.

3. **Event 3:** When wind speed is lower than 3.6, there's a risk of stillness. The event name is "stillness_risk". This only requires a single condition on the wind speed's mean value. The anomaly will directly trigger this event.

Now, I'll structure each event and the corresponding anomaly predicate according to the examples provided. I'll make sure to use the correct sensor_data predicates and combine the events appropriately using logical conjunctions.

I should also ensure that the variable names are consistent and that each event is properly defined before being used in the anomaly predicate. Each event will have its own rule, and the anomaly will combine the relevant events.

Finally, I'll review each rule to make sure it accurately reflects the conditions described and that the syntax is correct for execution.
