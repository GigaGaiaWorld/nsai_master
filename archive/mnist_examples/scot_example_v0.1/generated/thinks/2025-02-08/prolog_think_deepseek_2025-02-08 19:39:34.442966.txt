Okay, I need to help the user by translating their event descriptions into formal logic-based anomaly detection rules using the given structure. Let me start by understanding each event description and mapping them to the correct predicates.

First, the user provided three event descriptions:

1. When wind speed rises and temperature drops, there's a risk of catching a cold.
2. When wind speed drops and temperature rises, and the temperature is higher than 9, there's a risk of dryness.
3. When wind speed is lower than 3.6, there's a risk of stillness.

I need to create event predicates for each condition and then define the anomaly predicates based on these events.

Starting with the first event: wind speed rising and temperature dropping. I'll create two event predicates, one for wind speed rise and another for temperature drop. Then, the anomaly predicate will combine these two events.

For the second event: wind speed dropping, temperature rising, and temperature above 9. I'll create predicates for wind speed drop and temperature rise, then combine them with the temperature threshold in the anomaly.

The third event is straightforwardâ€”wind speed below 3.6. So, I'll create a single event predicate for this condition and set the anomaly directly based on it.

I need to ensure that each sensor_data fact is correctly referenced with the right sensor IDs and items. For example, sensor_weather is used for windspeed and temperature, and sensor_KMS1 for temperature.

I should also make sure that the variable names are consistent and that the conditions are correctly combined using logical operators like '>', '<', and 'abs' where necessary.

Finally, I'll structure each event and anomaly predicate according to the examples provided, ensuring that the syntax is correct and that each rule is properly formatted.
