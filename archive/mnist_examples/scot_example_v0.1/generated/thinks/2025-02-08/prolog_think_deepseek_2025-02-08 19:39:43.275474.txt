Okay, I need to translate the given natural language event descriptions into formalized logic-based anomaly detection rules using the provided structure. Let me break down each event and construct the appropriate predicates.

First, looking at the three events:

1. When wind speed rises and temperature drops, there's a risk of catching a cold.
2. When wind speed drops and temperature rises, and the temperature is higher than 9, there's a risk of dryness.
3. When wind speed is lower than 3.6, there's a risk of stillness.

I'll start by defining each event as a separate predicate.

For the first event, I need to check if wind speed is rising (slope > 0) and temperature is dropping (slope < 0). So, I'll create event_cold_risk(Sensor) where Sensor monitors both windspeed and temperature.

The second event requires wind speed to drop (slope < 0), temperature to rise (slope > 0), and the mean temperature to be above 9. So, event_dryness_risk(Sensor) will check these conditions.

The third event is straightforward: if wind speed's mean is below 3.6, then event_stillness_risk(Sensor) is true.

Now, I'll define each event predicate with the appropriate conditions using the sensor_data facts. After defining the events, I'll create the anomaly predicates that map to these events.

Each anomaly will be a single fact corresponding to each event. So, anomaly(cold_risk) will depend on event_cold_risk, anomaly(dryness_risk) on event_dryness_risk, and anomaly(stillness_risk) on event_stillness_risk.

I need to ensure that the sensor used in each event can monitor both windspeed and temperature where necessary. Also, I'll use the correct variable names and operators as per the examples provided.

Finally, I'll structure each predicate correctly, making sure the syntax is right and all variables are properly used. I'll test each predicate to ensure it accurately reflects the conditions described in the events.
