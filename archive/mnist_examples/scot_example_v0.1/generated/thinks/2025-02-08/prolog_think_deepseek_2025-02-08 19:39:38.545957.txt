Okay, I need to translate the given natural language event descriptions into formalized logic-based anomaly detection rules using the provided structure. Let me break down each event and construct the appropriate predicates.

First, looking at the three events:

1. When wind speed rises and temperature drops, there's a risk of catching a cold.
2. When wind speed drops and temperature rises, and the temperature is higher than 9, there's a risk of dryness.
3. When wind speed is lower than 3.6, there's a risk of stillness.

I'll start by defining each event as a separate predicate.

For the first event, I need to create event_cold_risk. It involves two sensors: one for wind speed and another for temperature. The conditions are that wind speed's slope is positive (rising) and temperature's slope is negative (dropping). So, I'll write a predicate that checks these slope conditions.

Next, the second event is event_dryness_risk. Here, wind speed is dropping (slope < 0), temperature is rising (slope > 0), and the mean temperature is above 9. I'll structure this predicate to include all these conditions.

The third event is event_stillness_risk. This is simpler as it only involves the wind speed being below 3.6. The predicate will check if the mean wind speed is less than 3.6.

After defining these events, I need to create the anomaly predicates. Each anomaly corresponds to one of these events. So, I'll define three anomalies: cold_risk, dryness_risk, and stillness_risk. Each anomaly will call the respective event predicate.

I should ensure that the sensor variables are correctly referenced and that all conditions are accurately translated into the predicates. Also, I need to make sure that the variable names and sensor IDs are correctly used in the sensor_data facts.

Finally, I'll review each predicate to ensure they follow the structure provided in the examples and that all conditions are properly captured without any additional descriptive content.
