# Problem Context:

[[CONTEXT]]

# Facts:

### There are two different types of facts write as predicates: "happensAt" and "event". Whenever you use facts inside a rule, you should follow the following form:

1\. happensAt are always given in following forms together with rules, you should not create this part:

 happensAt(Event1, Event2, ...,Event-n, Timestamp).

 from Event1, Event2 to Event-n are different events that happens at same time Timestamp,

 for example:

 happensAt(boy, alien, 12). means there's two events(boy and alien) happens at timestamp 12.

2\. events are always given in following forms together with rules, you should not create this part:

 event<Event_name>(Event, Label).

 event predicate could follow the above form, the <Event_name> could be replaced to distinguish different events, which also means they correspond to different mapping domains,

 for example:

 event1(14243, 2). could have one of the Label1 from [0,1,2,3], means event 14243 will be classified as class 2.

 event2(dog, black). could have one of the Label2 from [black,white], means event dog will be classified as class black.

# Task:

### Your task is to generate new DeepProblog code based on the following existing DeepProblog code and the user's instructions. Please first analyze the structure and logic of the existing code, and then create additional code according to the user's instructions so that it conforms to the DeepProblog syntax. Please add necessary comments in the code to explain the function of each part. As a supplement to the existing code, the new code should be compatible with the existing code in terms of content, but it cannot make any modifications to the existing code.

### The existing DeepProblog code that you should refer to is below:

[[RULE_SET]]

### Here are some examples of facts, other facts also follows the same form:

[[FACTS]]

### Here are some examples of queries, other queries also follows the same form:

[[QUERIES]]

### Below is the demand of user that you need to fullfill with your generated new code:

[[QUESTION]]
