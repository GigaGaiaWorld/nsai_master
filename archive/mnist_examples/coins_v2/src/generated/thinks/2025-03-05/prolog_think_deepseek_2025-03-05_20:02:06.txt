Okay, I need to solve this problem by modifying the existing Problog code according to the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding the problem context and the existing code.

The existing code combines outputs from two neural networks, event1 and event2. It uses logical rules to determine the final event outcome based on the difference between the two event labels. The key predicates are happensAt, event1, event2, coin1, coin2, outcome, and detectEvent.

The user's new requirements are:
1. When the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, the sequence should be 0.
2. When the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, the sequence should be 1.

I need to incorporate these new rules into the existing code.

First, I'll look at the existing outcome predicate. It currently checks if the absolute difference between ID1 and ID2 is 2. The new rules are more specific, involving both the timestamp range and specific ID values.

I'll need to create new outcome predicates that handle these specific cases. I'll name them outcome1 and outcome2 for clarity. Each will check the timestamp range and the specific ID values, then set the sequence accordingly.

For outcome1:
- Check if T is between 50 and 250 (inclusive).
- Check if ID1 is 1 and ID2 is 3.
- If both conditions are met, set sequence to 0.

For outcome2:
- Check if T is between 100 and 300 (inclusive).
- Check if ID1 is 0 and ID2 is 3.
- If both conditions are met, set sequence to 1.

I should also ensure that these new rules don't conflict with the existing outcome rules. Since the existing rules are more general, the new specific rules should take precedence. Prolog's execution order is top-down, so placing the new rules before the general ones might be necessary, but in this case, since the conditions are specific, they should trigger correctly when the conditions are met.

Next, I'll add the new outcome predicates to the code. I'll write them with clear comments explaining each condition.

Now, I'll test the logic with the provided examples. For instance, when T is 0, it's not within 50-250 or 100-300, so the general outcome rules apply. When T is 3, it falls within both new ranges, so if ID1 and ID2 match the specified values, the sequence is set accordingly.

I also need to make sure that the detectEvent predicate correctly uses these new outcome rules. Since the new rules are added, the detectEvent will automatically use them when the conditions are met.

Finally, I'll ensure that the code is properly formatted and that all necessary periods and commas are in place to avoid syntax errors.
