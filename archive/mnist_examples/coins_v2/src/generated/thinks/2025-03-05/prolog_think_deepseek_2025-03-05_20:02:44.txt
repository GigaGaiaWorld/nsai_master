Okay, I need to solve this problem by modifying the existing Problog code according to the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding the problem context and the existing code.

The existing code combines outputs from two neural networks, event1 and event2. It uses logical rules to determine the final event outcome based on the difference between the two event labels. The key predicates are happensAt, event1, event2, coin1, coin2, outcome, and detectEvent.

The user's new requirements are:
1. When the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if event1 is 1 and event2 is 3, the sequence should be 0.
2. When the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if event1 is 0 and event2 is 3, the sequence should be 1.

I need to incorporate these new rules into the existing code.

First, I'll look at the existing outcome predicate. It currently checks if the absolute difference between ID1 and ID2 is 2. The new rules are more specific, involving both the timestamp range and specific event labels.

I'll need to create new outcome predicates that handle these specific cases. I'll name them outcome1 and outcome2 for clarity. Each will check the timestamp range and the specific event labels, then set the sequence accordingly.

Next, I'll modify the detectEvent predicate to use these new outcome predicates. It should first check if either outcome1 or outcome2 conditions are met; otherwise, it should fall back to the original outcome check.

I also need to ensure that the new rules are added correctly without disrupting the existing logic. I'll add comments to explain each part for clarity.

Now, I'll structure the new code. I'll define outcome1 and outcome2 with the specific conditions. Then, in detectEvent, I'll first check if either outcome1 or outcome2 is true. If not, it will use the original outcome check.

I should also make sure that the timestamp is an integer and within the specified ranges. Using clamp/3 will help ensure T is within the correct range for each condition.

Finally, I'll test the logic to ensure that the new rules are correctly applied and that the sequence is set as required.
