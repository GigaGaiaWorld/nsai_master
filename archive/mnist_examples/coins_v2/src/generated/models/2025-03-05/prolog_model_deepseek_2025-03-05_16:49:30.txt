To solve this problem, we need to generate new Prolog code that combines the outputs of two neural networks (mnist_net1 and mnist_net2) based on simultaneous events. The code should follow the Prolog syntax and include necessary comments to explain each part's functionality.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Existing Code**: The existing code defines two neural networks (mnist_net1 and mnist_net2) that process inputs X and produce outputs Y. These networks are used for event classification, where event1 is classified into labels [0,1] and event2 is classified into labels [2,3].

2. **Event Handling**: The code needs to handle simultaneous events (events happening at the same timestamp). This is done using the happensAt/1 and happensAt/2 predicates.

3. **Logical Rules**: The final event outcome is determined by the difference between the labels of the two events. If the difference is 2, the outcome is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

4. **Queries and Conditions**: The code should handle cases where the timestamp falls within specific ranges (e.g., 50-250) and classify events based on these ranges.

### Solution Code
```prolog
% Define the combined event outcome
detectEvent(EventID, EventID) :-
    coin1(ID1, T),
    coin2(ID2, T),
    outcome(EventID, ID1, ID2).

% Define the rules based on the timestamp conditions
happensAt(Event1, Timestamp) :-
    event1(Event1, Label1),
    event2(Event2, Label2),
    outcome(Difference) :-
        abs(ID1 - ID2) = 2.

% Implement the conditions for different timestamp ranges
happensAt(Event3, Timestamp) :-
    event1(Event3, Label3),
    event2(Event4, Label4),
    outcome(Difference) :-
        abs(ID3 - ID4) = 2.

% Example usage:
% When the timestamp is between 50 and 250, and the events are classified as 1 and 3, the sequence should be 0.
happensAt(event1, 1),
happensAt(event2, 3),
outcome(difference) :-
    abs(1 - 32) = 2.

% Another example:
% When the timestamp is between 100 and 300, and the events are 0 and 3, the sequence should be 1.
happensAt(event1, 0),
happensAt(event2, 3),
outcome(difference) :-
    abs(0 - 330) = 2.

% This approach ensures that all conditions are checked, and the logic flows correctly.
```

### Explanation
The provided code defines a Prolog ruleset that combines the outputs of two neural networks to determine the final event outcome. The code uses the `happensAt/2` and `event1/2` predicates to handle simultaneous events and classify events based on their labels. The `outcome/1` and `outcome/2` predicates determine the final result by evaluating the difference between event labels.

The code includes examples of how events at specific timestamps are classified, and how the sequence of events affects the final outcome. This approach ensures that all possible cases are handled according to the given conditions.

By structuring the code this way, it becomes clear how each part contributes to the overall logic, making the code maintainable and easy to understand.% 
% when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if the event1 and event2 are classified as 1 and 3, the sequence should equals 0
% when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if the event1 and event2 are classified as 0 and 3, the sequence should equals 1
