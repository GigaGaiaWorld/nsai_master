Here is the new Prolog code that satisfies the user's requirements:

```prolog
% New rules for determining the sequence based on specific conditions
detectEvent(sequence=0, T) :-
    % When timestamp is between 50 and 250, and event1=1, event2=3
    coin1(1, T),
    coin2(3, T),
    T >= 50,
    T =< 250.

detectEvent(sequence=1, T) :-
    % When timestamp is between 100 and 300, and event1=0, event2=3
    coin1(0, T),
    coin2(3, T),
    T >= 100,
    T =< 300.
```

This code adds two new clauses to the `detectEvent` predicate that handle the specific conditions specified by the user. The existing code remains unchanged and continues to handle general cases through the `outcome` predicate.% 
% when the timestamp is between 50 and 250, if the event1 and event2 are classified as 1 and 3, the sequence should equals 0
% when the timestamp is between 100 and 300, if the event1 and event2 are classified as 0 and 3, the sequence should equals 1
