Based on the user's requirements and the context provided, I'll generate the code for each `[[LANGDA]]` placeholder. Here are the completed code blocks:

```prolog
% Simple answer predicate
langda(ans).
```

```prolog
% Why predicate with neural network definition
langda(why) :-
    mlp(_, why, [1,2,3,4,5,6]).
```

```prolog
% Unknown variable predicate
langda(X).
```

```prolog
% Valid drone flight with neural networks and LLM information
valid_drone_flight(X) :-
    (langda(X,T), vlos(X));
    (can_return(X));
    langda(T).

langda(Return, Unknown) :-
    mnist_net1(_, 0),
    mnist_net2(_, 2),
    % LLM information: there's a high building at: (100,200)
    building_at(100,200).

langda(anstimewer).
```

```prolog
% Coin win predicate with complex conditions
coin_win() :-
    langda(return, time),
    permits(return),
    langda(return, fun, darmstadt).

langda(return, time) :-
    mnist_net1(_, 1),
    mnist_net2(_, 3),
    % LLM information: If the code difference is 2, it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.
    (code_diff(2) -> returns(1); returns(0)).

langda(return, fun, darmstadt) :-
    position_net(there, here),
    audio(dog, child, horn),
    % LLM information: If the we is 2, and horn is there, we eat banana.
    (we(2), horn(there) -> eat(banana).
```

Each code block maintains consistency with the original DeepProblog syntax and includes the required neural network definitions and LLM information as specified in the user's requirements. The comments explain the purpose of each part of the code.
