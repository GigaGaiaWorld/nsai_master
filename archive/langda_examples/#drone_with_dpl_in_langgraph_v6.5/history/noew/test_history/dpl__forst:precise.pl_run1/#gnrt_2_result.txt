Here's the extracted and formatted code block corresponding to the <langda> block in the <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "E659D458", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])."}
```

Note: The <langda> block in the original code only specified the requirements for the `push` operation, which was already complete in both the original and generated code. The other operations (pop, dup, swap, over, rot, sort) were either already complete in the original code or weren't referenced by any <langda> blocks, so they weren't included in the final answer.
