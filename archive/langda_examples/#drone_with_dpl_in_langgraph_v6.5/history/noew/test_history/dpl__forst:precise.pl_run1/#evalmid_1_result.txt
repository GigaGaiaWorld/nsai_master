<Overall_Analysis>
The provided code implements a stack with various operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`). The test results show that all operations except `sort` work correctly. The `sort` operation is partially implemented but contains logical issues due to the use of unsupported `if-then-else` constructs in ProbLog. The overall code quality is good for the supported operations, but the `sort` operation needs revision to comply with ProbLog's syntax constraints.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Test Failures**: The `sort` operation is not tested in the provided results, but its implementation is flawed due to the use of `if-then-else` constructs (`->`), which are not supported in ProbLog.
2. **Root Cause**: The `sort3` predicate uses unsupported `if-then-else` logic to determine the middle element (`Y`) of the sorted list. ProbLog does not support imperative control constructs like `->` and requires declarative alternatives.
3. **Structural Issue**: The `sort` operation assumes the stack has at least 3 elements, but the code does not handle cases where the stack has fewer elements, which could lead to runtime errors.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace `if-then-else` with Declarative Logic**: Rewrite the `sort3` predicate using supported ProbLog constructs like `min_list`, `max_list`, and logical disjunctions (`;`). For example:
   ```prolog
   sort3(A, B, C, [X, Y, Z]) :-
       min_list([A, B, C], X),
       max_list([A, B, C], Z),
       (X =:= A, Z =:= B, Y = C;
        X =:= A, Z =:= C, Y = B;
        X =:= B, Z =:= A, Y = C;
        X =:= B, Z =:= C, Y = A;
        X =:= C, Z =:= A, Y = B;
        X =:= C, Z =:= B, Y = A).
   ```
2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Add a check in the `sort` operation to ensure the stack has at least 3 elements before sorting. For example:
   ```prolog
   stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-
       length(Stack, L),
       (L >= 3 ->
           get_top_n(Stack, 3, [A, B, C], Rest),
           sort3(A, B, C, SortedElements),
           append(SortedElements, Rest, SortedStack)
       ; SortedStack = Stack).
   ```
   Note: Replace `->` with a supported alternative like `(L >= 3, Action) ; (L < 3, Alternative)`.
3. **Test the `sort` Operation**: Add test cases for the `sort` operation to verify its correctness, including edge cases (e.g., stacks with fewer than 3 elements).
