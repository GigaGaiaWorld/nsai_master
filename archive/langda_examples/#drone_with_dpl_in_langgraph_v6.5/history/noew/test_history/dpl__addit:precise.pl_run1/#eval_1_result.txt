The predicate correctly implements the required logic for converting image lists to numbers.","SuggestedFix": "None needed for this module. However, ensure the base case `number([], Result, Result).` is included in the overall code.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}

```report
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","ErrorSummary": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is incomplete in the surrounding context but correctly implements the required logic for addition.","SuggestedFix": "Complete the surrounding context of `multi_addition/3` by adding the missing predicates and documentation. For example, ensure `number/2` is defined and add comments explaining the logic.","Dependencies": ["6579E7BA"],"NeedRegenerate": true}
