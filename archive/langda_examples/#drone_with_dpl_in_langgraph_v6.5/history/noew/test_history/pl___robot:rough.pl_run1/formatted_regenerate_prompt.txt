<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Resultï¼š
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5834
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3700
</Result>
<Analysis>
<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The test results indicate that the robot successfully carries the key with a probability of 0.5834 and is at `loc2` with a probability of 0.9000. However, the probabilities for the key's location (`loc2` = 0.5670, `loc1` = 0.3700) suggest some logical inconsistencies or inefficiencies in the code. The overall structure adheres to ProbLog's syntax and semantics, but the negation-as-failure usage and probabilistic dependencies could be refined for better accuracy.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Negation-as-Failure Usage**:
   - The code uses `\+` (negation-as-failure) in predicates like `drops(key,T)` and `at(key,Pos,s(T))`. While syntactically correct, the logic may not fully align with the intended behavior, especially in probabilistic contexts. For example, the predicate `drops(key,T)` relies on `\+ slippery(key,T)`, which might not account for all edge cases.

2. **Probabilistic Dependencies**:
   - The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds(T)` (0.7) and `retains_key(T)` (0.8) seem reasonable, but the interaction between these events and the negation-based predicates could lead to unintended results. For instance, the probability of `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` being 0.5834 suggests that the combined probabilities might not reflect the intended scenario accurately.

3. **Logical Inconsistencies**:
   - The test results show non-zero probabilities for the key being at both `loc1` and `loc2` at time `s(s(s(0)))`. This suggests that the rules for `at(key,Pos,T)` and `carrying(key,T)` might not fully exclude each other, leading to overlapping possibilities.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Refine Negation-as-Failure**:
   - Ensure that negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used only for ground goals (where all variables are instantiated). For example, in `drops(key,T)`, add a check to ensure `slippery(key,T)` is ground before negation.
   - Replace `\+` with explicit probabilistic conditions where possible. For example, instead of `\+ slippery(key,T)`, use `0.5::slippery(key,T)` to model uncertainty explicitly.

2. **Clarify Probabilistic Dependencies**:
   - Review the interaction between `pickup_succeeds(T)`, `retains_key(T)`, and `drops(key,T)` to ensure the probabilities align with the intended behavior. For example, adjust the probabilities or add intermediate predicates to better model the dependencies.

3. **Eliminate Logical Overlaps**:
   - Modify the rules for `at(key,Pos,T)` and `carrying(key,T)` to ensure mutual exclusivity. For example, add a condition to `at(key,Pos,T)` that explicitly checks `\+ carrying(key,T)` when the key is not being carried.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Add more test cases to validate edge cases, such as when the key is slippery or when the robot fails to pick it up. This will help identify and fix any remaining inconsistencies.

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>
</Regenerate_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed code here

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
