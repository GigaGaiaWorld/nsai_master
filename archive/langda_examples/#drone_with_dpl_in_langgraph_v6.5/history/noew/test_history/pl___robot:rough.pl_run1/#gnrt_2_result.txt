Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, there is one <Langda> block in the origin_code that corresponds to a completed code block in the generated_code. Here's the extracted and formatted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "D92532A0", "Code": "at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-\n    goto_succeeds(T),\n    do(goto(Pos), T)."}
```

This is the only code block that was added to complete the <Langda> section in the origin_code. The rest of the code remained unchanged between the origin and generated versions.
