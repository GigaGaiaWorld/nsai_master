### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, such as actuator selection and wind effects. The test results show that the system successfully reaches the goal (`goal_reached`) with decreasing probabilities over time, while `overrun_exception` occurrences are minimal but non-zero. The code adheres to the requirements, but the decreasing probability of reaching the goal suggests potential inefficiencies or logical gaps in the control logic.

### Error Summary
1. **Decreasing Probability of `goal_reached`**:
   - The probability of `goal_reached` decreases over time (from 0.2625 at T=1 to 0.0570 at T=5). This suggests that the system becomes less effective at reaching the goal as time progresses, possibly due to the cumulative effect of wind or actuator inefficiencies.

2. **Non-Zero `overrun_exception`**:
   - The `overrun_exception` occurs at T=2 onwards, indicating that the flap position occasionally exceeds the legal range. This is expected due to the probabilistic nature of the wind and actuator selection, but the increasing trend (peaking at T=4) suggests a need for better control logic.

3. **Potential Logical Gaps**:
   - The `attempted_flap_position` rule does not account for cases where the actuator strength or wind effect might push the flap beyond the legal range in a single step. This could explain the `overrun_exception` occurrences.

### Recommendations
1. **Refine the `attempted_flap_position` Rule**:
   - Add constraints to ensure the calculated `Pos` (new flap position) remains within the legal range (0-10) before accepting it. For example:
     ```prolog
     attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
         Time > 0,
         Prev is Time-1,
         flap_position(Prev, Old),
         \+ goal(Old),
         use_actuator(Time, A),
         actuator_strength(A, AS),
         goal(GP),
         AE is sign(GP-Old)*AS,
         wind_effect(Time, WE),
         TempPos is Old + AE + WE,
         (legal_flap_position(TempPos) -> Pos = TempPos ; Pos = Old).
     ```
   - This ensures the flap position never exceeds the legal range.

2. **Optimize Actuator Selection**:
   - The current actuator selection is random (50-50). Consider biasing the selection toward the stronger actuator (`a`) to improve the probability of reaching the goal.

3. **Adjust Wind Effect Probabilities**:
   - The wind effects are currently symmetric. If the goal is to move the flap left (from 6 to 4), consider adjusting the wind probabilities to favor leftward movement (e.g., higher probability for negative wind effects).

4. **Add Debugging Queries**:
   - Include queries to track intermediate states (e.g., `flap_position`, `wind_effect`) to better understand the system's behavior and identify bottlenecks.

5. **Validate with More Test Cases**:
   - Test the system with different initial positions and goals to ensure robustness.

By implementing these changes, the system should achieve higher probabilities of `goal_reached` and minimize `overrun_exception` occurrences.
