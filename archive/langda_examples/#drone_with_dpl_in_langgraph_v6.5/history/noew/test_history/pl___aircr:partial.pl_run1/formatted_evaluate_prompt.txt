<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, such as actuator selection and wind effects. The test results show that the system successfully reaches the goal (`goal_reached`) with decreasing probabilities over time, while `overrun_exception` occurrences are minimal but non-zero. The code adheres to the requirements, but the decreasing probability of reaching the goal suggests potential inefficiencies or logical gaps in the control logic.

### Error Summary
1. **Decreasing Probability of `goal_reached`**:
   - The probability of `goal_reached` decreases over time (from 0.2625 at T=1 to 0.0570 at T=5). This suggests that the system becomes less effective at reaching the goal as time progresses, possibly due to the cumulative effect of wind or actuator inefficiencies.

2. **Non-Zero `overrun_exception`**:
   - The `overrun_exception` occurs at T=2 onwards, indicating that the flap position occasionally exceeds the legal range. This is expected due to the probabilistic nature of the wind and actuator selection, but the increasing trend (peaking at T=4) suggests a need for better control logic.

3. **Potential Logical Gaps**:
   - The `attempted_flap_position` rule does not account for cases where the actuator strength or wind effect might push the flap beyond the legal range in a single step. This could explain the `overrun_exception` occurrences.

### Recommendations
1. **Refine the `attempted_flap_position` Rule**:
   - Add constraints to ensure the calculated `Pos` (new flap position) remains within the legal range (0-10) before accepting it. For example:
     ```prolog
     attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
         Time > 0,
         Prev is Time-1,
         flap_position(Prev, Old),
         \+ goal(Old),
         use_actuator(Time, A),
         actuator_strength(A, AS),
         goal(GP),
         AE is sign(GP-Old)*AS,
         wind_effect(Time, WE),
         TempPos is Old + AE + WE,
         (legal_flap_position(TempPos) -> Pos = TempPos ; Pos = Old).
     ```
   - This ensures the flap position never exceeds the legal range.

2. **Optimize Actuator Selection**:
   - The current actuator selection is random (50-50). Consider biasing the selection toward the stronger actuator (`a`) to improve the probability of reaching the goal.

3. **Adjust Wind Effect Probabilities**:
   - The wind effects are currently symmetric. If the goal is to move the flap left (from 6 to 4), consider adjusting the wind probabilities to favor leftward movement (e.g., higher probability for negative wind effects).

4. **Add Debugging Queries**:
   - Include queries to track intermediate states (e.g., `flap_position`, `wind_effect`) to better understand the system's behavior and identify bottlenecks.

5. **Validate with More Test Cases**:
   - Test the system with different initial positions and goals to ensure robustness.

By implementing these changes, the system should achieve higher probabilities of `goal_reached` and minimize `overrun_exception` occurrences.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
