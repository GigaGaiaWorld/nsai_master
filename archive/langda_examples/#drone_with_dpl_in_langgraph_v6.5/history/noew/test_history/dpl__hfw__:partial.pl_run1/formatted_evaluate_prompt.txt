<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

### Evaluation Report

#### <Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to detect numbers and operators from images and parse them into arithmetic expressions. The test result shows that the code successfully evaluates the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` to `-10.333333333333332`, which is correct. However, the code has some structural and logical issues that could lead to incorrect behavior in other cases. The requirements for detecting numbers from images (e.g., `image_5` as `5` and `image_6` as `6`) are met, but the parsing logic for subtraction is flawed.
</Overall_Analysis>

#### <Error_Summary>
1. **Subtraction Parsing Error**:
   - The rule for parsing subtraction (`parse([N1,-|T], R)`) incorrectly rewrites the expression as `N1 + (-1 * R2)`, which is not equivalent to `N1 - R2`. This leads to incorrect results for expressions involving subtraction.
   - **Root Cause**: The rule attempts to handle subtraction by converting it into addition with a negated term, but the implementation is incorrect.

2. **Incomplete `detect_all` Predicate**:
   - The `detect_all` predicate is incomplete in the provided code snippet. The recursive case is cut off, which could cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
   - **Root Cause**: Missing closing parenthesis and proper recursion handling.

3. **Potential Division by Zero**:
   - The `parse` rule for division checks `N2 \== 0`, but the error handling for division by zero is not explicitly addressed in the output or requirements.
   - **Root Cause**: Lack of explicit error handling or messaging for division by zero cases.
</Error_Summary>

#### <Recommendations>
1. **Fix Subtraction Parsing**:
   - Replace the incorrect subtraction rule with:
     ```prolog
     parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
         parse(T, R2),
         almost_equal(N1 - R2, R).
     ```

2. **Complete the `detect_all` Predicate**:
   - Ensure the predicate is properly closed and handles recursion correctly:
     ```prolog
     detect_all([N,O|T], [N2,O2|T2]) :-
         detect_number(N, N2),
         detect_operator(O, O2),
         detect_all(T, T2).
     ```

3. **Add Error Handling for Division by Zero**:
   - Explicitly handle division by zero cases, either by failing or providing a meaningful message:
     ```prolog
     parse([N1,/,N2|T], R) :-
         (N2 =:= 0 -> fail ; N3 is N1 / N2, parse([N3|T], R)).
     ```

4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Test the code with additional edge cases, such as:
     - Expressions with nested parentheses (if supported).
     - Division by zero.
     - Complex expressions with multiple operators.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and rule, especially for the `almost_equal` predicate, which is used for floating-point comparisons.

By addressing these issues, the code will be more robust and reliable for parsing arithmetic expressions from detected numbers and operators.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
