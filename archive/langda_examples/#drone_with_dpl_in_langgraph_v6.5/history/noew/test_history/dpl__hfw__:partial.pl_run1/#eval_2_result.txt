{"HASH": "AC455839", "ErrorSummary": "The expression predicate lacks error handling for invalid inputs and relies on parse/2 which has issues with subtraction and division.", "SuggestedFix": "Add input validation and ensure parse/2 is corrected as per the recommendations in the Error_Summary.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
