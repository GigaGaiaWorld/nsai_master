<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code implements the Monty Hall problem, and the test results align with the expected probabilities: 
- `win_keep` (probability of winning by keeping the initial choice) is approximately 0.3333.
- `win_switch` (probability of winning by switching doors) is approximately 0.6667.

The code correctly models the problem's requirements, including the host's behavior of opening a door that neither contains the prize nor is the contestant's initial choice. The probabilities match the theoretical solution, indicating that the logic is sound.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Issue**: The code snippet `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-` is incomplete and lacks proper indentation or continuation. However, the subsequent block (tagged with `A4F0EAE2`) completes the rule correctly.
   
2. **Redundancy**: The `member/2` predicate is defined twice in the code, which is unnecessary since it is a standard Prolog predicate. This redundancy does not affect functionality but could be cleaned up.

3. **Clarity**: The requirements for the `open_door` rules are met, but the code could benefit from comments or clearer variable naming to improve readability.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax**: Ensure the incomplete line `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-` is properly formatted or removed if redundant.

2. **Remove Redundancy**: Delete the redundant definition of `member/2` since it is a built-in predicate in Prolog and ProbLog.

3. **Improve Readability**:
   - Add comments to explain the logic of the `open_door` rules, especially the conditions under which the host opens a door.
   - Use more descriptive variable names (e.g., `SelectedDoor` instead of `Selected`) to clarify the code's intent.

4. **Validation**: Verify that the code handles edge cases, such as when the contestant's initial choice is the prize door, and ensure the host's behavior remains consistent with the problem's requirements.
