<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

</Final_Answer>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code implements the Monty Hall problem, and the test results align with the expected probabilities: 
- `win_keep` (probability of winning by keeping the initial choice) is approximately 0.3333.
- `win_switch` (probability of winning by switching doors) is approximately 0.6667.

The code correctly models the problem's requirements, including the host's behavior of opening a door that neither contains the prize nor is the contestant's initial choice. The probabilities match the theoretical solution, indicating that the logic is sound.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Issue**: The code snippet `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-` is incomplete and lacks proper indentation or continuation. However, the subsequent block (tagged with `A4F0EAE2`) completes the rule correctly.
   
2. **Redundancy**: The `member/2` predicate is defined twice in the code, which is unnecessary since it is a standard Prolog predicate. This redundancy does not affect functionality but could be cleaned up.

3. **Clarity**: The requirements for the `open_door` rules are met, but the code could benefit from comments or clearer variable naming to improve readability.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax**: Ensure the incomplete line `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-` is properly formatted or removed if redundant.

2. **Remove Redundancy**: Delete the redundant definition of `member/2` since it is a built-in predicate in Prolog and ProbLog.

3. **Improve Readability**:
   - Add comments to explain the logic of the `open_door` rules, especially the conditions under which the host opens a door.
   - Use more descriptive variable names (e.g., `SelectedDoor` instead of `Selected`) to clarify the code's intent.

4. **Validation**: Verify that the code handles edge cases, such as when the contestant's initial choice is the prize door, and ensure the host's behavior remains consistent with the problem's requirements.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
