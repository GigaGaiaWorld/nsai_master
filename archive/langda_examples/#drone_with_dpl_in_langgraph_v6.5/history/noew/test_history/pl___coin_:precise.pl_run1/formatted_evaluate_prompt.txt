<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

 Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'heads/1' at 8:5.
</Result>

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate a scenario where coins are flipped, and the success count (SC) is incremented if a coin lands heads. The final result is accumulated in S. However, the code fails during execution due to an undefined predicate `heads/1`. The overall structure of the code aligns with the requirements, but the missing predicate prevents it from functioning as intended.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Undefined Predicate `heads/1`**: 
   - The error message indicates that no clauses are found for the predicate `heads/1`. This predicate is used to check whether the `CNT`-th coin lands heads, but it is not defined anywhere in the code.
   - Root Cause: The predicate `heads/1` is essential for the logic but is missing. ProbLog requires all predicates to be explicitly defined or declared as probabilistic facts.

2. **Logical Gap**:
   - The code assumes the existence of a predicate `heads/1` to determine the outcome of each coin flip, but this assumption is not fulfilled.
   - Root Cause: The logic is incomplete without a mechanism to simulate or define the probabilistic behavior of coin flips.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Define the `heads/1` Predicate**:
   - Replace the undefined `heads/1` predicate with a probabilistic fact. For example:
     ```prolog
     0.8::heads(_). % Each coin has an 80% chance of landing heads
     ```
   - Alternatively, define it explicitly if the coin outcomes are deterministic or based on other logic.

2. **Clarify the Coin Representation**:
   - Ensure that the `coin/1` predicate is properly defined if it is intended to represent individual coins. For example:
     ```prolog
     coin(1). coin(2). coin(3). coin(4). % Define the coins
     ```

3. **Test the Revised Code**:
   - After defining `heads/1`, rerun the code to verify that it behaves as expected. For example:
     ```prolog
     0.8::heads(_).
     total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
     query(total(_)).
     ```

4. **Document Assumptions**:
   - Clearly document any assumptions about the probabilistic behavior of coins or other predicates to avoid confusion in future revisions or extensions of the code.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if itâ€™s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
