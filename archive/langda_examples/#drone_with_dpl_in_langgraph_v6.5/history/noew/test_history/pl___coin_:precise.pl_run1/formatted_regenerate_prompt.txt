 Error evaluating Problog model:

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'heads/1' at 8:5.
</Result>
<Analysis>
<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate a scenario where coins are flipped, and the success count (SC) is incremented if a coin lands heads. The code uses recursion to decrement the counter (CNT) until it reaches zero. However, the test results indicate a critical error: the predicate `heads/1` is undefined, leading to a failure in execution. The overall structure of the code aligns with the requirements, but the missing predicate prevents it from functioning as intended.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Undefined Predicate `heads/1`**: The error message explicitly states that no clauses are found for `heads/1`. This predicate is used in the recursive rules to check if a coin lands heads, but it is not defined anywhere in the code.
2. **Logical Gap**: The code assumes the existence of `heads/1` to determine the outcome of a coin flip, but this assumption is not fulfilled. This is a semantic issue, as the logic relies on an undefined predicate.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Define the `heads/1` Predicate**: 
   - Use ProbLog's probabilistic syntax to define `heads/1`. For example:
     ```prolog
     0.5::heads(C). % Each coin has a 50% chance of landing heads
     ```
   - Alternatively, if the probability is fixed (e.g., 0.8 as implied by `coin(C)`), define it as:
     ```prolog
     0.8::heads(C).
     ```
2. **Ensure Probabilistic Facts Are Grounded**: 
   - If `heads/1` depends on `coin(C)`, ensure that `coin(C)` is properly defined for all relevant coins (e.g., `coin(1). coin(2). ...`).
3. **Test the Updated Code**: 
   - After defining `heads/1`, rerun the test to verify that the code now correctly accumulates the success count (SC) based on the coin flips.
4. **Clarify Requirements**: 
   - If the probability of `heads/1` varies, ensure it is explicitly documented or parameterized in the code.

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed code here

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
