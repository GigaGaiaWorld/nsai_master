### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code is designed to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle," which involves determining the arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of given constraints. The test results indicate that the code successfully produces a valid solution, as evidenced by the output:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
This output satisfies all the constraints specified in the problem, confirming that the code is logically correct and functionally sound.

### Error Summary
No errors were identified in the code. The test results demonstrate that all constraints are correctly implemented, and the solution adheres to the problem's requirements. The predicates `my_member`, `right_of`, and `next_to` are used appropriately to enforce the constraints.

### Recommendations
1. **Code Clarity**: While the code is correct, adding comments to explain the purpose of each constraint or predicate could improve readability and maintainability.
2. **Testing Edge Cases**: Although the current test case passes, consider testing edge cases (e.g., empty lists or invalid inputs) to ensure robustness.
3. **Documentation**: Document the predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) if they are part of a larger library or reusable module, to clarify their usage for other developers.

Overall, the code is well-structured and meets the problem's requirements. No fixes are necessary, but minor improvements in documentation and testing could enhance its quality further.
