<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code for the zebra puzzle is well-structured and adheres to the logical constraints of the puzzle. The test result indicates that the code successfully solves the puzzle, producing a valid arrangement of houses that satisfies all the given rules. The output matches the expected solution, confirming that the code is logically correct and meets the requirements.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code or the test results. The code correctly implements all the constraints of the zebra puzzle, and the test output aligns with the expected solution. The predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are correctly defined and used to enforce the puzzle's rules.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Clarity**: While the code is correct, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each predicate or rule for better readability and maintainability.
2. **Testing Edge Cases**: Although the current test case passes, it might be beneficial to test additional edge cases or variations of the puzzle to ensure robustness.
3. **Performance Optimization**: If the puzzle is scaled to more houses or constraints, review the performance of the predicates (e.g., `right_of`, `next_to`) to ensure they remain efficient.
4. **Documentation**: Document the code's assumptions (e.g., the order of attributes in the `house` predicate) to avoid confusion during future modifications.
