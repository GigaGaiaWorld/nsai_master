<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population density. The code is logically structured and adheres to the requirements, but it fails due to a syntax error ("Empty statement found at 24:1"). This error suggests an issue with the code's formatting or structure, likely an unintended line break or missing content. The rest of the code, including the predicates and arithmetic operations, appears correct and aligns with ProbLog's supported features.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Test Failure**: The error message indicates an "Empty statement found at 24:1," which means the parser encountered an unexpected blank line or incomplete statement at line 24.
2. **Root Cause**: The issue is purely syntactic. ProbLog requires all statements to be complete and properly terminated. The error likely arises from an extra line break or missing content in the code, disrupting the parser's expectations.
3. **Impact**: The error prevents the code from being executed, so no results are generated for the query.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix the Syntax Error**:
   - Inspect line 24 of the code and ensure there are no unintended blank lines or incomplete statements.
   - If the issue persists, verify that all predicates and clauses are properly terminated with a period (`.`).

2. **Code Formatting**:
   - Ensure consistent indentation and spacing to avoid parser confusion.
   - Remove any redundant or misplaced line breaks.

3. **Testing**:
   - After fixing the syntax error, re-run the code to confirm it executes without errors.
   - Validate the output to ensure it meets the requirements (e.g., pairs of countries with approximately equal population density).

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and the arithmetic logic (e.g., the use of `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` for density approximation).

5. **Additional Checks**:
   - Ensure all predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, and `density/2`) are correctly defined and populated with data.
   - Verify that the arithmetic operations (`D is (P * 100) / A`) produce the expected results for all input combinations.
