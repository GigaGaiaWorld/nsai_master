<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to query countries with approximately equal population densities by comparing their densities using integer arithmetic to avoid division. The test results show successful matches, indicating that the code generally meets the requirements. However, the density calculation and comparison logic should be reviewed for potential edge cases or inaccuracies due to integer division.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Density Calculation Precision**: The density is calculated using floor division (`//`), which may truncate fractional parts, leading to less precise comparisons. For example, densities like `76` and `77` might be closer than the test results suggest.
2. **Comparison Logic**: The inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1` approximate a ratio of `1.05`, but the integer division in `density/2` could skew this approximation.
3. **Test Coverage**: The test results do not include cases where densities are very close but not exactly matching the approximation, which could reveal issues with the comparison logic.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Improve Density Calculation**: Replace floor division (`//`) with floating-point division (`/`) to retain fractional precision. For example:
   ```prolog
   D is (P * 100) / A.
   ```
2. **Refine Comparison Logic**: Adjust the inequalities to account for floating-point densities. For example:
   ```prolog
   0.95 * D1 < D2, D2 < 1.05 * D1.
   ```
3. **Expand Test Cases**: Include edge cases where densities are very close but not exact matches to ensure the comparison logic works as intended.
4. **Document Assumptions**: Clarify in comments why the inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` are used and how they approximate the desired ratio.
