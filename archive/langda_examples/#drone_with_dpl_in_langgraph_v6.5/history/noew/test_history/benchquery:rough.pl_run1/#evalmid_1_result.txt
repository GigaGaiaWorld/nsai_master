<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code is designed to calculate the population density of countries and find pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities (within 5%). The test results show that the code successfully identifies such pairs, as evidenced by the output probabilities of 1.0000 for each query. This indicates that the logic of the `query_pop` predicate is functioning correctly, and the arithmetic comparisons are being handled as intended. The code meets the specified requirements and performs as expected.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code or the test results. The `query_pop` predicate correctly implements the logic to compare population densities and filter results within the 5% threshold. The arithmetic operations (`abs`, `max`, and division) are supported in ProbLog, and the results align with the expected behavior.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Clarity**: Consider adding comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and the logic behind the arithmetic comparisons. For example, explain why the 5% threshold is implemented as `abs(Density1 - Density2) =< 0.05 * max(Density1, Density2)`.
   
2. **Testing Edge Cases**: While the current test cases are valid, it would be beneficial to test edge cases, such as:
   - Countries with identical population densities.
   - Countries with very large or very small population densities to ensure the arithmetic operations remain accurate.

3. **Performance Optimization**: If the database of countries grows significantly, the current implementation may become inefficient due to the nested loops in the `query_pop` predicate. Consider optimizing the predicate or using indexing to improve performance.

4. **Documentation**: Document the assumptions made in the code, such as the units of population (100,000s) and area (1,000 square miles), to avoid confusion for future users or maintainers.
