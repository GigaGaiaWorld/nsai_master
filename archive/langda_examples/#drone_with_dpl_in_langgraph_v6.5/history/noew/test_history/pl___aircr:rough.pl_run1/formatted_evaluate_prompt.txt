<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

### Evaluation Report

#### **Overall_Analysis**
The provided ProbLog code for the Aircraft Flap Controller is logically structured and adheres to the requirements of calculating the flap position based on actuator strength, wind effects, and the goal position. The test results indicate that the system behaves probabilistically as expected, with probabilities assigned to goal achievement and overrun exceptions. However, the probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` suggest that the system could be optimized for better reliability, especially in later time steps.

#### **Error_Summary**
1. **Test Failures**:
   - The probability of `goal_reached` decreases over time (from 0.5 at T=1 to 0.0121 at T=5), which may indicate inefficiency in reaching the goal.
   - The `overrun_exception` probabilities are non-zero at T=3, T=4, and T=5, suggesting occasional illegal flap positions due to wind effects or actuator strength.

2. **Root Causes**:
   - **Wind Effects**: The wind model introduces variability that can push the flap position beyond legal bounds, especially when the wind is strong.
   - **Actuator Strength**: The actuator strength (`a=2`, `b=1`) combined with wind effects may lead to overshooting or undershooting the goal.
   - **Clamping Logic**: The clamping logic (`min`/`max`) may not always prevent illegal positions due to cumulative wind effects.

3. **Structural Issues**:
   - The code does not explicitly handle cases where the wind effect could cause the flap position to oscillate around the goal without stabilizing.

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Refine Wind Model**:
   - Adjust the probabilities of wind effects to reduce extreme values (e.g., limit strong wind effects to ±2 instead of ±3).
   - Example:
     ```prolog
     0.2::wind_effect(T,-2); 0.3::wind_effect(T,-1); 0.3::wind_effect(T,1); 0.2::wind_effect(T,2) :- wind(strong).
     ```

2. **Optimize Actuator Selection**:
   - Introduce a bias toward the stronger actuator (`a`) when the goal is far and the weaker actuator (`b`) when close to the goal.
   - Example:
     ```prolog
     use_actuator(T, a) :- flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), goal(G), abs(G - PrevPos) >= 2.
     use_actuator(T, b) :- flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), goal(G), abs(G - PrevPos) < 2.
     ```

3. **Enhance Clamping Logic**:
   - Ensure the flap position never exceeds legal bounds by adding explicit checks before updating the position.
   - Example:
     ```prolog
     attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
         Time > 0,
         Prev is Time-1,
         flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
         goal(G),
         \+ goal_reached(Prev),
         use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
         actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
         wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
         TempPos is PrevPos + (G > PrevPos ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect,
         (legal_flap_position(TempPos) -> Pos = TempPos ; Pos = PrevPos).
     ```

4. **Add Stabilization Logic**:
   - Introduce a rule to stabilize the flap position once the goal is reached to avoid unnecessary movements.
   - Example:
     ```prolog
     flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
         Time > 0,
         goal_reached(Prev),
         Prev is Time-1,
         flap_position(Prev, Pos).
     ```

5. **Testing**:
   - Re-run the tests with the updated code to verify improvements in `goal_reached` probabilities and reduction in `overrun_exception` occurrences.

By implementing these changes, the system should achieve higher reliability and efficiency in reaching the goal while minimizing illegal flap positions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
