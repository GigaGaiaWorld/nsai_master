  "ErrorSummary": "1. The movement logic does not bound the wind effect to ensure the flap remains within legal positions. 2. The actuator selection is random and does not prioritize the stronger actuator for faster convergence. 3. The decreasing probability of `goal_reached` suggests inefficient movement logic.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Modify the `attempted_flap_position` rule to clamp the calculated position to the nearest legal value (0-10). 2. Adjust the probabilities for `use_actuator` to favor the stronger actuator (`a`) when the goal is farther away. 3. Add a condition to check if the goal is reachable in the next step and adjust the movement accordingly.",
