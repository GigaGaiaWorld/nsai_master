  "ErrorSummary": "1. Decreasing `goal_reached` probabilities due to lack of backtracking check. 2. Non-zero `overrun_exception` probabilities due to insufficient clamping. 3. Edge cases not handled for wind effect overshooting.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Modify `goal_reached` to check previous time steps. 2. Refine clamping logic in `attempted_flap_position` to clamp to goal position rather than legal range. 3. Add logic to stop movement once goal is reached. Example fix:\n```prolog\ngoal_reached(Time) :-\n    goal(G),\n    flap_position(Time, G),\n    \\+ (between(1, Time-1, T), flap_position(T, G)).\n\nattempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-\n    Time > 0,\n    Prev is Time-1,\n    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),\n    goal(G),\n    \\+ goal_reached(Prev),\n    use_actuator(Time, Actuator),\n    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),\n    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),\n    (\n        (G > PrevPos, TempPos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect, Pos is min(TempPos, G))\n        ;\n        (G < PrevPos, TempPos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect, Pos is max(TempPos, G))\n        ;\n        (G =:= PrevPos, Pos = PrevPos)\n    ).\n```",
