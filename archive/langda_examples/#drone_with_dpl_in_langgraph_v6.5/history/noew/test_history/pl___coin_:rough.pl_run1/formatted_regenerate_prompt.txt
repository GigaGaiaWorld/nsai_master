  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
<Analysis>
<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing coins and counting the number of heads. However, the code fails due to a `NonGroundProbabilisticClause` error, indicating that the probabilistic clause is not fully grounded (i.e., contains uninstantiated variables). The error occurs because the `coin(C)` predicate is not properly grounded before being used in a probabilistic context. The overall structure of the code aligns with the requirements, but the implementation violates ProbLog's grounding rules.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Error**: `NonGroundProbabilisticClause` at line 1:5.
   - **Root Cause**: The probabilistic clause `PH::make_coin(C, PH)` is not grounded because the variable `C` is not instantiated before being used in the probabilistic context. ProbLog requires all variables in probabilistic clauses to be grounded (i.e., bound to specific values) before evaluation.
   - **Location**: The issue originates in the `make_coin` predicate and propagates through the `coin(C)` predicate.

2. **Logical Issue**:
   - The `coin(C)` predicate relies on `make_coin(C, 0.8)`, but `C` remains uninstantiated, leading to the grounding error.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Ground the Probabilistic Clause**:
   - Ensure that all variables in probabilistic clauses are instantiated. For example, replace `PH::make_coin(C, PH)` with a grounded version like `0.8::make_coin(head).` and `0.2::make_coin(tail).` to represent the coin toss outcomes explicitly.

2. **Revise the `coin` Predicate**:
   - Modify the `coin(C)` predicate to use grounded probabilistic facts. For example:
     ```prolog
     0.8::coin(head).
     0.2::coin(tail).
     ```

3. **Update the Recursive Logic**:
   - Adjust the `coins_r` predicate to work with the grounded `coin` facts. For example:
     ```prolog
     coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
     coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
         CNT > 0,
         coin(C),
         (C = head, NewSC is SC + 1 ; C = tail, NewSC = SC),
         NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT).
     ```

4. **Test the Revised Code**:
   - After making the changes, test the code with the query `query(total(_)).` to ensure it runs without errors and meets the requirements.

5. **Additional Resources**:
   - Refer to the ProbLog documentation for grounding rules and examples of probabilistic clauses: [ProbLog FAQ](https://problog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html).

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).

    (C = head, NewSC is SC + 1 ; C = tail, NewSC = SC),

total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
