<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code implements a bubble sort algorithm, and the test result indicates that it successfully sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`. The code adheres to the requirements of recursively calling `bubblesort` on the intermediate list `L2` and appending the current maximum value `X` to the sorted part `[X|L3]`. The logical predicates for swapping (`swap/3`) and the overall structure of the sorting algorithm are correctly implemented.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **No Test Failures**: The test case provided in the `<Result>` block passes successfully, indicating that the code works as expected for the given input.
2. **Potential Edge Cases**: While the current test case passes, the code may not handle edge cases such as an empty list or a list with duplicate elements. These scenarios should be tested to ensure robustness.
3. **Code Readability**: The predicate `hole/4` is not descriptively named, which could make the code harder to understand. A more descriptive name like `compare_and_swap/4` would improve readability.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Test Edge Cases**: Add test cases for edge scenarios, such as:
   - An empty list: `query(forth_sort([], X))`.
   - A list with duplicate elements: `query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 2, 5], X))`.
   - A list already sorted: `query(forth_sort([1, 2, 3], X))`.
2. **Improve Predicate Naming**: Rename `hole/4` to something more descriptive, like `compare_and_swap/4`, to enhance code clarity.
3. **Document the Code**: Add comments to explain the purpose of each predicate and the overall logic of the bubble sort algorithm. This will make the code easier to maintain and debug.
4. **Optimize the Algorithm**: While the current implementation works, bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm. Consider documenting its inefficiency or exploring other sorting algorithms if performance is a concern.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
