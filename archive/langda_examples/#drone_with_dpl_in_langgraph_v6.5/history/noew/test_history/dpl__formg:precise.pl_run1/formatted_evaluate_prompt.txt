<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code for `merge_sort` appears to be logically correct and successfully passes the given test case, producing the expected sorted output `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` for the input `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`. The implementation adheres to the requirements, including recursive boundary checks, splitting the list, and merging the sorted sublists. The code is also compatible with ProbLog's syntax restrictions, avoiding unsupported constructs like cuts or imperative control.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the provided code or test results. The implementation meets the specified requirements:
1. It correctly calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine whether to split further.
2. It handles the base cases (empty list and single-element list) appropriately.
3. It splits the list into two parts (`Left` and `Right`) for recursive processing.
4. It recursively sorts the sublists and merges them into the final sorted result.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Edge Case Testing**: While the current test case is successful, consider adding additional test cases to verify edge conditions, such as:
   - An empty list (`[]`).
   - A single-element list (`[X]`).
   - A list with duplicate elements (`[3, 1, 2, 1, 5]`).
   - A pre-sorted list (`[1, 2, 3, 4]`).

2. **Performance Optimization**: The current implementation is correct but may not be optimized for performance. For larger lists, consider:
   - Using tail recursion where possible.
   - Avoiding redundant computations (e.g., recalculating lengths).

3. **Documentation**: Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and the logic behind the splitting and merging steps. This will improve readability and maintainability.

4. **ProbLog-Specific Features**: If the code is intended for probabilistic reasoning, ensure that any probabilistic extensions (e.g., annotated disjunctions or probabilistic facts) are correctly integrated without violating ProbLog's semantics.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
