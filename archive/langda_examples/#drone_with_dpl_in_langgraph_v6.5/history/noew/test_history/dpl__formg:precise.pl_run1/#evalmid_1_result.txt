<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code for `merge_sort` appears to be logically correct and successfully passes the given test case, producing the expected sorted output `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` for the input `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`. The implementation adheres to the requirements, including recursive boundary checks, splitting the list, and merging the sorted sublists. The code is also compatible with ProbLog's syntax restrictions, avoiding unsupported constructs like cuts or imperative control.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the provided code or test results. The implementation meets the specified requirements:
1. It correctly calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine whether to split further.
2. It handles the base cases (empty list and single-element list) appropriately.
3. It splits the list into two parts (`Left` and `Right`) for recursive processing.
4. It recursively sorts the sublists and merges them into the final sorted result.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Edge Case Testing**: While the current test case is successful, consider adding additional test cases to verify edge conditions, such as:
   - An empty list (`[]`).
   - A single-element list (`[X]`).
   - A list with duplicate elements (`[3, 1, 2, 1, 5]`).
   - A pre-sorted list (`[1, 2, 3, 4]`).

2. **Performance Optimization**: The current implementation is correct but may not be optimized for performance. For larger lists, consider:
   - Using tail recursion where possible.
   - Avoiding redundant computations (e.g., recalculating lengths).

3. **Documentation**: Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and the logic behind the splitting and merging steps. This will improve readability and maintainability.

4. **ProbLog-Specific Features**: If the code is intended for probabilistic reasoning, ensure that any probabilistic extensions (e.g., annotated disjunctions or probabilistic facts) are correctly integrated without violating ProbLog's semantics.
