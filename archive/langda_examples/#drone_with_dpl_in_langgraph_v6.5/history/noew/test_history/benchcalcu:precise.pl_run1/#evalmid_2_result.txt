### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (`AB + BCD = CDE`) by defining digits, ensuring uniqueness of digits, and simulating column-wise addition with carry. However, the code fails to execute due to a `ParseError` indicating an "Empty statement found." This suggests a syntax or structural issue in the code, likely related to incomplete or misplaced predicates or rules.

### Error Summary
1. **ParseError: Empty statement found**  
   - **Location**: The error occurs at line 40:1 in the code, indicating an empty or incomplete statement in the ProbLog parser.
   - **Root Cause**: The issue likely stems from:
     - A missing or incomplete predicate definition.
     - Misplaced or unclosed parentheses or brackets.
     - An empty line or comment that the parser interprets as an incomplete statement.

2. **Potential Logical Issues**  
   - The `query_sum` predicate is partially defined in the `<Langda>` block but may not be properly integrated into the main code.
   - The `sumdigit` predicate logic appears correct, but the error suggests the parser cannot proceed due to the empty statement.

### Recommendations
1. **Fix the Empty Statement**  
   - Review the code around line 40 to ensure no empty or incomplete statements exist.
   - Ensure all predicates (`digit`, `leftdigit`, `all_different`, `sumdigit`, and `query_sum`) are properly defined and closed.

2. **Integrate the `<Langda>` Block**  
   - The `query_sum` predicate in the `<Langda>` block should be merged into the main code without duplication or overlap.
   - Verify that the `query_sum` predicate is correctly placed and does not leave any dangling clauses.

3. **Test Incrementally**  
   - Test each predicate (`digit`, `leftdigit`, `all_different`, `sumdigit`) individually to ensure they work as expected.
   - Gradually combine them to isolate the source of the error.

4. **Check Syntax and Structure**  
   - Ensure all parentheses, brackets, and commas are correctly placed.
   - Remove any redundant or misplaced comments or whitespace that might confuse the parser.

5. **Consult ProbLog Documentation**  
   - Refer to the ProbLog documentation for syntax rules and supported constructs to avoid unsupported features (e.g., cuts, if-then-else).

By addressing these issues, the code should execute correctly and solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle as intended.
