<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

problog.parser.ParseError: Empty statement found at 40:1.
</Result>

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) by defining digits, ensuring uniqueness of digits, and simulating column-wise addition with carry. The code structure aligns with the requirements, but the test results indicate a parsing error ("Empty statement found"). This suggests a syntax or structural issue in the code, likely due to an incomplete or malformed statement.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **ParseError: Empty statement found**:
   - **Location**: The error occurs at line 40:1, indicating an empty or incomplete statement in the code.
   - **Root Cause**: The issue likely stems from a missing or improperly formatted predicate or clause. For example, the `query_sum` predicate might be incomplete or malformed, or there could be an issue with the `query` call at the end of the file.
   - **Additional Notes**: The error is raised by ProbLog's parser when it encounters an empty or invalid statement during parsing.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix the ParseError**:
   - **Inspect Line 40**: Check the line where the error occurs (line 40:1) for any missing or incomplete statements. Ensure all predicates and clauses are properly terminated with a period (`.`).
   - **Validate the `query_sum` Predicate**: Ensure the `query_sum` predicate is correctly defined and closed. For example, verify that the closing parenthesis and period are present.
   - **Check the `query` Call**: Ensure the `query(query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]))` call is properly formatted and terminated.

2. **Debugging Tips**:
   - **Use Comments**: Temporarily comment out sections of the code to isolate the issue.
   - **Test Incrementally**: Test the code in smaller parts (e.g., test `digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, and `sumdigit/5` separately) to ensure each component works as expected.

3. **General Improvements**:
   - **Code Formatting**: Ensure consistent indentation and spacing to improve readability and reduce the likelihood of syntax errors.
   - **Documentation**: Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and clause, especially for complex logic like `sumdigit/5`.

4. **Refer to ProbLog Documentation**:
   - Review the ProbLog documentation for supported syntax and control constructs to ensure compliance with the language's requirements.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if itâ€™s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
