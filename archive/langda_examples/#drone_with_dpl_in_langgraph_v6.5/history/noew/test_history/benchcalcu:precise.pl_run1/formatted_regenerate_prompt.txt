 Here are the testing result of code:
 Error evaluating Problog model:
    return list(map(f, l))
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1013, in _extract_statements
    raise ParseError(string, "Empty statement found", token.location)
problog.parser.ParseError: Empty statement found at 40:1.
</Result>
<Analysis>
### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (`AB + BCD = CDE`) by defining digits, ensuring uniqueness of digits, and simulating column-wise addition with carry. However, the code fails to execute due to a `ParseError` indicating an "Empty statement found." This suggests a syntax or structural issue in the code, likely related to incomplete or misplaced predicates or rules.

### Error Summary
1. **ParseError: Empty statement found**  
   - **Location**: The error occurs at line 40:1 in the code, indicating an empty or incomplete statement in the ProbLog parser.
   - **Root Cause**: The issue likely stems from:
     - A missing or incomplete predicate definition.
     - Misplaced or unclosed parentheses or brackets.
     - An empty line or comment that the parser interprets as an incomplete statement.

2. **Potential Logical Issues**  
   - The `query_sum` predicate is partially defined in the `<Langda>` block but may not be properly integrated into the main code.
   - The `sumdigit` predicate logic appears correct, but the error suggests the parser cannot proceed due to the empty statement.

### Recommendations
1. **Fix the Empty Statement**  
   - Review the code around line 40 to ensure no empty or incomplete statements exist.
   - Ensure all predicates (`digit`, `leftdigit`, `all_different`, `sumdigit`, and `query_sum`) are properly defined and closed.

2. **Integrate the `<Langda>` Block**  
   - The `query_sum` predicate in the `<Langda>` block should be merged into the main code without duplication or overlap.
   - Verify that the `query_sum` predicate is correctly placed and does not leave any dangling clauses.

3. **Test Incrementally**  
   - Test each predicate (`digit`, `leftdigit`, `all_different`, `sumdigit`) individually to ensure they work as expected.
   - Gradually combine them to isolate the source of the error.

4. **Check Syntax and Structure**  
   - Ensure all parentheses, brackets, and commas are correctly placed.
   - Remove any redundant or misplaced comments or whitespace that might confuse the parser.

5. **Consult ProbLog Documentation**  
   - Refer to the ProbLog documentation for syntax rules and supported constructs to avoid unsupported features (e.g., cuts, if-then-else).

By addressing these issues, the code should execute correctly and solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle as intended.

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
