<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to model the game of rock-paper-scissors and determine the winner based on a series of moves. The code includes definitions for moves, win-lose relationships, and functions to compute results and scores. However, the test results indicate an error (`UnknownClause`) during execution, suggesting a missing or undefined predicate. The overall structure of the code is logical, but it fails due to unsupported control constructs (if-then-else) and potential issues with predicate definitions.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **UnknownClause Error**: The error `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 44:16` indicates that the if-then-else construct (`->`) is not supported in ProbLog. This construct is used in the `determine_winner` predicate to decide the winner based on the score.
2. **Missing Predicate Definition**: The error may also stem from an incomplete or undefined predicate in the code, though the primary issue is the unsupported control construct.
3. **Logical Flow**: The `determine_winner` predicate relies on `play` and `compute_score`, which are correctly defined, but the unsupported if-then-else construct disrupts the logical flow.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace If-Then-Else**: Replace the unsupported if-then-else construct in `determine_winner` with a supported alternative, such as using conjunction and disjunction:
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
       compute_score(Results, Score),
       (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1';
        Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2';
        Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
   ```
2. **Verify Predicate Definitions**: Ensure all predicates (`play`, `compute_score`, `result`) are correctly defined and called. The error message suggests no issues here, but double-checking is advisable.
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test each predicate (`play`, `compute_score`) separately to isolate any potential issues before integrating them into `determine_winner`.
4. **Documentation Review**: Refer to ProbLog's documentation for supported control constructs and ensure compliance with its syntax rules.
