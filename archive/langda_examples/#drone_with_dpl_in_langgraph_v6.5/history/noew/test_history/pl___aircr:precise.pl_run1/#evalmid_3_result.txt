<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, such as actuator selection and wind effects. The test results show that the probability of reaching the goal (`goal_reached`) decreases over time, while the probability of an overrun exception (`overrun_exception`) peaks around time steps 3 and 4. The code generally adheres to ProbLog syntax and requirements, but there are potential issues with the logic for calculating the flap position and handling edge cases (e.g., when the goal is already reached or when the position exceeds legal bounds).
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Decreasing Probability of `goal_reached`**:
   - The probability of `goal_reached` decreases over time, which is counterintuitive since the system should ideally converge toward the goal. This suggests a logical flaw in the `attempted_flap_position` rule, where the actuator and wind effects might be pushing the flap away from the goal.

2. **Overrun Exceptions**:
   - The presence of `overrun_exception` indicates that the flap position sometimes exceeds the legal range (0-10). This happens because the wind effect and actuator thrust are not constrained to keep the position within bounds. The rule for `legal_flap_position` is only checked after calculating the new position, which is too late to prevent overruns.

3. **Negation-as-Failure**:
   - The use of `\+ goal_reached(Prev)` in the `attempted_flap_position` rule is correct, but the logic for stopping further updates once the goal is reached could be more explicit.

4. **Wind and Actuator Effects**:
   - The wind effect (`wind_effect`) and actuator thrust (`actuator_strength`) are combined additively, which might lead to overshooting the goal or exceeding bounds. A more controlled approach (e.g., clamping the position) could mitigate this.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Clamp Flap Position**:
   - Modify the `attempted_flap_position` rule to ensure the calculated position (`Pos`) stays within the legal range (0-10) before checking `legal_flap_position`. For example:
     ```prolog
     Pos is max(0, min(10, Old + AE + WE)).
     ```

2. **Early Termination**:
   - Add an explicit check to stop further updates once the goal is reached. For example:
     ```prolog
     attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
         Time > 0,
         Prev is Time - 1,
         flap_position(Prev, Old),
         (goal_reached(Prev) -> Pos = Old ; 
          use_actuator(Time, A),
          actuator_strength(A, AS),
          goal(GP),
          AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,
          wind_effect(Time, WE),
          Pos is max(0, min(10, Old + AE + WE))).
     ```

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add debug queries to inspect intermediate values (e.g., `AE`, `WE`, and `Pos`) to understand why the system diverges from the goal.

4. **Wind Effect Scaling**:
   - Consider scaling the wind effect (`WE`) based on the distance to the goal or the remaining legal range to avoid overshooting.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test edge cases, such as starting at the goal position or near the bounds (0 or 10), to ensure robustness.
