  "HASH": "62719B9D",
  "ErrorSummary": "1. The probability of `goal_reached` decreases over time, indicating a logical flaw in the `attempted_flap_position` rule. 2. Overrun exceptions occur due to unconstrained wind and actuator effects. 3. The rule does not explicitly stop updates once the goal is reached.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the `attempted_flap_position` rule to clamp the position within legal bounds and add explicit goal-checking logic:\n```prolog\nattempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-\n    Time > 0,\n    Prev is Time - 1,\n    flap_position(Prev, Old),\n    (goal_reached(Prev) -> Pos = Old ; \n     use_actuator(Time, A),\n     actuator_strength(A, AS),\n     goal(GP),\n     AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,\n     wind_effect(Time, WE),\n     Pos is max(0, min(10, Old + AE + WE))).\n```",
