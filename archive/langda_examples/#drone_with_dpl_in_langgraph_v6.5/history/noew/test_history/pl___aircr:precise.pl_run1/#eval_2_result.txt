  "HASH": "62719B9D",
  "ErrorSummary": "The logic for calculating the actuator effect (AE) could be simplified using the `sign/1` function for clarity. The current implementation uses conditional logic which is less readable and potentially error-prone.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the conditional logic for `AE` with `AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS` for clarity and conciseness. This change should be made in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": true
