<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to model an aircraft flap controller, incorporating probabilistic elements like actuator selection and wind effects. The code is logically structured but encounters a runtime error (`UnknownClause`) due to unsupported control constructs (specifically, the `if-then-else` logic). The error indicates a mismatch between the code's syntax and ProbLog's supported features. Despite this, the code's design aligns with the requirements, such as goal checking, actuator selection, and wind effect integration.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Error**: `UnknownClause` at line 38:15.
   - **Root Cause**: The error arises because ProbLog does not support the `if-then-else` construct (`->`). The code attempts to use this construct to determine the actuator's contribution (`AE`), which is not valid in ProbLog.
   - **Impact**: The runtime fails to evaluate the clause, halting execution.

2. **Logical Issue**: The code assumes the `if-then-else` construct for conditional logic, which is not supported in ProbLog. This affects the calculation of `AE` (actuator effect) based on the goal and current position.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace `if-then-else` with Supported Constructs**:
   - Use a conjunction (`Condition, Action`) and disjunction (`;`) to emulate `if-then-else`. For example:
     ```prolog
     (GP > Old, AE is AS) ; (GP =< Old, AE is -AS)
     ```
   - This aligns with ProbLog's supported control predicates.

2. **Validate Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Ensure all arithmetic operations (e.g., `Pos is Old + AE + WE`) use supported operators and functions. The current arithmetic logic is correct but should be verified for edge cases (e.g., `Pos` exceeding bounds).

3. **Test with ProbLog-Compatible Logic**:
   - After refactoring, test the code to confirm it meets the requirements without runtime errors. Focus on:
     - Goal checking (`goal_reached`).
     - Actuator selection and effect calculation.
     - Wind effect integration.

4. **Documentation Review**:
   - Refer to the ProbLog documentation for supported control constructs and arithmetic operations to avoid similar issues in the future.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Add checks for undefined predicates or edge cases (e.g., `legal_flap_position` bounds) to prevent silent failures.
