Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "62719B9D","Code": "flap_position(Prev, Old),\n \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n use_actuator(Time, A),\n actuator_strength(A, AS),\n goal(GP),\n (GP > Old, AE is AS ; GP =< Old, AE is -AS),\n wind_effect(Time, WE),\n Pos is Old + AE + WE."}
```

This code block implements all the requirements specified in the <Langda> section:
1. Checks if goal has been reached
2. Determines current actuator and its strength
3. Calculates direction and contribution of actuator
4. Superimposes wind interference to calculate new position
