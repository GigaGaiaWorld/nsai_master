Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "62719B9D", "Code": "flap_position(Prev, Old),\n    \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n    use_actuator(Time, A),\n    actuator_strength(A, AS),\n    goal(GP),\n    (GP > Old -> AE is AS ; AE is -AS),\n    wind_effect(Time, WE),\n    Pos is Old + AE + WE."}
```

This code block implements all the requirements specified in the <Langda> section:
1. Checks if goal has been reached with `\+ goal_reached(Prev)`
2. Determines current actuator and strength with `use_actuator(Time, A)` and `actuator_strength(A, AS)`
3. Calculates actuator direction with `(GP > Old -> AE is AS ; AE is -AS)`
4. Superimposes wind interference with `wind_effect(Time, WE)` and combines all effects with `Pos is Old + AE + WE`
