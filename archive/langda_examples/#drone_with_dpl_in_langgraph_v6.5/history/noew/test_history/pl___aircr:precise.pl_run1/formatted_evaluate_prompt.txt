<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, such as actuator selection and wind effects. The test results show that the probability of reaching the goal (`goal_reached`) decreases over time, while the probability of an overrun exception (`overrun_exception`) peaks around time steps 3 and 4. The code generally adheres to ProbLog syntax and requirements, but there are potential issues with the logic for calculating the flap position and handling edge cases (e.g., when the goal is already reached or when the position exceeds legal bounds).
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Decreasing Probability of `goal_reached`**:
   - The probability of `goal_reached` decreases over time, which is counterintuitive since the system should ideally converge toward the goal. This suggests a logical flaw in the `attempted_flap_position` rule, where the actuator and wind effects might be pushing the flap away from the goal.

2. **Overrun Exceptions**:
   - The presence of `overrun_exception` indicates that the flap position sometimes exceeds the legal range (0-10). This happens because the wind effect and actuator thrust are not constrained to keep the position within bounds. The rule for `legal_flap_position` is only checked after calculating the new position, which is too late to prevent overruns.

3. **Negation-as-Failure**:
   - The use of `\+ goal_reached(Prev)` in the `attempted_flap_position` rule is correct, but the logic for stopping further updates once the goal is reached could be more explicit.

4. **Wind and Actuator Effects**:
   - The wind effect (`wind_effect`) and actuator thrust (`actuator_strength`) are combined additively, which might lead to overshooting the goal or exceeding bounds. A more controlled approach (e.g., clamping the position) could mitigate this.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Clamp Flap Position**:
   - Modify the `attempted_flap_position` rule to ensure the calculated position (`Pos`) stays within the legal range (0-10) before checking `legal_flap_position`. For example:
     ```prolog
     Pos is max(0, min(10, Old + AE + WE)).
     ```

2. **Early Termination**:
   - Add an explicit check to stop further updates once the goal is reached. For example:
     ```prolog
     attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
         Time > 0,
         Prev is Time - 1,
         flap_position(Prev, Old),
         (goal_reached(Prev) -> Pos = Old ; 
          use_actuator(Time, A),
          actuator_strength(A, AS),
          goal(GP),
          AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,
          wind_effect(Time, WE),
          Pos is max(0, min(10, Old + AE + WE))).
     ```

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add debug queries to inspect intermediate values (e.g., `AE`, `WE`, and `Pos`) to understand why the system diverges from the goal.

4. **Wind Effect Scaling**:
   - Consider scaling the wind effect (`WE`) based on the distance to the goal or the remaining legal range to avoid overshooting.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test edge cases, such as starting at the goal position or near the bounds (0 or 10), to ensure robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
