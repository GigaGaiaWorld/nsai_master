The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It successfully replicates the logic of the original zebra puzzle solution, including all constraints and member checks. The only differences are in the formatting and the definition of 'next_to', which is now implemented using 'right_of' instead of separate clauses. This change does not affect the functionality as it maintains the same logical relationships between houses. Both codes produce identical results when executed.
