% Base case: an empty list is already sorted
insertion_sort([], []).

% Recursive case: insert the head into the sorted tail
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert(H, SortedTail, Sorted).

% Insert an element into a sorted list
insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :-
    X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :-
    X > Y,
    insert(X, Ys, Zs).
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog. The only differences are in the naming of the helper predicate (insert_element vs insert) and some additional comments in the generated code, which do not affect the logic or behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.
