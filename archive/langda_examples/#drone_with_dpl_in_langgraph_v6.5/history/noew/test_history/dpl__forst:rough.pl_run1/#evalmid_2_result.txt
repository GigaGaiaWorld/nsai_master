<Overall_Analysis>
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The test results indicate that all these operations work as expected, with each query returning the correct output with a probability of 1.0000. The code adheres to the requirements and demonstrates correct logical behavior for the specified stack operations. However, the `sort` operation is not tested, and its implementation is incomplete (missing the `insertion_sort` predicate). Overall, the code is well-structured and meets the requirements for the tested operations.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Untested `sort` Operation**: The `sort` operation is defined but not tested in the provided test cases. Additionally, the `insertion_sort` predicate, which is required for the `sort` operation, is missing. This could lead to runtime errors if the `sort` operation is used without implementing `insertion_sort`.
   
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `sort` operation relies on `get_top_n` and `insertion_sort`, but the latter is not provided. This is a logical gap in the implementation.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as empty stacks or stacks with fewer elements than required for operations like `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. For example, `swap` expects at least two elements in the stack, but no checks are in place to prevent errors if the stack is smaller.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Implement `insertion_sort`**: Complete the `sort` operation by implementing the `insertion_sort` predicate or using a built-in sorting mechanism if available in ProbLog.

2. **Test the `sort` Operation**: Add test cases for the `sort` operation to ensure it works correctly once implemented.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Add checks to ensure operations like `swap`, `over`, and `rot` fail gracefully or provide meaningful feedback when the stack does not have enough elements. For example:
   ```prolog
   stack_op(swap, [X,Y|Rest], [Y,X|Rest]) :- length([X,Y|Rest], L), L >= 2.
   ```

4. **Document Assumptions**: Clearly document any assumptions about stack sizes or input validity to guide users of the code.

5. **Expand Test Coverage**: Include test cases for edge scenarios (e.g., empty stacks, single-element stacks) to ensure robustness.
