{"HASH": "9BA21093", "ErrorSummary": "Repetitive parse/2 predicates for each operator; missing error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs; potential floating-point precision issues with fixed threshold in almost_equal/2", "SuggestedFix": "Refactor parse/2 predicates into a single predicate with a helper function (apply_operator/4) to handle operator logic. Add error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs. Make the threshold in almost_equal/2 configurable.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
