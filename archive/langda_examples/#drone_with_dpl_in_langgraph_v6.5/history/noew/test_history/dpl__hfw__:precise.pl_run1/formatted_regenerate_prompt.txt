### Evaluation Report

#### **Overall_Analysis**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse a list of symbols representing numbers and arithmetic operations, then evaluate the expression. The test case `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` correctly evaluates to `-0.25`, which matches the expected result. This indicates that the core logic of the `parse/2` predicate and the arithmetic operations are functioning as intended. However, there are minor structural and stylistic issues that could be improved for robustness and clarity.

#### **Error_Summary**
1. **Structural Issue**:
   - The `parse/2` predicate for handling division (`/`) includes a check for division by zero (`R1 =\= 0`), but the error handling is minimal. If division by zero occurs, the predicate will simply fail without providing meaningful feedback.

2. **Stylistic Issue**:
   - The `almost_equal/2` predicate is used to handle floating-point comparisons, but its implementation could be more robust. For example, it does not account for cases where `Y` is already a float but not ground.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle invalid input (e.g., lists with incorrect operator placement or unrecognized symbols). For example, `[image_2, image_plus, image_plus, image_3]` would not be caught as invalid.

4. **Redundancy**:
   - The `detect_all/2` predicate is redundant for single-element lists (`[N]`), as it could be handled directly by `parse/2`.

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Enhance the division rule to provide a meaningful error message or propagate a specific failure reason when division by zero occurs. For example:
     ```prolog
     parse([N1, / | T], R) :-
         parse(T, R1),
         (R1 =\= 0 -> almost_equal(N1 / R1, R) ; throw(error(division_by_zero, _)).
     ```

2. **Refine `almost_equal/2`**:
   - Extend the `almost_equal/2` predicate to handle cases where `Y` is already a float but not ground. For example:
     ```prolog
     almost_equal(X, Y) :-
         (ground(Y) -> abs(X - Y) < 0.0001 ;
         (var(Y) -> Y is float(X) ;
         Y =:= float(X)).
     ```

3. **Add Input Validation**:
   - Introduce a validation step in `detect_all/2` to ensure the input list alternates between numbers and operators. For example:
     ```prolog
     detect_all([N], [N2]) :- 
         detect_number(N, N2).
     detect_all([N, O | T], [N2, O2 | T2]) :- 
         detect_number(N, N2), 
         detect_operator(O, O2), 
         detect_all(T, T2).
     detect_all(_, _) :- 
         throw(error(invalid_input_format, _)).
     ```

4. **Simplify Redundant Rules**:
   - Remove the redundant `detect_all([N], [N2])` rule and handle single-element lists directly in `parse/2`.

5. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Add test cases for invalid inputs (e.g., lists with consecutive operators or numbers) to ensure the code handles them gracefully.

By implementing these recommendations, the code will be more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
