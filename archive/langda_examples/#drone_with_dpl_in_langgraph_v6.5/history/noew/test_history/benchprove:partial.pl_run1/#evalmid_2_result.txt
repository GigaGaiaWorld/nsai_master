### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code aims to implement a meta-interpreter for logical constructs, including implications, opposites, expansions, and set operations. However, the code fails during parsing with the error "Expected binary operator," indicating a syntax issue. The overall structure of the code is logical, but the error suggests a problem with the way certain constructs are written, particularly in the `implies` predicate.

### Error Summary
1. **Error Location**: The error occurs at line 22:3 in the code, specifically in the `implies` predicate definition.
   - **Root Cause**: The syntax for the `implies` predicate is incorrect. The line `<Code_Block>(\+ prove(P)) ; prove(Q).</Code_Block>` is not valid ProbLog syntax. The use of parentheses and the semicolon (`;`) for disjunction is not properly formatted for ProbLog's parser.

2. **Additional Observations**:
   - The `opposite` and `refute` predicates use `\+` (negation-as-failure), which is supported in ProbLog, but their implementation should be verified for correctness.
   - The `expand` and `extend` predicates are correctly implemented but should be tested for edge cases.

### Recommendations
1. **Fix the `implies` Predicate**:
   - Replace the problematic line with valid ProbLog syntax for disjunction. For example:
     ```prolog
     prove(implies(P, Q)) :-
         (\+ prove(P)) ; prove(Q).
     ```
   - Ensure proper spacing and parentheses alignment to avoid parser errors.

2. **Test the Fixed Code**:
   - After fixing the `implies` predicate, rerun the test cases to verify that the error is resolved and the logic works as intended.

3. **Verify Other Predicates**:
   - Test the `opposite`, `refute`, `expand`, and `extend` predicates with additional edge cases to ensure robustness.

4. **Consult ProbLog Documentation**:
   - Refer to the ProbLog documentation for supported syntax and control constructs to avoid similar issues in the future.

By addressing these issues, the code should parse and execute correctly, fulfilling the intended requirements.
