Here is the evaluation of each `<langda>` code module in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "F91C6038", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found", "SuggestedFix": "None needed", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
```

```report
{"HASH": "A8860BE4", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found", "SuggestedFix": "None needed", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
```

```report
{"HASH": "702CD838", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found", "SuggestedFix": "None needed", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
```

```report
{"HASH": "57FD427B", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found", "SuggestedFix": "None needed", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0DE8749E", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found", "SuggestedFix": "None needed", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
```

### Notes:
1. The parsing error ("Ambiguous token role") likely stems from the **overall structure** of the ProbLog code (e.g., misplaced commas, incorrect predicate formatting, or unsupported syntax) rather than any individual `<langda>` block. The error occurs at line 42, which is outside the evaluated modules.
2. The `<langda>` blocks themselves are syntactically correct and fulfill their respective requirements (digit constraints, sum rules, uniqueness checks).
3. To resolve the overarching error, inspect the **connective syntax** between modules (e.g., commas, parentheses, or predicate headers) and ensure the `query_sum` predicate is properly formatted. The error is not module-specific.

### Suggested Global Fix:
- Review the `query_sum` predicate's structure (e.g., ensure commas are correctly placed, no extraneous symbols exist).
- Validate that the ProbLog parser supports the entire clause as written. The error suggests a token conflict, possibly due to an unsupported operator or malformed rule.
