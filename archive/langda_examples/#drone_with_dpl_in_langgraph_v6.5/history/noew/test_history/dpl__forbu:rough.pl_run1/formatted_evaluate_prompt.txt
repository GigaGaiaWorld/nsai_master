<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

 Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'append/3' at 9:6.
</Result>

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to implement a bubblesort algorithm, but it fails during execution due to an undefined predicate `append/3`. The code structure is logically sound for a Prolog implementation, but it does not account for ProbLog's restricted subset of Prolog predicates. The test results indicate that the `append/3` predicate is not recognized, which is a critical issue in ProbLog.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Undefined Predicate Error**: The error message `No clauses found for 'append/3'` indicates that the `append/3` predicate is not available in ProbLog. This is the root cause of the failure.
   - **Location**: The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate where `append/3` is called to concatenate lists.
   - **Root Cause**: ProbLog does not support the `append/3` predicate by default, as it is part of Prolog's standard library but not included in ProbLog's restricted predicate set.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace `append/3` with a ProbLog-Compatible Alternative**:
   - Implement a custom `append/3` predicate in ProbLog. For example:
     ```prolog
     append([], L, L).
     append([H|T], L, [H|R]) :- append(T, L, R).
     ```
   - Alternatively, use ProbLog's built-in list manipulation predicates if available (e.g., `lists:append/3` if the `lists` module is supported).

2. **Verify Predicate Support**:
   - Ensure all predicates used in the code are supported by ProbLog. Refer to the [ProbLog documentation](https://problog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prolog.html) for a list of supported predicates.

3. **Test the Custom Implementation**:
   - After replacing `append/3`, retest the code to ensure the bubblesort algorithm works as expected.

4. **Consider ProbLog's Limitations**:
   - Avoid using Prolog-specific features like cuts (`!/0`) or if-then-else constructs, as they are not supported in ProbLog.

5. **Documentation Review**:
   - Review the [ProbLog documentation](https://problog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for additional guidance on supported predicates and best practices.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if itâ€™s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
