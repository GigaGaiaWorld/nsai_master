<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code aims to model the Monty Hall problem, but it fails during execution due to an unsupported control construct (`if-then-else`). The error indicates that the `->` operator is not supported in ProbLog, which aligns with the syntax notes provided. The code also lacks proper handling of the `open_door/1` predicate as per the requirements.

### Error Summary
1. **Unsupported Control Construct**: The `if-then-else` construct (`N = 2 -> random_member(Door, Doors) ; Doors = [Door]`) is not supported in ProbLog. This is the root cause of the error message: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2'`.
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `open_door/1` predicate does not fully adhere to the requirements. Specifically, it does not explicitly handle the two cases (random selection between two doors or opening the only available door) as described in the requirements.
3. **Missing Probabilistic Handling**: The `win_switch` predicate uses `\+ open_door(A)`, which is not a valid way to check if a door was not opened. ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic or deterministic handling of such conditions.

### Recommendations
1. **Replace `if-then-else` with Supported Constructs**:
   - Use a disjunction (`;`) to simulate the `if-then-else` behavior. For example:
     ```prolog
     open_door(Door) :-
         select_door(Selected),
         findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), Doors),
         length(Doors, N),
         (N = 2, random_member(Door, Doors) ; N = 1, Doors = [Door]).
     ```

2. **Clarify `open_door/1` Logic**:
   - Ensure the predicate explicitly handles the two cases:
     - If there are two doors, randomly select one.
     - If there is only one door, open it.

3. **Fix `win_switch` Predicate**:
   - Replace `\+ open_door(A)` with a deterministic check or probabilistic condition that aligns with ProbLog's semantics. For example, you might need to explicitly model the door-opening process and its implications.

4. **Test and Validate**:
   - After making the changes, test the code to ensure it behaves as expected for both cases (two doors and one door).

5. **Refer to ProbLog Documentation**:
   - For further clarification on supported constructs, refer to the ProbLog documentation or tutorials on control predicates and deterministic rules.

By addressing these issues, the code should correctly model the Monty Hall problem and execute without errors.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if itâ€™s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
