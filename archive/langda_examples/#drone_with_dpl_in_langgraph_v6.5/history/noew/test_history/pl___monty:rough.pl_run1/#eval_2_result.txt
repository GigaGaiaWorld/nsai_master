  "HASH": "55F6DA26",
  "ErrorSummary": "Logical redundancy in checking for two doors, incomplete handling of edge cases, and missing explicit uniform random selection when two doors are available.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Refactor `open_door/1` into two clauses: one for when two doors are available (choose one uniformly at random) and another for when only one door is available (open that door). Use `findall/3` to collect available doors and `random_member/2` for random selection. Example:\n```prolog\nopen_door(Door) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \\= Selected), Doors),\n    length(Doors, N),\n    (N = 2 -> random_member(Door, Doors) ; Doors = [Door]).\n```",
