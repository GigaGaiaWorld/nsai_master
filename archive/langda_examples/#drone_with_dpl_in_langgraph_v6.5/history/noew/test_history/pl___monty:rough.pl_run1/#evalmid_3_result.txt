### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code aims to model the Monty Hall problem, but it fails during execution due to an unsupported control construct (`if-then-else`). The error indicates that the `->` operator is not supported in ProbLog, which aligns with the syntax notes provided. The code also lacks proper handling of the `open_door/1` predicate as per the requirements.

### Error Summary
1. **Unsupported Control Construct**: The `if-then-else` construct (`N = 2 -> random_member(Door, Doors) ; Doors = [Door]`) is not supported in ProbLog. This is the root cause of the error message: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2'`.
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `open_door/1` predicate does not fully adhere to the requirements. Specifically, it does not explicitly handle the two cases (random selection between two doors or opening the only available door) as described in the requirements.
3. **Missing Probabilistic Handling**: The `win_switch` predicate uses `\+ open_door(A)`, which is not a valid way to check if a door was not opened. ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic or deterministic handling of such conditions.

### Recommendations
1. **Replace `if-then-else` with Supported Constructs**:
   - Use a disjunction (`;`) to simulate the `if-then-else` behavior. For example:
     ```prolog
     open_door(Door) :-
         select_door(Selected),
         findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), Doors),
         length(Doors, N),
         (N = 2, random_member(Door, Doors) ; N = 1, Doors = [Door]).
     ```

2. **Clarify `open_door/1` Logic**:
   - Ensure the predicate explicitly handles the two cases:
     - If there are two doors, randomly select one.
     - If there is only one door, open it.

3. **Fix `win_switch` Predicate**:
   - Replace `\+ open_door(A)` with a deterministic check or probabilistic condition that aligns with ProbLog's semantics. For example, you might need to explicitly model the door-opening process and its implications.

4. **Test and Validate**:
   - After making the changes, test the code to ensure it behaves as expected for both cases (two doors and one door).

5. **Refer to ProbLog Documentation**:
   - For further clarification on supported constructs, refer to the ProbLog documentation or tutorials on control predicates and deterministic rules.

By addressing these issues, the code should correctly model the Monty Hall problem and execute without errors.
