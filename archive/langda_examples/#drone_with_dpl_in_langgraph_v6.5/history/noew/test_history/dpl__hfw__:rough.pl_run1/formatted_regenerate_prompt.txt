 % Problog Inference Resultï¼š

</Result>
<Analysis>
### Overall Analysis
The provided code aims to parse a list of symbols (numbers and operators) into a mathematical expression and evaluate it. However, the test result shows that the query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` fails, returning `0.0000`. This indicates that the code does not correctly handle the parsing and evaluation of the expression.

### Error Summary
1. **Missing Parse Predicates**: The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It only defines rules for addition (`+`) and single numbers. The requirements specify that all four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) must be supported, but the code lacks rules for subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

2. **Incorrect Evaluation**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate is used to handle floating-point comparisons, but the `parse/2` rules do not correctly propagate the results of intermediate calculations. For example, the division operation (`/`) is not defined, leading to the failure of the query.

3. **Structural Issue**: The `parse/2` predicate does not recursively handle nested operations (e.g., `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`). The current implementation only handles a single operation at a time, which is insufficient for complex expressions.

### Recommendations
1. **Define All Parse Rules**: Add the missing `parse/2` rules for subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`). For example:
   ```prolog
   parse([N1, -, N2 | T], R) :-
       almost_equal(N1, X),
       parse([N2 | T], Y),
       R is X - Y.
   
   parse([N1, *, N2 | T], R) :-
       almost_equal(N1, X),
       parse([N2 | T], Y),
       R is X * Y.
   
   parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :-
       almost_equal(N1, X),
       parse([N2 | T], Y),
       Y =\= 0,  % Avoid division by zero
       R is X / Y.
   ```

2. **Recursive Parsing**: Ensure the `parse/2` predicate recursively evaluates the entire list of symbols. The current implementation stops after the first operation, which is incorrect for multi-operation expressions.

3. **Test Cases**: Add test cases to verify the correctness of each operation and combinations of operations. For example:
   ```prolog
   % Test addition
   query(expression([image_2, image_plus, image_3], X)).  % Expected: 5.0
   
   % Test division and addition
   query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3], X)).  % Expected: 3.6667
   ```

4. **Error Handling**: Add checks for division by zero and other edge cases to ensure robustness.

By implementing these fixes, the code should correctly parse and evaluate mathematical expressions as required.

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>
