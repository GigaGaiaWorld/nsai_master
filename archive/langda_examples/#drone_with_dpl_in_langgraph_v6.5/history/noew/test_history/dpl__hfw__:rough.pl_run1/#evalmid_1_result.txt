### Overall Analysis
The provided code aims to parse a list of symbols (numbers and operators) into a mathematical expression and evaluate it. However, the test result shows that the query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` fails, returning `0.0000`. This indicates that the code does not correctly handle the parsing and evaluation of the expression.

### Error Summary
1. **Missing Parse Predicates**: The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It only handles the case for a single number (`parse([N], R)`) and addition (`parse([N1, +, N2 | T], R)`). The requirements specify that all four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) must be supported, but the code lacks predicates for subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Incorrect Evaluation**: The test case involves a complex expression with multiple operations (`2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`), but the code fails to evaluate it correctly. This is due to the missing parse rules for operations other than addition.

3. **Logical Flow**: The `parse/2` predicate does not account for operator precedence or associativity, which is critical for evaluating mathematical expressions correctly. For example, multiplication and division should be evaluated before addition and subtraction.

### Recommendations
1. **Complete the `parse/2` Predicate**: Add separate `parse/2` predicates for subtraction, multiplication, and division, similar to the addition rule. For example:
   ```prolog
   parse([N1, -, N2 | T], R) :-
       almost_equal(N1, X),
       parse([N2 | T], Y),
       R is X - Y.

   parse([N1, *, N2 | T], R) :-
       almost_equal(N1, X),
       parse([N2 | T], Y),
       R is X * Y.

   parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :-
       almost_equal(N1, X),
       parse([N2 | T], Y),
       R is X / Y.
   ```

2. **Handle Operator Precedence**: To correctly evaluate expressions like `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, the code should first parse and evaluate higher-precedence operations (multiplication and division) before lower-precedence ones (addition and subtraction). This may require restructuring the `parse/2` predicates or using a more sophisticated parsing approach (e.g., recursive descent parsing).

3. **Test Incrementally**: Test the code with simpler expressions first (e.g., `2 + 3`, `4 * 5`) to ensure each operation works correctly before moving to more complex expressions.

4. **Debugging**: Use debugging tools or print statements to trace the execution of the `parse/2` predicate and identify where the evaluation fails.

By addressing these issues, the code should correctly parse and evaluate mathematical expressions as required.
