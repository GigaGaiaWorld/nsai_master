<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code for the Zebra puzzle is well-structured and adheres to the logical constraints of the puzzle. The test result indicates that the code successfully solves the puzzle, producing the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes. The predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and used to enforce the puzzle's constraints. The code meets the requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of ProbLog's declarative semantics.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code or the test results. The solution correctly satisfies all the given constraints of the Zebra puzzle, as evidenced by the output:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Clarity**: While the code is functional, adding comments to explain the purpose of each constraint could improve readability for others reviewing the code.
2. **Testing Edge Cases**: Although the current test case passes, consider testing additional edge cases or variations of the puzzle to ensure robustness.
3. **Documentation**: Document the predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) in a header comment to clarify their roles in the solution.
4. **Performance**: If the puzzle were scaled up (e.g., more houses or attributes), the current approach might become inefficient. Consider optimizing the predicates for larger datasets if needed.
