  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to improve upon the original by adding checks for unique pairs (C1 @< C2) and using floating-point division for better precision. However, it contains a syntax error (an extra '.' after the density predicate) which makes it invalid. The original code runs successfully and produces correct results, while the generated code fails to run due to the syntax error. The logic changes in the generated code (like the density comparison) could potentially produce different results if the syntax error were fixed, but we can't verify this due to the current invalidity."
