  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same functionality for detecting numbers and operators, parsing expressions, and evaluating mathematical operations. However, there is a minor formatting issue in the 'detect_all' predicate where the line breaks and indentation are inconsistent. Despite this, the logic remains intact and the code produces the same result as the original."
