  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues compared to the original code. First, the 'carrying' predicate is simplified and misses important conditions like checking the action 'do(pickup(key),T)' and handling the case when the robot puts down the key. Second, the 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))' predicate is missing a clause for when the 'goto' action fails. These changes lead to different probabilities in the results, particularly for 'carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))' and the positions of the key and robot. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results with the original code."
