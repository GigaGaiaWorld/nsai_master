  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect compared to the original code. It lacks the necessary parsing rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, which are present in the original code. The generated code only includes a rule for addition, making it unable to properly evaluate the given query. As a result, the running results are inconsistent, with the generated code failing to compute the correct result."
