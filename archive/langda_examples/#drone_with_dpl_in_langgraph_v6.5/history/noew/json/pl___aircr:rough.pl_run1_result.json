  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the original logic by introducing clamping to the goal position in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate. This change affects the probabilities of reaching the goal and overrun exceptions. While the generated code is syntactically valid and meets basic requirements, it alters the original behavior by preventing overshooting the goal position, which explains the different probabilities in the results. The original code allows for potential overshooting and then checks for legality, while the generated code clamps positions to the goal."
