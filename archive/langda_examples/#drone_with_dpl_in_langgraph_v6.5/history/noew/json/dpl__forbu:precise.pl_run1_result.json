  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the definition of the 'swap' predicate, where the generated code uses 'X > Y' for swap and 'X =< Y' for no_swap, while the original code uses 'X < Y' for no_swap and its negation for swap. This change in logic does not affect the overall behavior of the sorting algorithm."
