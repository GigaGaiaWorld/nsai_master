  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main differences are in formatting and minor syntactic variations, such as the placement of conditions in some predicates. However, these changes do not affect the overall behavior or results of the program. The generated code correctly implements the aircraft flap controller model and produces the same inference results as the original code."
