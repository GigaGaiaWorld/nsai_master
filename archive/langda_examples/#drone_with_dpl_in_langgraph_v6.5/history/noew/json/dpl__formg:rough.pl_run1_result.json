  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm correctly. The generated code uses a different approach for splitting the list, which is more concise and efficient. The base cases and merge logic remain the same. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming the correctness of the generated code."
