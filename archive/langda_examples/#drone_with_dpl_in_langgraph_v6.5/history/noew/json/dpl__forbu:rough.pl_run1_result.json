  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubblesort algorithm similar to the original code but introduces several issues. First, it uses 'append/3' which is not defined in the context, leading to a runtime error. Second, the logic for tracking swaps ('Swapped' flag) is different from the original's hole/swap mechanism. While the structure is similar, the implementation details differ significantly. The original code works correctly while the generated code fails due to the undefined predicate."
