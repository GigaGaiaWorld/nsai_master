  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there is a syntax error in the generated code due to an extra period (.) at the end of the 'query_sum' predicate, which causes a parsing error. The original code runs successfully and produces multiple valid solutions, while the generated code fails to run due to the syntax error. The logic of both codes is intended to solve the same cryptarithmetic problem, but the generated code's syntax error prevents it from executing."
