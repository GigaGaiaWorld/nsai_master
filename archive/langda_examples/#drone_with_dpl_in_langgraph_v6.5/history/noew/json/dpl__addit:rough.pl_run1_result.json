  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle lists of images representing multi-digit numbers and 'multi_addition' to sum these numbers. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as it successfully calculates the sum of two multi-digit numbers represented by lists of images. The result is consistent with the original code's logic but applied to a more complex scenario."
