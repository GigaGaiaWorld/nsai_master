  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same logic as the original code. It correctly models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for the prize and the same rules for door selection and switching. However, the generated code introduces an unnecessary variable 'Selected' in the 'open_door' clauses, which is not used in the body of the rules. Despite this, the generated code produces the same results as the original code, indicating that the core logic remains intact."
