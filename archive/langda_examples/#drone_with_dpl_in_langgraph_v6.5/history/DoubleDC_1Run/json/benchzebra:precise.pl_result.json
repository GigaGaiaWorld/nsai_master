  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the constraints and logic of the original zebra puzzle. The only minor difference is the use of 'snail' instead of 'snails' in the generated code, which does not affect the overall logic or result. The generated code is well-formatted and includes helpful comments for each constraint."
