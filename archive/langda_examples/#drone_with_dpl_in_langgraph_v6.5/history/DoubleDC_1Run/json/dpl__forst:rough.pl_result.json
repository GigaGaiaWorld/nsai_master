  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it lacks the definitions for basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) which were present in the original code. The generated code only includes the sorting operation and its helper predicates. This inconsistency causes the queries to fail, resulting in 0.0000 probabilities for all operations. The generated code's structure for sorting is correct but incomplete without the foundational stack operations."
