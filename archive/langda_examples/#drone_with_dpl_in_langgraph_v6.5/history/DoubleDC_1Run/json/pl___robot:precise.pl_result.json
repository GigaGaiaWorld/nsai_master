  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there are some differences in the 'at' predicate definitions for the robot's position, which affect the results. The generated code lacks the definitions for the 'at' predicate concerning the key's position, leading to incomplete results (missing key position probabilities). This omission causes the 'carrying' probability to be 0.0000, which is incorrect compared to the original result of 0.4331."
