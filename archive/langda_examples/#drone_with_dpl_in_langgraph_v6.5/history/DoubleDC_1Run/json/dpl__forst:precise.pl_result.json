  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot). However, it is incomplete as it misses the implementation of the 'sort' operation and the 'insertion_sort' predicate, which were present in the original code. The running results are consistent for the operations that are implemented, but the 'sort' operation cannot be tested due to its absence in the generated code."
