  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally similar to the original but differs in the parse rules for arithmetic operations. The original code handles operations with proper precedence by parsing recursively, while the generated code processes operations in a left-associative manner without considering operator precedence. This leads to different results for the same query. The generated code is valid in form but produces incorrect results due to improper handling of operator precedence."
