  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog. The generated code uses slightly different predicate names ('insert' instead of 'insert_element') but maintains the same logic and structure. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list with a probability of 1.0000."
