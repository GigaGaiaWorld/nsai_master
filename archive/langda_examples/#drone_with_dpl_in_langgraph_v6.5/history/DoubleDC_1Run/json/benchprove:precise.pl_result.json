  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and structure. However, there is a syntax error in the generated code, specifically in the 'prove(opposite(P))' rule where there is an unexpected tab character ('\\t') before the negation operator ('\\+'). This causes a parsing error during execution. The original code does not have this issue and runs successfully. Other than this syntax error, the generated code would produce the same results as the original code if corrected."
