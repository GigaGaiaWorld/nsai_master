  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same functionality for member/2, the basic meta-interpreter, and extended logic processing. The generated code simplifies the 'implies' definition slightly but maintains equivalent semantics. All other extended logic predicates (opposite, expand, includes, extend, refute) are correctly replicated. The examples and queries are identical to the original, ensuring the same behavior. The running results are completely consistent between both versions."
