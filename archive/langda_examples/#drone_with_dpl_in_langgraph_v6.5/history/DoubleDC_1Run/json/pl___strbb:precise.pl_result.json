The only differences are in formatting (indentation and line breaks) and the renaming of variable 'II' to 'J' in the bb predicate, which does not affect the logic or outcome. The generated code maintains all the key components and logic of the original, including the probabilistic choices, palindrome definition, and evidence/query structure. Both codes produce the same result (bb(5) = 0.3750) when executed."
