  "final_report": "The generated code extends the functionality of the original code by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of images into their corresponding numerical values and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these numbers. The generated code is consistent with the original code's logic but adds more complex functionality. The running results are correct for both codes, with the generated code handling multi-digit numbers as expected."
