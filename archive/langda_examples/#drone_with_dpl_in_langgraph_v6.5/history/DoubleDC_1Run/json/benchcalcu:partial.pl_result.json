  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there are some formatting issues and redundant constraints (repeated leftdigit and digit checks). The main logic for sumdigit and all_different predicates remains correct. The running results differ significantly, with the generated code producing many more solutions, some of which do not satisfy the original problem constraints (e.g., AB + BCD = CDE). This suggests an error in the constraint application in the generated code."
