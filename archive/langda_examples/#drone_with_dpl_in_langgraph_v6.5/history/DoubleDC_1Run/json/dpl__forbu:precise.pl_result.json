  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the definition of the 'swap' predicate. The original code uses negation as failure (\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)) for the swap case, while the generated code directly checks if X > Y. This change does not affect the correctness of the code. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
