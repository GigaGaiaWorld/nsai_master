  "final_report": "The generated code has a syntax error in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate where it uses '=<' with non-ground variables, which is not allowed in Problog. This causes a CallModeError during execution. The original code correctly uses 'sign' function to handle direction. The generated code's logic for position calculation is similar but incorrectly implemented, leading to runtime errors."
