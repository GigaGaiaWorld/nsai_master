  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It maintains the same logic for solving the cryptarithmetic puzzle AB + BCD = CDE. The generated code adds explicit arithmetic verification (AB + BCD =:= CDE) which was implicit in the original code's column-wise addition constraints. Both codes produce identical results, indicating they solve the same problem correctly. The formatting of the generated code is slightly less compact but remains valid."
