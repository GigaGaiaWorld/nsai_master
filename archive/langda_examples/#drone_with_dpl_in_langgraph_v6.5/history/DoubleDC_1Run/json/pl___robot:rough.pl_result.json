  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it modifies the probabilities of several events (pickup_succeeds, drop_slippery_key, fumbles_key, stays_slippery, initially_slippery) without clear justification, which significantly alters the original model's behavior. Second, it simplifies the carrying/2 predicate by removing important conditions (do(pickup(key),T) and do(putdown(key),T)), which affects the logic flow. The running results are inconsistent with the original code, showing carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000 versus 0.4331 in the original, indicating the generated code fails to model the same scenario correctly."
