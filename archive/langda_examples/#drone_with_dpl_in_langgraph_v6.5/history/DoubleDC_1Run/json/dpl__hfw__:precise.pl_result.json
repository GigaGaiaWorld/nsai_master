  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of parsing logic. The original code handles subtraction by converting it into a multiplication with -1, while the generated code directly performs subtraction. This leads to different results for the same input. The generated code's result (-0.25) is incorrect compared to the original code's result (-10.333333333333332). The generated code is syntactically valid but semantically incorrect for the intended purpose."
