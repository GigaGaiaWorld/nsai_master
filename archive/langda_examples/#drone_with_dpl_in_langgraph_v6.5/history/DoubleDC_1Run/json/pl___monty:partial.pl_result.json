  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes correctly model the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes of keeping or switching the choice. The generated code improves clarity by explicitly stating the selected door in the conditions for opening a door, making the logic more transparent. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
