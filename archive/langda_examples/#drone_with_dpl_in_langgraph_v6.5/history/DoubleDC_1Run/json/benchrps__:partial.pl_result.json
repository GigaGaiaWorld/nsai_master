  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for draw cases. The original code correctly updates the score by maintaining the current value (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes Rs directly without maintaining the score (compute_score(Rs, S)). Despite this, the running results are consistent due to the specific test case used."
