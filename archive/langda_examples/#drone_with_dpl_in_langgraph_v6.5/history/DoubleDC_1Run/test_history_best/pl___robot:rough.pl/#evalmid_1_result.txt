### ProbLog and DeepProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves to different locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4812`
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6300`
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities derived from the given rules and probabilistic facts.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned values consistent with the probabilistic rules and facts defined in the code.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `drops/2`, and `at/3` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `slippery/2`) terminate correctly.
- **Recursive Termination:** All recursive predicates have base cases (e.g., `slippery(key,0)`), ensuring termination.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `goto_succeeds/1` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
- **Negation-as-Failure:** The use of `\+` in predicates like `drops/2` correctly models negation in the probabilistic context.

##### **DeepProbLog Features**
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and applied.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable (no list operations).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable (limited to `s(s(s(0)))`).
