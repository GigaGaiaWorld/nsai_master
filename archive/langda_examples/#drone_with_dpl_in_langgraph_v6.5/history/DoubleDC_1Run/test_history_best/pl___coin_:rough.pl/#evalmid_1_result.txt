### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Simulating Coin Tosses**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`P(heads) = 0.8`) `CNT` times and accumulate the number of heads (`S`). The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is used to count the heads, and the query `total(_)` is intended to return the total number of heads after 4 tosses.  

The evaluation focuses on:  
- Verifying the correctness of the probabilistic and recursive logic.  
- Identifying errors in the implementation.  
- Ensuring compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a **non-ground probabilistic clause** error. Specifically:  
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Error:** `NonGroundProbabilisticClause` at line 1:5.  

**Failed Queries:**  
- `query(total(_))` (No results returned due to error).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate:** `make_coin(C, PH)`  
  - **Line:** 1  
  - **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C, PH)` is non-ground because `PH` is unbound. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be ground (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for counting heads.  
- Termination is ensured because `CNT` decrements to 0.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The error arises because `PH::make_coin(C, PH)` violates ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground.  
- The correct form should bind `PH` to a probability value (e.g., `0.8::make_coin(C)`).  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the probabilistic fact is invalid).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic clause.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not relevant here.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursion:** No performance issues for small `CNT`.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground probabilistic clause | Prevents execution of the query | Replace `PH::make_coin(C, PH)` with `0.8::make_coin(C)`. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic fact. Correcting this by grounding the probability value will resolve the issue. The recursive logic for counting heads is otherwise sound. No DeepProbLog features are used.
