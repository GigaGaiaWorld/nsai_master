### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door, and the contestant decides whether to switch or stay.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- All probabilities are consistent with the expected behavior of the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The code correctly implements the following:  
1. **Probabilistic Facts:**  
   - `prize/1` distributes the prize equally among doors (1/3 probability each).  
   - `select_door(1)` is deterministic (probability 1.0).  
2. **Rules:**  
   - `open_door/1` and `open_door/2` handle the host's behavior when one or two doors are available to open.  
   - `win_keep` and `win_switch` compute the probabilities of winning by staying or switching.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list membership.  
  - Recursion in `member/2` terminates as expected.  
- **Negation-as-Failure:**  
  - `\+` is used correctly to exclude selected or prize-containing doors.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - `prize/1` and `open_door/1` comply with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
  - The host's choice (`open_door/1` and `open_door/2`) adheres to fairness (50% probability when two doors are available).  
- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Feature not used.**

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement               | Met? | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning       | Yes  | Correct use of Prolog predicates and recursion.                             |
| Probabilistic Reasoning   | Yes  | Probabilities align with the Monty Hall problem.                            |
| Neural Network Integration| No   | DeepProbLog features (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used.                   |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input is a list (e.g., `[1,2,3]`).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue here due to small input size.
