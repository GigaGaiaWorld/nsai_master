#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition ProbLog Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptarithmetic puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The code ensures that:  
- All digits are unique.  
- The first digit of any multi-digit number is non-zero.  
- The arithmetic constraints of the addition are satisfied.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the test results.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each query returns a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the constraints are satisfied for these digit assignments.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- **`leftdigit/1`**: Ensures non-zero first digits.  
- **`sumdigit/5`**: Correctly simulates column addition with carry.  
- **`all_different/1`**: Ensures uniqueness of digits.  

All predicates are logically sound and terminate correctly.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The code adheres to Prolog's logical constraints. Recursive predicates like `all_different/1` terminate correctly.  
- Arithmetic operations (`sumdigit/5`) are deterministic and correctly handle carry propagation.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (0-9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal (5 digits), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is logically correct and passes all provided tests. No modifications are required. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic constraints or neural network integration if needed.
