### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the solution.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Executed**: `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result**: 
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**: All constraints are satisfied in the output.
- **Conclusion**: **All tests passed (no failures)**. The solution correctly adheres to the puzzle's requirements.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. All predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the output matches the expected solution.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are logically sound and terminate correctly.
- **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) terminate as they reduce the problem size with each call.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: No probabilistic facts are used in this implementation. The solution is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Features**: **Not used**. The code does not integrate neural networks or probabilistic reasoning beyond basic constraints.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog constraints.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates**: None.
- **Non-list Input**: The input is explicitly structured as a list of houses, avoiding runtime errors.
- **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited to the number of houses (5), ensuring performance is not an issue.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is robust and correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle using classical Prolog constraints. No issues were identified in the code or its execution. For future enhancements, consider integrating probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features to explore more complex scenarios.
