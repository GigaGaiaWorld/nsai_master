<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extending it with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the extended predicates.  
- Analyze test results and identify failures.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and logical semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an unsupported construct in ProbLog:  
- **Error:** `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 16:47`.  
- **Failed Query:** `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))`.  
- **Other Queries:** Not executed due to the failure.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `implies/2` (line 16).  
- **Root Cause:** The `->` (if-then) operator is not supported in ProbLog.  
- **Expected Behavior:** The query should succeed if `Goal1` implies `Goal2`.  
- **Actual Behavior:** The query fails due to unsupported syntax.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `implies/2` predicate uses `->`, which is not allowed in ProbLog.  
  - ProbLog supports `\+` (negation) and `,` (conjunction), but not imperative control constructs like `->`.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - ProbLog requires declarative semantics. The `->` operator breaks this by introducing imperative control.  
  - Alternatives like `(prove(Goal1), prove(Goal2)) ; \+ prove(Goal1)` should be used.  
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (failed due to `implies/2`).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not tested due to failure.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features).  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` rules for some terms.  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` could cause errors.  
  - Deep recursion in `member/2` may impact performance for large lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` in `implies/2` | Query fails | Replace with `(prove(Goal1), prove(Goal2)) ; \+ prove(Goal1)` |
| 2   | Untested edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs) | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation or documentation. |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features | Limited functionality | Consider integrating neural predicates if needed. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**  
1. Replace `implies/2` with a ProbLog-compatible implementation.  
2. Add test cases for edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs).  
3. Document unsupported features (e.g., `->`).  

**Word Count:** 450  

--- 

**Final Note:** The code is logically sound but requires adjustments for ProbLog compatibility. Addressing the `implies/2` issue will resolve the primary failure.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
