  "HASH": "418D2062",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core merge sort logic. The implementation correctly handles the provided test case and adheres to the merge sort algorithm. However, lacks input validation for non-list inputs and may have performance issues with very large lists.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation to ensure the input is a list. 2. Optimize for large lists by using tail recursion or iterative methods if performance is critical.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
