### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, which is then tested in a ProbLog environment. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's constraints.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed with a probability of 1.0000, indicating perfect correctness for the given input.  
  **Output**: "All tests passed (no failures)."  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` function as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined.  
  - The recursive splitting and merging logic adheres to the merge sort algorithm.  
- **Termination**:  
  - The recursion terminates because the list is split into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

##### **ProbLog Analysis**  
- **Probabilistic Compliance**:  
  - The result probability of 1.0000 confirms deterministic behavior, which is expected for classical Prolog predicates in ProbLog.  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used, so no further probabilistic checks are required.  

##### **DeepProbLog Analysis**  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The merge sort algorithm is correctly implemented.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs will fail silently or raise errors.  
- **Performance**:  
  - The implementation is not optimized for large lists due to the use of `length/2` and recursive splitting.  
  - For very large lists, stack overflow may occur.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation. |
| 2      | Performance for large lists | Stack overflow risk | Optimize with tail recursion or iterative methods. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and performance optimizations. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
