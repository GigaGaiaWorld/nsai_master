### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000, as `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a net score of -1 for `player1`.

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. All predicates and rules function as intended. Below is a summary of the key predicates and their correctness:

| Predicate/Rule          | Functionality Verified | Status |
|-------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| `move/1`                | Defines valid gestures | Pass   |
| `beats/2`               | Win-lose relationships | Pass   |
| `result/3`              | Game outcome logic     | Pass   |
| `play/3`                | Recursive game play    | Pass   |
| `compute_score/2`       | Score calculation      | Pass   |
| `determine_winner/3`    | Final winner logic     | Pass   |

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The code adheres to logical correctness. Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly for empty lists and non-empty lists.
  - The `result/3` predicate correctly handles all edge cases (win, lose, draw).

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code assumes valid inputs (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Non-list inputs or invalid gestures would cause errors.  
  - **Performance**: The recursive implementation is efficient for typical game lengths but may face stack issues for very long lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words  

**Final Remarks**:  
The implementation is robust and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified during testing. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation and exploring probabilistic extensions for more complex game scenarios.
