{
  "HASH": "501F546D",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. The code correctly implements insertion sort in classical Prolog. However, it lacks input validation for non-list inputs and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`) to handle non-list inputs. 2. Consider extending with probabilistic rules if probabilistic sorting is required (e.g., uncertain comparisons).",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
