### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes with the correct sorted output and a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**:  
  The code correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm, and the test query produces the expected result.  
  - **Predicates Verified**:  
    - `insertion_sort/2` (lines 1–3)  
    - `insert/3` (lines 4–6)  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Context**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates correctly when the input list is empty (`[]`).  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The base case (`insertion_sort([], [])`) ensures termination.  

##### **ProbLog Context**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code. The result is deterministic (probability = 1.0000).  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  **Not used** (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...`, or related calls).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement           | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning   | Satisfied   | The code correctly implements insertion sort in classical Prolog.            |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used  | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**:  
  The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem               | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2   | DeepProbLog not used  | Limited to classical reasoning  | Consider extending for probabilistic tasks. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is correct for classical Prolog but lacks features for probabilistic or neural network integration. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness. The code is suitable for deterministic sorting tasks but may require enhancements for broader applications.
