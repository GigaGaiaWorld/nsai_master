problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5. 

***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. The main issue is the use of a non-ground probabilistic clause 'coin(C)' which causes an error during evaluation. The original code correctly uses 'coin(CNT)' within the recursive clause, ensuring the probabilistic clause is properly grounded. The generated code also incorrectly uses 'C' in the conditional statement instead of 'CNT', which further deviates from the original logic. The running results are inconsistent, with the original code producing valid probabilities while the generated code fails to execute.
