The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The generated code simplifies the split_list predicate into a split predicate, which is more efficient as it directly splits the list without using append. The merge and append predicates remain the same in both codes. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their functional equivalence.
