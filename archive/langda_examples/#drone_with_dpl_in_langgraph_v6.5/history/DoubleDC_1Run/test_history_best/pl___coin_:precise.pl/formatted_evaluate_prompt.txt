<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Simulating Coin Tosses**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, where each coin has a probability of 0.8 to land heads. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) as the counter (`CNT`) decrements from 4 to 0. The final result (`S`) should accumulate the total successes.  

The evaluation aims to:  
- Verify the correctness of the code.  
- Identify any syntactic or logical errors.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a syntax error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return self.collapse(string, tokens)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1282, in collapse
    raise UnmatchedCharacter(string, expr_stack[-1].start.location)
problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character '(' at 8:5.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The query `total(_)` could not be executed due to the syntax error.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - The error occurs at line 8, column 5, where an unmatched `(` is detected.  
  - The problematic construct is the `if-then-else` (`->`) in the `coins_r/3` predicate.  

- **Code Block with Error:**  
  ```prolog
  coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
      CNT > 0,
      (coin(CNT) -> 
          NewSC is SC + 1,
          NewCNT is CNT - 1,
          coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT)
      ; 
          NewCNT is CNT - 1,
          coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Syntactic Error:**  
  - ProbLog does not support the `if-then-else` (`->`) construct. This is a Prolog feature that breaks ProbLog's declarative semantics.  

- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic is sound, but the syntax is invalid in ProbLog.  
  - The termination condition (`CNT = 0`) is correctly defined.  

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).` is correctly defined.  
  - The negation/implication rules are not violated, but the unsupported `->` construct prevents execution.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but syntax is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (probabilistic facts are correctly defined).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not relevant here.  
  - **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (`CNT = 4`), so performance is not an issue.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `if-then-else` (`->`) | Code cannot execute             | Replace with ProbLog-compatible constructs (e.g., `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)`). |
| 2   | Unmatched `(`                    | Syntax error                    | Ensure all parentheses are balanced.       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code's logic is sound, but the use of unsupported Prolog constructs (`->`) prevents execution in ProbLog. By replacing the `if-then-else` with ProbLog-compatible alternatives, the code can be corrected. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented, and no DeepProbLog features are required.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
