### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation against the given test case.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.  
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge case handling.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` function as intended:  
- **`insertion_sort/2`** recursively sorts the tail of the list and inserts the head into the sorted tail.  
- **`insert_element/3`** correctly places the element in the sorted list by comparing values.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursion in `insertion_sort/2` terminates when the input list is empty (`[]`), and the `insert_element/3` predicate ensures the correct placement of elements.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` guarantees termination.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved in this query.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...`, or related calls).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement | Status | Explanation |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Classical Reasoning | Met | Correctly implements insertion sort. |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts/rules used. |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Applicable | No DeepProbLog features used. |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists (not tested).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | Deep recursion performance | Stack overflow risk | Optimize for tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

**Final Notes:**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. However, edge cases and performance optimizations should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
