### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under probabilistic actuator selection and wind interference. The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within five time steps. The evaluation verifies the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical termination, and adherence to functional requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with expectations, given the probabilistic nature of actuator selection and wind effects.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The following predicates and rules were verified:  
- **`legal_flap_position/1`**: Correctly restricts flap positions to `0-10`.  
- **`use_actuator/2`**: Probabilistic selection of actuators `a` or `b` with equal probability.  
- **`wind_effect/2`**: Correctly models wind interference based on wind strength.  
- **`attempted_flap_position/2`**: Combines actuator thrust, wind effect, and goal direction.  
- **`goal_reached/1` and `overrun_exception/1`**: Properly evaluate success and exceptions.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2` or non-list inputs are not applicable here.  
  - Deep recursion is avoided due to the fixed time limit (`at(5)`).  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is respected (e.g., `wind(weak)` and `wind(strong)` are complementary).  
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)` is implicitly handled by ProbLog’s inference engine.  
- **Negation-as-Failure**: Used correctly in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification**: No neural predicates (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Logical rules correctly model flap movement and goal checking.              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met      | Probabilities for actuators and wind effects are correctly computed.        |
| Neural Network Integration | N/A    | Not applicable in this example.                                            |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates**: Not an issue; all predicates are defined.  
- **Non-List Inputs**: Not applicable.  
- **Performance**: Fixed time steps prevent deep recursion.
