<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The logic includes:  
- Defining the three gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
- Specifying the win-lose relationships (`beats/2`).  
- Calculating the result of each round (`result/3`).  
- Recursively playing multiple rounds (`play/3`).  
- Computing the final score (`compute_score/2`).  
- Determining the winner (`determine_winner/3`).  

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
1. Verify the correctness of the logic.  
2. Analyze the test results.  
3. Identify any failures or edge cases.  
4. Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  `query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).`  

- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```  
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for '->'/2 at 41:77.  
  ```  

- **Interpretation**:  
  The error indicates that the `if-then-else` construct (`->/2`) is not supported in ProbLog, which is confirmed by the syntax notes.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.  

- **Error Location**:  
  The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically the use of `->/2` (line 41).  

- **Root Cause**:  
  ProbLog does not support the `if-then-else` construct (`->/2`). This is a syntactic limitation of ProbLog, which prioritizes declarative semantics over imperative control.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The logic for `result/3`, `play/3`, and `compute_score/2` is correct and adheres to Prolog's declarative style. Recursive termination is properly handled.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is involved. The error is purely syntactic.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. The code is purely classical.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met (except for the `->/2` issue).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code handles empty lists and draws correctly.  
  - Non-list inputs or malformed moves (e.g., `[rock, foo]`) are not explicitly checked but would fail gracefully due to `move/1` constraints.  

- **Suggestions**:  
  Replace the `if-then-else` construct with a supported alternative, such as:  
  ```prolog  
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-  
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),  
      compute_score(Results, Score),  
      (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1';  
       Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2';  
       Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').  
  ```  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|-----|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` in ProbLog | Test failure | Replace with `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)` |  
| 2   | No probabilistic facts/rules | N/A | Add probabilistic rules if needed |  
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features | N/A | Report as "DeepProbLog not used" |  

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**  
The code is logically sound but requires minor syntactic adjustments to comply with ProbLog's limitations. The error is easily fixable, and the core functionality (classical reasoning) is intact. No probabilistic or neural network features are used.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
