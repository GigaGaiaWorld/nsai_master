### **Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The logic includes:  
- Defining the three gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
- Specifying the win-lose relationships (`beats/2`).  
- Calculating the result of each round (`result/3`).  
- Recursively playing multiple rounds (`play/3`).  
- Computing the final score (`compute_score/2`).  
- Determining the winner (`determine_winner/3`).  

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
1. Verify the correctness of the logic.  
2. Analyze the test results.  
3. Identify any failures or edge cases.  
4. Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  `query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).`  

- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```  
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for '->'/2 at 41:77.  
  ```  

- **Interpretation**:  
  The error indicates that the `if-then-else` construct (`->/2`) is not supported in ProbLog, which is confirmed by the syntax notes.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.  

- **Error Location**:  
  The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically the use of `->/2` (line 41).  

- **Root Cause**:  
  ProbLog does not support the `if-then-else` construct (`->/2`). This is a syntactic limitation of ProbLog, which prioritizes declarative semantics over imperative control.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The logic for `result/3`, `play/3`, and `compute_score/2` is correct and adheres to Prolog's declarative style. Recursive termination is properly handled.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is involved. The error is purely syntactic.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. The code is purely classical.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met (except for the `->/2` issue).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code handles empty lists and draws correctly.  
  - Non-list inputs or malformed moves (e.g., `[rock, foo]`) are not explicitly checked but would fail gracefully due to `move/1` constraints.  

- **Suggestions**:  
  Replace the `if-then-else` construct with a supported alternative, such as:  
  ```prolog  
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-  
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),  
      compute_score(Results, Score),  
      (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1';  
       Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2';  
       Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').  
  ```  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|-----|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` in ProbLog | Test failure | Replace with `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)` |  
| 2   | No probabilistic facts/rules | N/A | Add probabilistic rules if needed |  
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features | N/A | Report as "DeepProbLog not used" |  

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**  
The code is logically sound but requires minor syntactic adjustments to comply with ProbLog's limitations. The error is easily fixable, and the core functionality (classical reasoning) is intact. No probabilistic or neural network features are used.
