### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, adherence to probabilistic rules, and functional requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a player selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The player can then choose to switch doors or stay with their initial choice.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries and their results were provided:  

| Query             | Probability Result |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `prize(1)`        | 0.3333             |
| `prize(2)`        | 0.3333             |
| `prize(3)`        | 0.3333             |
| `select_door(1)`  | 1.0000             |
| `win_keep`        | 0.3333             |
| `win_switch`      | 0.6667             |

**Verification:**  
- All results align with the expected probabilities for the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Conclusion:** "All tests passed (no failures)."  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The implementation correctly adheres to the requirements for `open_door/1`:  
1. If two doors are available (neither has a prize nor is selected), Monty opens one uniformly at random.  
2. If only one door is available (no prize and not selected), Monty must open it.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list membership. The `open_door/1` rule ensures Monty's behavior aligns with the problem's constraints.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate terminates as expected for finite lists.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` is correctly defined.  
- **Negation:** The use of `\+ prize(A)` and `\+ prize(B)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- **Implications:** No explicit implications are used, but the logic ensures correct probabilistic reasoning.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the Monty Hall scenario.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for `win_keep` and `win_switch` are accurate.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this implementation.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list inputs, but no edge cases are tested.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not relevant here due to shallow recursion.

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic rules. No issues were identified, and all test cases passed. The code is concise and efficient for its purpose.
