### **ProbLog and DeepProbLog Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Image-Based Number and Operator Detection**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect numbers and operators from images and perform arithmetic operations. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including classical reasoning, recursive termination, and adherence to probabilistic rules (if applicable). The code also includes a test case for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], -10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The result matches the expected output (`-10.333...`).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, `detect_all/2`, `parse/2`, and `expression/2` are correctly defined and function as intended.  
  - Recursive termination in `detect_all/2` and `parse/2` is ensured by base cases (`detect_all([N], [N2])`) and proper list decomposition.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The predicates correctly map images to numbers/operators and parse arithmetic expressions.  
  - The `almost_equal/2` predicate handles floating-point comparisons robustly.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion in `detect_all/2` and `parse/2` terminates due to proper base cases and list decomposition.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`).  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement           | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning   | Met         | Correctly parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.                     |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                  |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used  | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                      |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs to `detect_all/2` or `parse/2` are not handled (e.g., `detect_all(atom, _)`).  
- **Division by Zero**: Explicitly checked in `parse/2` (`N2 \== 0`).  
- **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for small lists but untested for large inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| No. | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error | Add input validation for `detect_all/2`.   |
| 2   | Deep recursion           | Unverified performance | Test with large input lists.               |

**Final Note**: The code meets its primary requirements but could benefit from additional edge-case handling and performance testing. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
