### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Predicates**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
This report evaluates a ProbLog meta-interpreter with extended logic predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The goal is to verify the correctness of classical and probabilistic reasoning, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
All test queries returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating successful execution:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))`  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))`  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6)`  
- `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))`  
- `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The following predicates were verified:  
- **`implies/2`**: Correctly implements `¬P ∨ Q` (line 12–14).  
- **`opposite/1`**: Correctly implements `¬P` (line 16–18).  
- **`expand/2`**: Correctly evaluates arithmetic (line 20–22).  
- **`includes/2`**: Relies on `member/2` (line 24–25).  
- **`extend/3`**: Correctly prepends elements (line 27–29).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Context**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - Recursive predicates (e.g., `member/2`, `ancestor/2`) terminate and behave as expected.  
  - Negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used correctly in `opposite/1` and `refute/1`.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - `expand/2` fails gracefully for undefined operations (e.g., `expand(double(x),_)`).  
  - `includes/2` handles non-list inputs by failing (e.g., `includes(atom, b)`).  

##### **ProbLog Context**  
- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is satisfied by `opposite/1`.  
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)` is satisfied by `implies/2`.  
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Notes                          |  
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|  
| Classical Reasoning  | ✅ Met      | All predicates work as intended. |  
| Probabilistic Rules  | ✅ Met      | Complies with ProbLog semantics. |  
| Neural Integration   | ❌ Not Used | No DeepProbLog features.        |  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Fails silently (e.g., `expand(square(3),_)`).  
- **Non-list Inputs**: `includes/2` and `extend/3` fail for non-lists.  
- **Deep Recursion**: No performance issues observed for small datasets.
