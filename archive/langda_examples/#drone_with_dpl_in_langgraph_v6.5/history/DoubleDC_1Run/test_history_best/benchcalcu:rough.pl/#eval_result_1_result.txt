  "ErrorSummary": "Timeout during execution due to inefficient search for unique digits and lack of probabilistic constraints.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Optimize `all_different/1` by replacing it with a more efficient constraint (e.g., using `dif/2` or CLP(FD)). 2. Add probabilistic constraints if needed (e.g., probabilistic digit assignments). 3. Add input validation for `query_sum/1` to handle non-list inputs.",
