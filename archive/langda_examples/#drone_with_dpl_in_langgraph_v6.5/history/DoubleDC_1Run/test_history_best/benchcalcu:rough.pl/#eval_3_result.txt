  "ErrorSummary": "Timeout during query execution due to inefficient search space pruning in `all_different` and `sumdigit` constraints.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Replace `all_different` with a more efficient implementation (e.g., using CLP(FD) if available). 2. Add explicit constraints to limit the domain of variables (e.g., `A in 1..9`). 3. Ensure `sumdigit` calls are guarded with ground checks to prevent infinite recursion.",
