<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code aims to solve a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The solution must satisfy constraints such as unique digits and no leading zeros. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the code, identifying failures, and analyzing the root causes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Test Outcome**: **Failure**  
  - The test timed out during execution, indicating a performance or logical issue.  
  - No query results or probabilities were returned due to the timeout.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`  
  - **Error**: Timeout during execution.  
  - **Affected Predicates**:  
    - `sumdigit/5` (lines 15–20): Simulates column addition with carry.  
    - `all_different/1` (lines 10–13): Ensures all digits are unique.  
    - `leftdigit/1` (lines 7–8): Restricts leading digits to non-zero values.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The logic for `sumdigit/5` and `all_different/1` is correct, but the exhaustive search for unique digits may cause inefficiency.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The `all_different/1` predicate uses recursion, which is safe but may slow down for larger digit sets.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Rules**: Not applicable here (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **DeepProbLog Features**: Not used.  

##### **Performance Bottleneck**  
- The timeout suggests the solver is unable to efficiently explore all possible digit combinations due to the constraints.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status       | Explanation                          |  
|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|  
| Classical Reasoning  | Partially Met | Logic is correct, but inefficient.  |  
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Met    | No probabilistic features used.     |  
| Neural Network Integration | Not Met | Not applicable.                     |  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs to `query_sum/1` are not handled.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion in `all_different/1` may cause delays.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| #  | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                          |  
|----|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|  
| 1  | Timeout during execution | No results returned  | Optimize `all_different/1` or use constraints. |  
| 2  | No probabilistic features | Limited functionality | Add probabilistic constraints if needed. |  
| 3  | No input validation      | Potential crashes    | Add checks for input type.          |  

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The code is logically sound but requires optimization to handle the search space efficiently. Probabilistic features are absent, and edge cases need addressing.  

---  

### **Additional Insights from Tools**  
- **ProbLog Limitations**: The tool does not support character manipulation or exception handling predicates, which are irrelevant here.  
- **External Examples**: Cryptoarithmetic puzzles are commonly solved in Prolog using backtracking, but ProbLog's focus on probabilistic reasoning may require adaptation for such problems.  

**Next Steps**:  
1. Optimize the `all_different/1` predicate to reduce computational overhead.  
2. Consider adding probabilistic constraints if the problem requires uncertainty modeling.  
3. Validate inputs to handle edge cases gracefully.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
