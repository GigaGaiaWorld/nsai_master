{"HASH": "35747D5A", "ErrorSummary": "Timeout during query execution due to inefficient search space pruning", "SuggestedFix": "Optimize the `all_different` predicate or use constraint logic programming (CLP) to limit the search space. Add additional constraints to reduce combinations, e.g., enforce that A, B, C are non-zero and distinct early in the query.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
