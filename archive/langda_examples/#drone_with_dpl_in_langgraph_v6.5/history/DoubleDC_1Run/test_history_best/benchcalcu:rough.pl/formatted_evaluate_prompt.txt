<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Cryptoaddition Puzzle Analysis in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptarithmetic Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**  

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code aims to solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle `AB + BCD = CDE` using ProbLog. The puzzle requires assigning unique digits (0-9) to letters such that the arithmetic equation holds. The code defines predicates for digits, constraints for uniqueness, and a `sumdigit` predicate to simulate column-wise addition with carry.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed**: `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`.  
- **Result**: The test timed out (`TimeoutError`), indicating the query did not complete within the expected timeframe.  
- **Conclusion**: The test failed due to a timeout, suggesting inefficiency or non-termination in the logic.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`.  
- **Root Cause**: The timeout suggests the query may be stuck in an infinite loop or is computationally too intensive.  
- **Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
      leftdigit(A),
      leftdigit(B),
      leftdigit(C),
      digit(D),
      digit(E),
      all_different([A,B,C,D,E]),
      sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Cout1),
      sumdigit(Cout1, A, C, D, Cout2),
      sumdigit(Cout2, B, 0, C, _).
  ```  
- **Potential Issues**:  
  - The `all_different` predicate may not efficiently prune the search space.  
  - The `sumdigit` calls might not handle all edge cases (e.g., invalid carry values).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `sumdigit` predicate is logically correct but may not terminate if the constraints are too loose.  
  - The `all_different` predicate is correct but inefficient for large domains.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code. The problem is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic is sound, but the implementation is inefficient.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - The `all_different` predicate may not scale well for larger puzzles.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|--------|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1      | Timeout during query execution | Test failure | Optimize `all_different` or limit the search space. |  
| 2      | Inefficient search | Poor performance | Use constraint logic programming (CLP) for better pruning. |  
| 3      | No probabilistic features | N/A | Not applicable for this problem. |  

---

#### **8. Recommendations**  
- **Optimize `all_different`**: Use built-in constraints or libraries for better performance.  
- **Limit Search Space**: Add additional constraints to reduce the number of combinations.  
- **Debugging**: Test smaller sub-problems to isolate the issue.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Code Blocks and Tables**: Included as per instructions.  

**Final Note**: The code is logically correct but requires optimization to avoid timeouts.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
