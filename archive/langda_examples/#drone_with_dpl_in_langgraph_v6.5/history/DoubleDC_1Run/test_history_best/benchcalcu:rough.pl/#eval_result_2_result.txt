  "HASH": "35747D5A",
  "ErrorSummary": "Timeout during execution due to inefficient search for unique digits and lack of probabilistic constraints.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Optimize `all_different/1` by replacing it with a more efficient constraint solver or using built-in predicates like `fd_all_different` in Prolog. 2. Add probabilistic constraints if needed (e.g., `prob::digit(D, P)`). 3. Add input validation for `query_sum/1` to ensure the input is a list of variables.",
