<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the game rules and logic.  
- Analyze the test results for accuracy.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.  
- Identify potential edge cases or logical flaws.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query and its results are as follows:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```  
**Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player2) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],draw) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player1) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0.  
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to incorrect probability distribution.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Query:**  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```  
**Issue:**  
- The `determine_winner/3` predicate incorrectly assigns a probability of 1.0 to all outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`), which is logically impossible.  
- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), 
      compute_score(Results,S), 
      ( S > 0, Winner = player1 
      ; S < 0, Winner = player2 
      ; S = 0, Winner = draw 
      ).
  ```  
  - The issue arises because the predicate does not account for probabilistic reasoning. It deterministically assigns outcomes without considering the probabilistic nature of ProbLog.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- The logic for determining the winner (`play_round/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/3`) is correct in a deterministic setting.  
- Recursive termination is ensured for all predicates (`play/3`, `compute_score/3`).  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The code does not adhere to ProbLog's probabilistic rules. Specifically:  
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate should return a single outcome with a probability of 1.0, not multiple outcomes.  
  - The current implementation conflates deterministic and probabilistic reasoning.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The game rules and logic are correctly implemented.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The code fails to handle probabilities correctly.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists of moves. Non-list inputs will cause errors.  
- **Undefined Moves:** The code does not handle invalid moves (e.g., `move(foo)`).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for long move lists could impact performance.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|-----|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1   | Incorrect probability distribution in `determine_winner/3` | Logical inconsistency | Modify the predicate to return a single outcome with probability 1.0. |  
| 2   | No handling of invalid moves | Runtime errors | Add validation for moves. |  
| 3   | Non-list input not handled | Runtime errors | Add input validation. |  

---  

**Word Count:** 450 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code requires modifications to comply with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules and to handle edge cases.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
