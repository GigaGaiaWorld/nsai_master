  "ErrorSummary": "Incorrect probability distribution in `determine_winner/3`; all outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) are assigned probability 1.0, violating probabilistic rules.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify `determine_winner/3` to return a single deterministic outcome (e.g., `Winner = player2` with probability 1.0 for the given test case). Alternatively, restructure the code to use ProbLog's probabilistic predicates (e.g., `prob::/2`) if probabilistic reasoning is intended.",
