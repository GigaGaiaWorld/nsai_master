</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to specified requirements, and ensure it handles both classical and probabilistic scenarios appropriately. The evaluation also checks for edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed with the expected output. The sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` was correctly returned with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The implementation correctly adheres to the requirements:  
  1. The length of the list (`Len`) is calculated to determine whether to split.  
  2. Recursive boundary conditions are properly handled (lists of length 0 or 1 are already sorted).  
  3. The list is split into two parts (`Left` and `Right`) for recursive processing.  

  All auxiliary predicates (`split_list`, `merge`, and `append`) are correctly defined and function as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The merge sort algorithm is logically sound. The recursive calls to `merge_sort` terminate because the list is split into smaller sublists until the base cases (`[]` or `[X]`) are reached.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion terminates correctly due to the boundary conditions (`Len > 1`).  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  The test case does not involve probabilistic facts or negations. However, the implementation is compatible with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  **DeepProbLog feature not used.** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not explicitly tested, but the structure is compatible with ProbLog's probabilistic extensions.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion for very large lists may cause stack overflow, though this is unlikely in typical ProbLog use cases.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used or required.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation checks.        |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow         | Optimize for tail recursion if needed. |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words  

**Final Remarks**:  
The merge sort implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. While it does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features or DeepProbLog, it is a robust implementation for deterministic sorting. Addressing edge cases like non-list inputs would further improve its reliability.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
