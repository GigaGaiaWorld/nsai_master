### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to specified requirements, and ensure it handles both classical and probabilistic scenarios appropriately. The evaluation also checks for edge cases and potential failures.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed with the expected output. The sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` was correctly returned with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The implementation correctly adheres to the requirements:  
  1. The length of the list (`Len`) is calculated to determine whether to split.  
  2. Recursive boundary conditions are properly handled (lists of length 0 or 1 are already sorted).  
  3. The list is split into two parts (`Left` and `Right`) for recursive processing.  

  All auxiliary predicates (`split_list`, `merge`, and `append`) are correctly defined and function as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The merge sort algorithm is logically sound. The recursive calls to `merge_sort` terminate because the list is split into smaller sublists until the base cases (`[]` or `[X]`) are reached.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion terminates correctly due to the boundary conditions (`Len > 1`).  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  The test case does not involve probabilistic facts or negations. However, the implementation is compatible with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  **DeepProbLog feature not used.** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not explicitly tested, but the structure is compatible with ProbLog's probabilistic extensions.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion for very large lists may cause stack overflow, though this is unlikely in typical ProbLog use cases.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used or required.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation checks.        |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow         | Optimize for tail recursion if needed. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words  

**Final Remarks**:  
The merge sort implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. While it does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features or DeepProbLog, it is a robust implementation for deterministic sorting. Addressing edge cases like non-list inputs would further improve its reliability.
