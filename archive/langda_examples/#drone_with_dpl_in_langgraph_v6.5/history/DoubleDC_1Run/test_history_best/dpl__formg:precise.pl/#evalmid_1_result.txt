### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Merge Sort Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify any errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic constraints.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`.  
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:  
  ```  
  Error evaluating Problog model: Ambiguous token role at 6:1.  
  ```  
- **Expected Output**: A sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`.  
- **Error Location**: The error occurs at line 6, column 1, indicating a syntax issue in the ProbLog parser.  
- **Root Cause**: The parser encountered an ambiguous token, likely due to incorrect syntax or unsupported constructs in ProbLog.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The merge sort logic (splitting, merging, and recursion) is correct in Prolog. However, ProbLog has stricter syntax rules.  
  - The error suggests the parser cannot resolve the token at the specified location, possibly due to unsupported Prolog constructs (e.g., cuts or if-then-else).  

- **Probabilistic Compliance**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic violations are present.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used.  

- **Syntax Issues**:  
  - ProbLog does not support certain Prolog constructs (e.g., `!/0`, `->/2`). The error may stem from such unsupported syntax.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but fails due to syntax).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: Not handled (e.g., `merge_sort(123, X)` would fail).  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for typical list sizes.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |  
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| 1   | Ambiguous token role     | Parser cannot proceed           | Check for unsupported Prolog constructs.   |  
| 2   | No probabilistic rules   | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic facts if needed.         |  
| 3   | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error         | Add input validation.                      |  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The merge sort implementation is logically sound but fails due to a syntax issue in ProbLog. The error suggests an unsupported construct or ambiguous token. To resolve this:  
1. Review ProbLog's supported syntax and modify the code accordingly.  
2. Add input validation for edge cases.  
3. Consider adding probabilistic features if required.
