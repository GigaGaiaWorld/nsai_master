### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under probabilistic conditions (actuator selection, wind effects) and checks for goal achievement or overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure the logical flow adheres to the requirements.
- Analyze edge cases and potential failures.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries are as follows:

| Query                 | Probability Result |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`     | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`     | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`     | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`     | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`     | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)`| 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)`| 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)`| 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)`| 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)`| 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, given the probabilistic facts and rules.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic computations are consistent with the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates (`legal_flap_position`, `actuator_strength`, `flap_position`, `overrun_exception`, `goal_reached`) are logically sound. The recursive termination is ensured by the condition `Time > 0` and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.
- **Edge Cases:** The system handles edge cases such as illegal flap positions (e.g., `overrun_exception`) and ensures termination by limiting the steps to 5 (`at(5)`).

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `use_actuator`, `wind`, and `wind_effect` are correctly defined and comply with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
- **Negation/Implication:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` and implications in the rules are correctly implemented.

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code. The system relies solely on classical and probabilistic reasoning.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The system correctly models the flap movement and checks for goal achievement.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities for actuator selection and wind effects are correctly computed.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the code.
- **Non-list Input:** The system does not handle list inputs, but this is not required.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, ensuring performance is not an issue.

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | No failures detected | N/A | N/A |
