### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 steps, checking for goal achievement or overrun exceptions.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code fails to execute due to a **ParseError** at line 31:16, indicating an **"Expected binary operator"** error. This prevents any queries from being evaluated.  

**Failed Queries:**  
- `goal_reached(T)`  
- `overrun_exception(T)`  

**Error Message:**  
```plaintext
ParseError: Expected binary operator at 31:16.
```

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate, specifically at the line where the predicate definition is incomplete (line 31). The code snippet breaks off mid-definition, missing the body of the rule.  

**Affected Code Block:**  
```prolog
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
 Time > 0,
 Prev is Time-1,
 % Missing body here
```

**Root Cause:**  
The predicate is syntactically incomplete, lacking the necessary conditions to compute the new flap position based on the actuator, wind effect, and previous position.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The predicate `attempted_flap_position/2` is logically incomplete. It does not define how the new position (`Pos`) is derived from the previous position, actuator choice, and wind effect.  
- Recursive termination is not verified due to the incomplete predicate.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilistic facts (`wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`) are correctly defined, but their integration into the flap position calculation is missing.  
- No violations of probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are observed in the existing code.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Not used** in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (incomplete predicate).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly modeled for wind and actuator selection, but not integrated into the flap movement logic.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Undefined `attempted_flap_position/2` leads to runtime errors.  
- Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not tested due to the early failure.

| 1   | Incomplete predicate definition  | Code fails to execute           | Complete the `attempted_flap_position/2` rule to compute the new position. |
| 2   | Missing binary operator          | Syntax error                    | Ensure all predicates are syntactically complete and operators are valid.   |

**Word Count:** 450  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Complete the `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate to include logic for calculating the new flap position.  
2. Re-run the queries to verify probabilistic outcomes and edge cases.  

**Final Note:**  
The error is purely syntactic and does not reflect logical flaws in the probabilistic modeling. Fixing the incomplete predicate will enable further testing.
