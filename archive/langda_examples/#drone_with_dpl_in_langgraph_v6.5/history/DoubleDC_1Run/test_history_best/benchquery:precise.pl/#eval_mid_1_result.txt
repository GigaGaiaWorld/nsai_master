### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population density. The code uses deterministic rules and arithmetic constraints to avoid floating-point division, adhering to the requirements of the task. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, analyzing test results, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate the following successful queries:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the code correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population density, as defined by the inequality constraints.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the arithmetic constraints (`20 * D1 < 21 * D2`, etc.) function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `density/2` predicate calculates the integer population density using floor division, as required.  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the two countries are distinct (`C1 \= C2`) and their densities are approximately equal (within 5%).  

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The code does not use probabilistic features (e.g., probabilistic facts or rules). It is purely deterministic.  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code handles edge cases such as countries with zero area (though none exist in the provided data).  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates are not applicable here, as the input format is fixed.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements deterministic Prolog rules.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code is robust against the provided data. However, it assumes that `pop/2` and `area/2` facts are complete and correct. Missing data could lead to incorrect results.
