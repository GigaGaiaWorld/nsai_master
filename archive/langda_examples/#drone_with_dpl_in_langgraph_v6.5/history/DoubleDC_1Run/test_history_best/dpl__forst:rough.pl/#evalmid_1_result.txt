### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])` | Passed | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | Failed | 0.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | Failed | 0.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | Failed | 0.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | Failed | 0.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | Failed | 0.0000 |

**Conclusion**: Only the `push` operation passed. All other operations failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Queries**:  
  - `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`  
- **Root Cause**:  
  - The code only defines `stack_op` for `push` and `sort`. The other operations (`pop`, `dup`, etc.) are not implemented.  
  - **Code Line**: The issue spans the entire code block where these operations are missing.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The `push` operation is correctly implemented, but the absence of definitions for other operations leads to failures.  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here as the operations are not recursive.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The probabilistic results (`0.0000` for failed queries) indicate that the operations are not defined, not that they are probabilistically invalid.  
  - No probabilistic facts or implications are violated, as the issue is purely syntactic.  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used**.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (only `push` works).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined operations (`pop`, `dup`, etc.) are not handled.  
  - No performance issues observed, but the lack of implementation is a critical oversight.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing `pop` implementation | High | Implement `pop` as `stack_op(pop, [X|Rest], Rest).` |
| 2   | Missing `dup` implementation | High | Implement `dup` as `stack_op(dup, [X|Rest], [X,X|Rest]).` |
| 3   | Missing `swap` implementation | High | Implement `swap` as `stack_op(swap, [X,Y|Rest], [Y,X|Rest]).` |
| 4   | Missing `over` implementation | High | Implement `over` as `stack_op(over, [X,Y|Rest], [Y,X,Y|Rest]).` |
| 5   | Missing `rot` implementation | High | Implement `rot` as `stack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Rest], [Z,X,Y|Rest]).` |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires significant expansion to meet the functional requirements. The missing operations must be implemented, and edge cases should be tested.
