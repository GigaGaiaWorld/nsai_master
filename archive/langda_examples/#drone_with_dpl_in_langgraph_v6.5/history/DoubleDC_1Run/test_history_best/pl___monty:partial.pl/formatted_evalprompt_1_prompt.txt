</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**ProbLog Code Evaluation: Monty Hall Problem Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to simulate the scenario where a contestant selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The contestant then decides whether to keep their original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door. The code includes probabilistic facts and rules to model this scenario.

The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Identify and resolve syntax and logical errors.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a **ParseError** due to an **Operator priority clash** at line 8, column 29. This error prevents the code from being executed, and no query results are available.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: None (code fails to parse).
- **Error Location**: Line 8, column 29.
- **Problematic Code**:
  ```prolog
  0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
  ```
- **Issue**: The syntax for probabilistic disjunction is incorrect. ProbLog does not support direct probabilistic weights (`0.5::`) in the middle of a disjunction (`;`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**: The logical structure of the rules is sound, but the syntax for probabilistic disjunction is invalid.
- **ProbLog Context**: 
  - The error arises because ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be defined separately from logical rules. The correct approach is to define probabilistic facts first and then use them in deterministic rules.
  - Example of correct syntax:
    ```prolog
    0.5::open_door_a.
    0.5::open_door_b.
    open_door(A) ; open_door(B) :- open_door_a, open_door_b.
    ```
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logical rules are correct, but syntax is invalid).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to syntax error.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code does not handle cases where the host's door-opening rules are ambiguous (e.g., multiple valid doors to open).
  - Recursive performance is not an issue here, but the syntax error must be resolved first.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Operator priority clash          | Code fails to parse             | Separate probabilistic facts from logical rules. Use correct ProbLog syntax. |
| 2   | Invalid probabilistic disjunction | Probabilistic reasoning broken  | Define probabilistic facts (`::`) separately and use them in deterministic rules. |

---

### **Final Recommendations**
1. **Fix Syntax**: Separate probabilistic facts and logical rules. For example:
   ```prolog
   0.5::open_door_a.
   0.5::open_door_b.
   open_door(A) ; open_door(B) :- open_door_a, open_door_b.
   ```
2. **Test Queries**: After fixing the syntax, verify the queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) to ensure correct probabilistic outcomes.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Explicitly define the host's behavior when multiple doors are valid for opening.

**Word Count**: 450 words.

This report provides a clear path to resolve the issues and improve the code's functionality. Let me know if you'd like further assistance!

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
