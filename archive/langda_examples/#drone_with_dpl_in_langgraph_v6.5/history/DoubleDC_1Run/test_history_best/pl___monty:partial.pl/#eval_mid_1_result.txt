### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Monty Hall Problem**

#### **1. Document Title**
**ProbLog Code Evaluation: Monty Hall Problem Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to simulate the scenario where a contestant selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The contestant then decides whether to keep their original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door. The code includes probabilistic facts and rules to model this scenario.

The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Identify and resolve syntax and logical errors.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a **ParseError** due to an **Operator priority clash** at line 8, column 29. This error prevents the code from being executed, and no query results are available.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: None (code fails to parse).
- **Error Location**: Line 8, column 29.
- **Problematic Code**:
  ```prolog
  0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
  ```
- **Issue**: The syntax for probabilistic disjunction is incorrect. ProbLog does not support direct probabilistic weights (`0.5::`) in the middle of a disjunction (`;`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**: The logical structure of the rules is sound, but the syntax for probabilistic disjunction is invalid.
- **ProbLog Context**: 
  - The error arises because ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be defined separately from logical rules. The correct approach is to define probabilistic facts first and then use them in deterministic rules.
  - Example of correct syntax:
    ```prolog
    0.5::open_door_a.
    0.5::open_door_b.
    open_door(A) ; open_door(B) :- open_door_a, open_door_b.
    ```
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logical rules are correct, but syntax is invalid).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to syntax error.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code does not handle cases where the host's door-opening rules are ambiguous (e.g., multiple valid doors to open).
  - Recursive performance is not an issue here, but the syntax error must be resolved first.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Operator priority clash          | Code fails to parse             | Separate probabilistic facts from logical rules. Use correct ProbLog syntax. |
| 2   | Invalid probabilistic disjunction | Probabilistic reasoning broken  | Define probabilistic facts (`::`) separately and use them in deterministic rules. |

---

### **Final Recommendations**
1. **Fix Syntax**: Separate probabilistic facts and logical rules. For example:
   ```prolog
   0.5::open_door_a.
   0.5::open_door_b.
   open_door(A) ; open_door(B) :- open_door_a, open_door_b.
   ```
2. **Test Queries**: After fixing the syntax, verify the queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) to ensure correct probabilistic outcomes.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Explicitly define the host's behavior when multiple doors are valid for opening.

**Word Count**: 450 words.
