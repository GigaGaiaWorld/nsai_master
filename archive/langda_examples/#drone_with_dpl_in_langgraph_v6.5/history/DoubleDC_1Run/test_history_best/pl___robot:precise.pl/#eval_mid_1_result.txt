### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a robot's actions (e.g., picking up a key, moving) and their probabilistic outcomes (e.g., success/failure of actions). The purpose is to evaluate the logical and probabilistic correctness of the code, verify test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.4331  
- `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.9000  
- `at(robot, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0900  
- `at(robot, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0100  
- `at(key, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.5670  
- `at(key, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.4330  
- `at(key, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0000  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilistic outcomes based on the defined rules and facts.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts adhere to ProbLog's semantics.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates (`carrying/2`, `at/3`, etc.) are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the base case (`s(0)`) and proper negation handling (`\+`).  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as:  
  - No `goto` action (`\+ goto_action(T)`).  
  - Key not being carried (`\+ carrying(key, s(T))`).  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`) comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
- **Negation:** Negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used correctly, and probabilistic implications (e.g., `drops/2`) are properly modeled.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and their deterministic outcomes.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined and computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are called.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable (no list operations).  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable (limited to `s(s(s(0)))`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**  
The code is well-structured, logically correct, and adheres to ProbLog's probabilistic rules. No issues were identified during testing. For future enhancements, consider integrating DeepProbLog for neural-symbolic tasks if needed.
