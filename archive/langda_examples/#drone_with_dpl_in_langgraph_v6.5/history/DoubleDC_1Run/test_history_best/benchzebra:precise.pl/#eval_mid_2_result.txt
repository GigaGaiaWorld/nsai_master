### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The goal of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of the `member/2` predicate in the ProbLog environment. The error message is:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`  
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at the first use of `member/2` in the code (line 4).  
- **Impact:** The entire puzzle-solving logic fails because `member/2` is a critical predicate for checking list membership.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The `member/2` predicate is a standard Prolog predicate for checking list membership. However, ProbLog does not inherently support all Prolog built-ins, including `member/2`.  
  - The error arises because the predicate is not defined in the ProbLog environment or imported from a library.  

- **ProbLog Context:**  
  - ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's predicates and does not include `member/2` by default.  
  - The solution requires either:  
    1. Defining `member/2` explicitly in the ProbLog code.  
    2. Importing a library that provides `member/2` (e.g., the `lists` module in ProbLog).  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents successful execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here, as the puzzle is deterministic.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code assumes the `member/2` predicate is available, which is not the case in ProbLog.  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not handled, but these are not relevant to the current failure.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| **No.** | **Problem**               | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Missing `member/2` predicate | Entire puzzle logic fails           | Define `member/2` explicitly or import the `lists` module in ProbLog.          |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. **Define `member/2`:**  
   Add the following definition to the code:  
   ```prolog
   member(X, [X|_]).
   member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
   ```

2. **Use ProbLog Libraries:**  
   If the `lists` module is available in ProbLog, import it to access `member/2`.

3. **Test Again:**  
   After resolving the `member/2` issue, re-run the query to verify the puzzle logic.
