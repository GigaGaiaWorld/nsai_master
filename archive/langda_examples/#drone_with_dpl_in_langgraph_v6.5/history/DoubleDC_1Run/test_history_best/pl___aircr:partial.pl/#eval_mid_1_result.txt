### **Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap movement, with queries to determine the probability of reaching a goal position or encountering an overrun exception. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000          |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030          |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110          |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127          |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114          |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low but non-zero.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts and queries adhere to ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `legal_flap_position/1`  
- `actuator_strength/2`  
- `use_actuator/2` (probabilistic)  
- `wind/1` and `wind_effect/2` (probabilistic)  
- `flap_position/2`, `overrun_exception/1`, and `goal_reached/1` (deterministic)  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `flap_position/2` and `overrun_exception/1` correctly handle the legality of flap positions. Recursive termination is ensured by the base case (`flap_position(0,6)`).  
- **Edge Cases:** The system handles edge cases such as illegal flap positions (e.g., negative or >10) by triggering `overrun_exception/1`.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `use_actuator/2`, `wind/1`, and `wind_effect/2` comply with ProbLog's rules (e.g., probabilities sum to 1 for mutually exclusive outcomes).  
- **Negation/Implication:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The deterministic rules correctly model the flap controller's behavior.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic facts and rules accurately simulate actuator selection and wind effects.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** None detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), ensuring performance is not an issue.
