#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle that involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on:
- Logical correctness and recursive termination.
- Compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules.
- Verification of test results and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**  
  The test result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle. All constraints are satisfied, and the probability of the solution is 1.0000, indicating certainty.

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.**  
  The implementation correctly adheres to the puzzle's constraints and produces the expected output.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The predicates `my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3` are correctly defined and terminate properly. Recursion is well-handled, and no infinite loops are possible.
- **Termination:**  
  All recursive predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`) terminate when the list is exhausted.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  The puzzle does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic calculations (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are involved.
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Satisfied   | The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.                      |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates:**  
  All required predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are defined.
- **Non-list Input:**  
  The code assumes input is a list of houses. Non-list inputs would fail, but this is not a requirement for the puzzle.
- **Deep Recursion:**  
  The recursion depth is limited to the length of the list (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and robust, passing all tests without failures. The code adheres to classical Prolog semantics and does not require probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Edge cases are well-handled, and the solution is efficient for the given problem size.
