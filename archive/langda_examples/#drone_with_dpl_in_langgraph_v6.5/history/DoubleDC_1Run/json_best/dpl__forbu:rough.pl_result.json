  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and produces the same result as the original code. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'swap' predicate, where the generated code uses a different approach but achieves the same functionality. The generated code is more concise and directly swaps values based on comparison, while the original code uses an additional parameter to indicate swap/no_swap. Both versions correctly implement the bubble sort algorithm and yield identical sorted lists."
