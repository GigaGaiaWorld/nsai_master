  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It maintains all the essential components of the original code, including the meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, and example queries. The formatting and spacing differences are minimal and do not affect the code's execution or results. Both codes produce identical run results, confirming their equivalence."
