  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. However, there is a minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for the 'draw' case. The original code correctly updates the score by maintaining the current score (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes Rs directly without updating the score (compute_score(Rs, S)). Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output for the given query."
