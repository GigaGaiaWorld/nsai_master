  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the constraints and logic of the original zebra puzzle solution. The only difference is the implementation of the 'next_to' predicate, which in the generated code is defined in terms of 'right_of', making it more concise while preserving the same functionality. Both codes produce identical results, solving the puzzle correctly."
