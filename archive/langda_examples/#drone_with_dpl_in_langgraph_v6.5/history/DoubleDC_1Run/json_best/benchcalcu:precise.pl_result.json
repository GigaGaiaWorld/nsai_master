  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it has formatting issues such as unnecessary line breaks and spaces, which do not affect functionality but reduce readability. The main problem is that the generated code results in a timeout error when executed, unlike the original code which produces valid results. This suggests there might be an issue with the implementation or the constraints in the generated code."
