  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic and produces the same results as the original code. The main difference is in the 'open_door' predicate, where the generated code uses a more concise formulation while maintaining the same probabilistic behavior. Both versions correctly show a 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice and a 2/3 chance by switching doors. The generated code is valid and equivalent in functionality to the original."
