  "final_report": "The generated code is syntactically correct and follows the structure of the original code. However, there is a significant difference in the parsing logic for subtraction and division operations. The original code handles subtraction by converting it into a multiplication with -1, while the generated code directly performs subtraction. This leads to different results for the same query. The generated code's result (-0.25) is incorrect compared to the original code's result (-10.333333333333332)."
