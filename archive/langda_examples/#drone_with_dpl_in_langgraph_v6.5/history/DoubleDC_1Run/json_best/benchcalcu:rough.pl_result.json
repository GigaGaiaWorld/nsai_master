  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. Both codes aim to solve the same cryptoaddition problem with similar predicates and constraints. However, the generated code has minor formatting issues, such as inconsistent spacing and line breaks, which do not affect functionality. The main issue is that the generated code resulted in a timeout error during execution, unlike the original code which produced valid results. This suggests a potential problem with the generated code's efficiency or correctness in handling the constraints."
