  "final_report": "The generated code extends the functionality of the original code by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to perform addition on these numbers. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as it successfully calculates the sum of two multi-digit numbers represented as lists of images. The result is consistent with the original code's logic but applied to a more complex scenario."
