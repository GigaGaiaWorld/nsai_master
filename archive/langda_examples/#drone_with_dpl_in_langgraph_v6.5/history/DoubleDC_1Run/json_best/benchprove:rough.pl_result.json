  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it fails to replicate the functionality of the original code. The main issue lies in the implementation of the 'implies' predicate, which is incorrectly defined outside the 'prove' predicate. Additionally, the generated code lacks several key components from the original, such as the definitions for 'opposite', 'expand', 'includes', 'extend', and 'refute' within the 'prove' predicate. This results in all queries returning 0.0000, indicating failure, whereas the original code correctly returns 1.0000 for all queries."
