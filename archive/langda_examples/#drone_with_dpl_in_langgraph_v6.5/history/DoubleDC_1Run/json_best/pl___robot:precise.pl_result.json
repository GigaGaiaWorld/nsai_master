  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. The logic and structure of the rules and probabilistic facts remain unchanged. The only minor difference is in the formatting of some rules, which does not affect the semantics or execution. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expectations."
