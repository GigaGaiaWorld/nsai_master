  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the rock-paper-scissors game rules and calculate the winner based on the moves provided. The main differences are in the formatting and the naming of the winner ('Player 2' vs 'player2'). The generated code uses 'Player 1', 'Player 2', and 'Draw' with capital letters and spaces, while the original code uses lowercase and no spaces. The logic and results remain the same."
