  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing identical results. The main difference lies in the reformatting of the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, which has been rewritten for clarity but maintains the same logical structure and calculations. The generated code is valid and meets all requirements, as evidenced by the matching inference results."
