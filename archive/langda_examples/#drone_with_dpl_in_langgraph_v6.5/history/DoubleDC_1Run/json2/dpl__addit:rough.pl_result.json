  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' that converts a list of images into a multi-digit number. The 'multi_addition' predicate then performs addition on these multi-digit numbers. This is a logical extension of the original code's concept, maintaining consistency while adding more complex functionality. The generated code is correct and produces the expected result (79 + 312 = 391)."
