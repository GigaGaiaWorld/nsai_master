  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct in terms of syntax and logic, but it introduces a significant issue in the play_round predicate where it uses a disjunction (;) without proper conditions, leading to multiple possible results for the same input. This causes the query to return all possible outcomes (player1, player2, draw) with equal probability, which is incorrect. The original code correctly computes a single deterministic result. The structure and functionality are otherwise consistent with the original code."
