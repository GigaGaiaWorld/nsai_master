  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it introduces additional constraints by explicitly calculating the numerical values of AB, BCD, and CDE and checking their sum, which is not present in the original code. This addition might cause performance issues or timeouts, as indicated by the error message. The original code relies solely on digit-wise addition with carry propagation and uniqueness checks."
