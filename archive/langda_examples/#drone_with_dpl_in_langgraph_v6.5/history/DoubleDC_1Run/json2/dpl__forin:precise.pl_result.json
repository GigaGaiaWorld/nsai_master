  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code. Both implement the insertion sort algorithm correctly. The only differences are minor formatting changes (whitespace and line breaks), which do not affect the logic or execution. The generated code maintains the same predicates and clauses as the original, ensuring consistent behavior."
