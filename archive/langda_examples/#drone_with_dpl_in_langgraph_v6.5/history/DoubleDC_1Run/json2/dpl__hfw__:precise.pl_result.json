  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has some issues. The main problem is in the parse rule for multiplication, where it incorrectly uses 'almost_equal' immediately after the multiplication, which disrupts the parsing flow. Additionally, the generated code's run result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating it failed to compute the correct result, unlike the original code which produced the correct result with a probability of 1.0000."
