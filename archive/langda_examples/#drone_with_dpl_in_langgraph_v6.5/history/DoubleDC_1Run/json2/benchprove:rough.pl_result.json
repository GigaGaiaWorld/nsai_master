  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and structure. However, there is a discrepancy in the result for 'prove(expand(double(3),6))', which returns 0.0000 in the generated code instead of 1.0000 as in the original. This suggests a potential issue with the implementation or execution of the expand/2 rule in the generated code. The rest of the results are consistent, and the code form is valid."
