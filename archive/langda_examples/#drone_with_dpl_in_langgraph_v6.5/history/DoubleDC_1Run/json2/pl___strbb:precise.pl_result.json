  "final_report": "The generated code introduces a helper function `bb_helper` to implement the `bb` predicate, which is a different approach from the original code. While the logic is similar, the implementation differs significantly. The original code uses a simple `between` predicate to check for consecutive 'b's, while the generated code uses recursion with `bb_helper`. The running results are inconsistent, with the generated code producing a higher probability (0.6484) compared to the original (0.3750). This suggests the generated code may not correctly implement the intended logic."
