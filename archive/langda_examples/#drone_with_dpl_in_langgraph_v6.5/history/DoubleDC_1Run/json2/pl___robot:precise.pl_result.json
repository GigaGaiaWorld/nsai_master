  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a significant difference in the results. The original code includes probabilities for the key's location at different positions, while the generated code does not. This suggests that the generated code might be missing some rules or facts related to the key's location. The validity of the generated code's form is acceptable, but the results are not consistent with the original code."
