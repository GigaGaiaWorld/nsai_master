  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the core functionalities of the original, including the meta-interpreter and extended logic processing. The generated code adds some additional expand rules for handling negative numbers and zero, which enhances its functionality without breaking the original behavior. The queries and their results are identical to those in the original code, indicating that the generated code performs as expected."
