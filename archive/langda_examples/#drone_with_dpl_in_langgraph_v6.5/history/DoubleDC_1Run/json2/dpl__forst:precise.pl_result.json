  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot). However, the 'sort' operation is incomplete in the generated code, missing the implementation of 'insertion_sort' and the proper structure for the 'sort' predicate. Despite this, the running results for the provided queries are consistent with the original code, as the incomplete 'sort' operation was not tested in the queries."
