  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define the same digit facts and the addition predicate, which performs the same arithmetic operation. The only difference is the formatting and variable naming in the addition predicate, which does not affect the logic or outcome. The generated code is more spaced out and uses different variable names (A and B instead of X2 and Y2), but this is syntactically valid and does not change the behavior of the program."
