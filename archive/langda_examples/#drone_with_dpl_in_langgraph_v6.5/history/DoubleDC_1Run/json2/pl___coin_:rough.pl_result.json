  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. The main issue is the use of 'heads/1' predicate which is not defined anywhere in the code, leading to a runtime error. The original code uses 'coin/1' to determine the outcome of each coin flip, while the generated code incorrectly attempts to use 'heads/1'. Additionally, the logic for updating the score (NewSC) is different and less clear in the generated code. The generated code fails to run due to the undefined predicate, making it invalid."
