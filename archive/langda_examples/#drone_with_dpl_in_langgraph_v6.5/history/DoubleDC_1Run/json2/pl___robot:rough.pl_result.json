  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues compared to the original code. First, the 'carrying' predicate is incorrectly defined, missing the 'do(pickup(key),T)' condition and incorrectly structured. Second, the probability for 'pickup_succeeds(T)' is redefined as 0.8::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.2::pickup_fails(T), which conflicts with the original 0.7::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.3::pickup_fails(T). Third, the 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))' predicate is missing two clauses present in the original code. These changes lead to incorrect results, as shown by the run result where 'carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))' is 0.0000, which is inconsistent with the original result of 0.4331."
