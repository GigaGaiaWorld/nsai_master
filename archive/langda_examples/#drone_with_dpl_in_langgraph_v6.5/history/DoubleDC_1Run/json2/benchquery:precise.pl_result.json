  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same functionality of querying countries with approximately equal population density. The main differences are: 1) The generated code adds a check 'C1 @< C2' to avoid duplicate pairs, which is an improvement. 2) It simplifies the comparison logic by directly using '20 * D1 < 21 * D2' and '20 * D2 < 21 * D1' instead of using temporary variables. 3) It adds a check 'A > 0' to prevent division by zero, which is a good practice. The running results are consistent with the original code, showing the same country pairs with similar densities."
