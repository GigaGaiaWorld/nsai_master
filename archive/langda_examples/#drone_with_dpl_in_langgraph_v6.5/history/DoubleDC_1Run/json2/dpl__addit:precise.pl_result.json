  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to perform addition on these numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly processes lists of images representing digits and performs the addition accurately. The running results of both codes are consistent with their respective functionalities: the original code adds single-digit numbers, while the generated code handles multi-digit numbers. There are no apparent problems with the generated code."
