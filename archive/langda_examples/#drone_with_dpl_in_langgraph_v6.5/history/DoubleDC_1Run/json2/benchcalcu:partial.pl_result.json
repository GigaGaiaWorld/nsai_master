  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results. However, it contains redundant conditions (repeated leftdigit and digit checks) and has inconsistent formatting (spacing and line breaks). The logic for cryptarithmetic solving remains correct, but the code quality is lower due to these issues."
