  "final_report": "The generated code has a different parsing logic for mathematical expressions compared to the original code. While the original code correctly handles operator precedence by using recursive parsing with intermediate results, the generated code processes operations left-to-right without proper precedence handling. This leads to incorrect calculation results, as seen in the different outputs (-10.333 vs -0.25). The generated code's form is valid Prolog syntax but fails to implement the correct mathematical evaluation logic."
