<Overall_Analysis>
The provided code aims to convert a list of image identifiers into a number and perform addition on two such numbers. The logic is implemented using recursive predicates and conditional checks. However, the code fails during execution due to the use of unsupported control constructs in ProbLog, specifically the if-then-else (`->`) construct. The overall structure of the code aligns with the requirements, but the implementation violates ProbLog's syntax rules.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Unsupported Control Construct**: The error message indicates that the `->` construct is not supported in ProbLog. This is used in both the `number/3` and `multi_addition/3` predicates.
   - Root Cause: ProbLog does not support imperative control constructs like `->` and `*->`. These must be replaced with declarative alternatives.
2. **Incomplete Predicate**: The `number/3` predicate is incomplete and lacks a base case for handling invalid inputs gracefully.
   - Root Cause: The predicate does not account for cases where the input list contains unrecognized image identifiers.
3. **Test Failure**: The query `multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)` fails because the unsupported `->` construct prevents the code from executing.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace `->` with Declarative Alternatives**:
   - Use `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)` instead of `Condition -> Action ; Alternative`.
   - Example for `number/3`:
     ```prolog
     number([H|T], Acc, Result) :-
         (digit(H, Nr),
          NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr,
          number(T, NewAcc, Result))
         ; Result = invalid.
     ```
   - Example for `multi_addition/3`:
     ```prolog
     multi_addition(X, Y, Z) :-
         number(X, XNum),
         number(Y, YNum),
         (XNum \= invalid, YNum \= invalid,
          Z is XNum + YNum)
         ; Z = invalid.
     ```

2. **Add Base Case for Invalid Inputs**:
   - Ensure the `number/3` predicate handles cases where the input list contains unrecognized images by explicitly checking for `digit/2` success.

3. **Test the Revised Code**:
   - After replacing the unsupported constructs, test the predicates with valid and invalid inputs to ensure correctness.

4. **Documentation Review**:
   - Refer to the ProbLog documentation for supported control predicates and adhere to them strictly in future implementations.
