{"HASH": "D324979D", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the code block itself, but the overall program fails due to an operator priority clash in the `determine_winner` predicate.", "SuggestedFix": "The `compute_score` block is correct as per requirements. The main fix needed is for the `determine_winner` predicate, which should be completed and properly structured to avoid operator priority issues. Example fix:\n```prolog\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, Score),\n    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ;\n     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ;\n     Winner = draw).\n```", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
