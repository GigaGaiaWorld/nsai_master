Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code.

The <langda> section in origin_code is about the compute_score predicate for the "lose" case, which is already present in the generated code. Here's the formatted JSON:

```problog
{"HASH": "D324979D", "Code": "compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :-\n    compute_score(Rs, S1),\n    S is S1 - 1."}
```
