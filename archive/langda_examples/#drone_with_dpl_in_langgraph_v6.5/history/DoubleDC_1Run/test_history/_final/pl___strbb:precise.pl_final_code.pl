% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,

Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code. The only differences are in formatting (indentation and line breaks) and the renaming of variable 'II' to 'J' in the bb predicate, which does not affect the logic or outcome. The generated code maintains all the key components and logic of the original, including the probabilistic choices, palindrome definition, and evidence/query structure. Both codes produce the same result (bb(5) = 0.3750) when executed.
