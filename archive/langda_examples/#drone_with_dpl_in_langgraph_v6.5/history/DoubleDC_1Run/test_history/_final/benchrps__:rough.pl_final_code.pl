Validity_form:True\Validity_result:False
The generated code is mostly correct in terms of syntax and logic, but it introduces a critical issue in the play_round predicate where it doesn't properly enforce mutual exclusion between the win/lose/draw conditions. This leads to incorrect multiple results for the same input. The original code correctly handles this by separating the result conditions into distinct clauses. While the form of the generated code is valid, its execution produces inconsistent results compared to the original.
