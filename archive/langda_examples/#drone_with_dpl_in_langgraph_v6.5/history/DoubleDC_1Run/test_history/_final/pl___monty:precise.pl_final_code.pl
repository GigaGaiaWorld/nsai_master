The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, with the same probability distributions for prize placement and door selection. The main differences are in the structure of the 'open_door' rules, where the generated code adds 'select_door(Selected)' and slightly modifies the conditions. However, these changes do not affect the overall logic or results. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming the correctness of the generated code.
