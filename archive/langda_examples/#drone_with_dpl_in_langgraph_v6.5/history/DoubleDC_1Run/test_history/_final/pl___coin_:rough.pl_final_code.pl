problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5. 

***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause by using 'coin(C)' without properly grounding the variable C. This leads to an error during execution. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic choice by using 'coin(CNT)' within the recursive call, ensuring proper grounding. The generated code also changes the logic by checking C =:= 1 or C =:= 0, which is not present in the original code and further deviates from the intended behavior.
