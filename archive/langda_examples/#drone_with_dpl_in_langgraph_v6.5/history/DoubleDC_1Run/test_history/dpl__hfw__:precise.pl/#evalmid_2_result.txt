<Overall_Analysis>
The provided code implements a simple arithmetic expression parser in ProbLog, which processes a list of images representing numbers and operators to compute a result. The test case evaluates the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`, and the result `-0.25` is correctly computed, indicating that the core functionality works as intended. However, the code lacks robustness in handling edge cases, such as invalid inputs or more complex nested expressions. The requirements specify that each arithmetic operation should be handled by a separate `parse/2` predicate, which is correctly implemented.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Missing Parentheses Handling**: The code does not account for parentheses in expressions, which are essential for enforcing operator precedence (e.g., `(3 + 3)` in the test case). This is a logical gap in the implementation.
2. **No Input Validation**: The code assumes all inputs are valid images representing numbers or operators. Invalid inputs (e.g., unrecognized images) would cause the program to fail silently or incorrectly.
3. **Limited Error Reporting**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate handles floating-point comparisons but does not provide meaningful error messages for debugging.
4. **No Support for Nested Expressions**: The current implementation does not support deeply nested expressions (e.g., `2 / (3 + (4 * 5))`), as it lacks recursion for sub-expressions.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Add Parentheses Handling**: Extend the `parse/2` predicates to recognize and process parentheses, ensuring correct operator precedence. For example:
   ```prolog
   parse(['(' | T], R) :- parse(T, R1), parse(Rest, R2), R is R1 + R2. % Example for addition
   ```
2. **Implement Input Validation**: Add checks to ensure all inputs are valid before processing. For example:
   ```prolog
   validate_input([N]) :- detect_number(N, _).
   validate_input([N, O | T]) :- detect_number(N, _), detect_operator(O, _), validate_input(T).
   ```
3. **Improve Error Reporting**: Enhance `almost_equal/2` to log mismatches or provide debug information.
4. **Support Nested Expressions**: Modify the `parse/2` predicates to recursively handle sub-expressions within parentheses or other grouping constructs.
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Add test cases for invalid inputs, nested expressions, and edge cases like division by zero.
