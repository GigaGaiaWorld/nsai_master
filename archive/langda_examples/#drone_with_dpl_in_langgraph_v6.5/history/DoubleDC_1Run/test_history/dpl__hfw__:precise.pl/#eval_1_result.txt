{"HASH": "2D3597DC", "ErrorSummary": "The parse/2 predicate does not handle operator precedence or grouping, leading to incorrect evaluation of nested expressions like '2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7'.", "SuggestedFix": "Restructure the parse/2 rules to handle operator precedence (e.g., evaluate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction) and add support for grouping (e.g., parentheses). Consider using an abstract syntax tree or recursive descent parsing for correct evaluation.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
