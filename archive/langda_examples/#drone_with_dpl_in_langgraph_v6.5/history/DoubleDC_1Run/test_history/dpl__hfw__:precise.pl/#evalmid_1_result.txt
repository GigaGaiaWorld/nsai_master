### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (numbers and operators). The test case evaluates the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`, which should yield `-13.666...` but instead returns `-0.25`. This discrepancy indicates a logical error in the parsing or evaluation of the expression. The code structure adheres to the requirements, but the implementation of the `parse/2` predicate does not correctly handle operator precedence or nested expressions.

### Error Summary
1. **Incorrect Evaluation of Operator Precedence**:
   - The `parse/2` rules evaluate operations left-to-right without considering operator precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction). This leads to incorrect results for nested expressions like `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`.

2. **Logical Error in Parsing**:
   - The current implementation does not account for parentheses or grouping in expressions, which is critical for correct evaluation. For example, `(3 + 3)` should be evaluated first, but the code processes it as `3 + 3` without grouping.

3. **Test Case Mismatch**:
   - The test result `-0.25` is incorrect for the given expression. The expected result should be `-13.666...`.

### Recommendations
1. **Implement Operator Precedence**:
   - Modify the `parse/2` predicate to handle operator precedence. For example, evaluate multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. This can be achieved by restructuring the parsing logic or using intermediate representations (e.g., abstract syntax trees).

2. **Support Parentheses or Grouping**:
   - Extend the `detect_all/2` and `parse/2` predicates to recognize and handle parentheses or grouping in the input list. This ensures sub-expressions are evaluated first.

3. **Debugging and Testing**:
   - Add intermediate debugging steps (e.g., printing the parsed symbols or intermediate results) to verify the parsing logic.
   - Test with simpler expressions (e.g., `2 + 3 * 4`) to isolate and fix precedence issues.

4. **Refactor `almost_equal/2`**:
   - Ensure `almost_equal/2` correctly handles floating-point comparisons, especially for division operations where precision is critical.

5. **Documentation and Tool Usage**:
   - Refer to the ProbLog documentation for supported arithmetic operations and parsing techniques. For example, the `retriever_tool` can fetch details on built-in predicates for arithmetic evaluation.

### Example Fix (Partial)
To address operator precedence, you could restructure the `parse/2` rules as follows:
```prolog
parse([N1, * | T], R) :- 
    parse(T, R1), 
    almost_equal(N1 * R1, R).
parse([N1, / | T], R) :- 
    parse(T, R1), 
    almost_equal(N1 / R1, R).
parse([N1, + | T], R) :- 
    parse(T, R1), 
    almost_equal(N1 + R1, R).
parse([N1, - | T], R) :- 
    parse(T, R1), 
    almost_equal(N1 - R1, R).
```
However, this alone won't fix the issue. A more comprehensive solution involving expression grouping or a recursive descent parser is needed.
