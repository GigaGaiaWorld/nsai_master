<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code for the Zebra Puzzle is well-structured and adheres to the logical constraints of the puzzle. The test result indicates that the code successfully solves the puzzle, producing the correct output. The predicates `my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3` are correctly defined and used to enforce the puzzle's constraints. The code meets the requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of ProbLog's declarative semantics.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code. The test result confirms that the solution is correct, and all constraints are satisfied. The predicates are implemented as required, and the logic aligns with the puzzle's rules.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Clarity**: While the code is functional, adding comments to explain the purpose of each constraint could improve readability for others reviewing the code.
2. **Testing Edge Cases**: Although the current test case passes, consider testing edge cases (e.g., empty lists or invalid inputs) to ensure robustness.
3. **Documentation**: Document the predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) in the code to clarify their roles and usage.
4. **Performance**: If the puzzle were scaled to larger sizes, the current implementation might face performance issues. Consider optimizing the predicates for larger datasets if needed.
