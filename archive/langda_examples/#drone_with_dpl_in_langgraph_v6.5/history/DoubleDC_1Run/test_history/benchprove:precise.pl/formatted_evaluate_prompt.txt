<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to implement a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities, including predicates like `implies`, `opposite`, `expand`, `includes`, and `extend`. The code also includes examples and queries to test these predicates. However, the test results indicate a syntax error related to an "Expected binary operator" at line 23:3. This suggests a structural or syntactical issue in the code, likely due to improper use of logical connectives or operators in ProbLog.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **ParseError: Expected binary operator**:
   - **Location**: Line 23:3 in the code.
   - **Root Cause**: The error occurs in the `prove(implies(P,Q))` predicate, where the logical connective `;` (disjunction) is not properly formatted or recognized as a binary operator in ProbLog. ProbLog has strict syntax rules for logical connectives, and the current implementation may violate these rules.
   - **Impact**: The error prevents the code from being parsed and executed, halting further testing of other predicates.

2. **Potential Logical Issues**:
   - The `prove(opposite(P))` predicate uses `\+ prove(P)`, which is correct for negation-as-failure, but the formatting (e.g., indentation or spacing) might need adjustment to avoid ambiguity.
   - The `prove(expand(A,B))` and `prove(extend(List,Elem,Extended))` predicates rely on external definitions (`expand/2` and list operations), which should be verified for correctness.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix the `implies` Predicate**:
   - Ensure the disjunction operator `;` is properly formatted and recognized by ProbLog. For example:
     ```prolog
     prove(implies(P,Q)) :-
         (\+ prove(P)) ; prove(Q).
     ```
     should be written as:
     ```prolog
     prove(implies(P,Q)) :-
         (\+ prove(P) ; prove(Q)).
     ```
   - Alternatively, use a more explicit structure:
     ```prolog
     prove(implies(P,Q)) :-
         (\+ prove(P) -> true ; prove(Q)).
     ```

2. **Verify Logical Connectives**:
   - Refer to ProbLog's supported control predicates (e.g., `;` for disjunction, `,` for conjunction) and ensure they are used correctly. Avoid unsupported constructs like `->` or `*->`.

3. **Check Formatting and Syntax**:
   - Ensure proper indentation and spacing, especially around logical operators and parentheses, to avoid parsing errors.

4. **Test Incrementally**:
   - After fixing the `implies` predicate, test the code incrementally to identify any additional issues in other predicates (e.g., `opposite`, `expand`, `includes`, `extend`).

5. **Consult ProbLog Documentation**:
   - Review the official ProbLog documentation for syntax rules and supported constructs to ensure compliance with the language's requirements.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
