<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

### Evaluation Report

#### **Overall_Analysis**
The provided code implements a `stack_op` predicate for sorting the top 3 elements of a stack using `get_top_n` and `insertion_sort`. However, the test results indicate that all queries (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) returned `0.0000`, suggesting that the predicates for these operations are either missing or incorrectly implemented. The code only partially meets the requirements, as it lacks implementations for the other stack operations mentioned in the test cases.

#### **Error_Summary**
1. **Missing Implementations**:
   - The code does not include predicates for `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, or `rot`. These operations are queried in the test cases but are not defined in the code.
   - The `get_top_n` predicate is implemented but does not handle cases where the stack length is less than `N` correctly (e.g., `Elements = Stack` and `Rest = []` is redundant and could lead to incorrect behavior).

2. **Logical Issues**:
   - The `stack_op` predicate is only defined for the `sort` operation, which explains why all other operations return `0.0000` (they are undefined).
   - The `insertion_sort` predicate is correctly implemented but unused for other operations.

3. **Test Failures**:
   - All test cases (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) failed because their corresponding predicates are missing.

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Implement Missing Stack Operations**:
   - Define predicates for `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` to match the test cases. For example:
     ```prolog
     stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).
     stack_op(pop, [X|Rest], Rest).
     stack_op(dup, [X|Rest], [X,X|Rest]).
     stack_op(swap, [X,Y|Rest], [Y,X|Rest]).
     stack_op(over, [X,Y|Rest], [Y,X,Y|Rest]).
     stack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Rest], [Z,X,Y|Rest]).
     ```

2. **Fix `get_top_n`**:
   - Simplify the `get_top_n` predicate to handle cases where the stack length is less than `N` more elegantly:
     ```prolog
     get_top_n(Stack, N, Elements, Rest) :-
         length(Stack, Len),
         (Len >= N -> length(Elements, N), append(Elements, Rest, Stack)
         ; Elements = Stack, Rest = []).
     ```

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Ensure all implemented operations are tested with edge cases (e.g., empty stack, stack with fewer than `N` elements).

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and its expected inputs/outputs.

By addressing these issues, the code will fully meet the requirements and pass all test cases.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
