<Overall_Analysis>
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`. The test results show that all operations except `sort` work correctly, returning the expected outputs with a probability of 1.0000. The `sort` operation, however, is not tested in the provided results, but its implementation contains a logical issue due to the use of an unsupported `if-then-else` construct in ProbLog. The rest of the code adheres to ProbLog's syntax and requirements.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Unsupported `if-then-else` Construct**:
   - **Location**: The `get_top_n/4` predicate uses the `(Len >= N -> ... ; ...)` construct, which is not supported in ProbLog.
   - **Root Cause**: ProbLog does not support imperative control constructs like `if-then-else`. This breaks the declarative semantics of the language.
   - **Impact**: The `sort` operation will fail or behave unpredictably because the `get_top_n` predicate cannot correctly handle the conditional logic.

2. **Missing Test for `sort` Operation**:
   - **Location**: The test results do not include a query for the `sort` operation.
   - **Root Cause**: The absence of a test case makes it impossible to verify the correctness of the `sort` operation.
   - **Impact**: The functionality of the `sort` operation remains untested and potentially flawed.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace `if-then-else` with ProbLog-Compatible Logic**:
   - Rewrite the `get_top_n/4` predicate using ProbLog-supported constructs like `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)`.
   - Example:
     ```prolog
     get_top_n(Stack, N, Elements, Rest) :-
         length(Stack, Len),
         (Len >= N, length(Elements, N), append(Elements, Rest, Stack)) ;
         (Len < N, Elements = Stack, Rest = []).
     ```

2. **Add Test Cases for `sort` Operation**:
   - Include queries to test the `sort` operation with various stack configurations (e.g., stacks with fewer than 3 elements, exactly 3 elements, and more than 3 elements).
   - Example:
     ```prolog
     query(stack_op(sort, [3, 1, 2, 4], Y)).
     query(stack_op(sort, [1, 2], Y)).
     ```

3. **Verify Correctness of `sort` Logic**:
   - Ensure the `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` predicates work as intended for sorting the top elements of the stack.
   - Test edge cases, such as an empty stack or a stack with duplicate elements.

4. **Document ProbLog-Specific Constraints**:
   - Clearly document any restrictions or alternative constructs used to comply with ProbLog's syntax, especially for future maintenance.
