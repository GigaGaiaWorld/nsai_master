<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Resultï¼š
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6265
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9900
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6846
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3070
</Result>
<Analysis>
<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves it to another location. The test results indicate that the robot successfully carries the key to the target location (`loc2`) with a probability of 0.6265, and the key is at `loc2` with a probability of 0.6846. However, there is also a non-negligible probability (0.3070) that the key remains at `loc1`, suggesting a potential issue in the logic governing the key's movement or retention. The overall code structure adheres to ProbLog's syntax and semantics, but the probabilities in the results reveal inconsistencies that need addressing.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Inconsistent Key Retention**: The key has a significant probability of remaining at `loc1` (0.3070) despite the robot's successful movement to `loc2`. This suggests a flaw in the `carrying/2` or `drops/2` predicates, where the key is not consistently retained by the robot.
   - Root Cause: The `drops/2` predicate may not account for all scenarios where the key could be dropped, or the probabilities assigned to `drop_slippery_key/1` and `fumbles_key/1` may not reflect the intended behavior.

2. **Probability Mismatch**: The probability of `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` (0.6265) is lower than expected, given the high success rate of `goto_succeeds/1` (0.9) and `pickup_succeeds/1` (0.7). This indicates that the combined probabilities of the actions do not align with the desired outcome.
   - Root Cause: The interaction between the probabilities of `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `fumbles_key/1` may not be correctly modeled, leading to unintended lower probabilities.

3. **Redundant Rules**: The `at/3` predicate for the key has overlapping rules that might cause ambiguity in the key's location under certain conditions.
   - Root Cause: The rules for `at(key,Pos,T)` and `at(key,Pos,s(T))` could conflict when the key is neither carried nor dropped, leading to unexpected results.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Refine the `drops/2` Predicate**:
   - Ensure that the `drops/2` predicate covers all possible scenarios where the key could be dropped, including additional conditions like robot actions or environmental factors.
   - Adjust the probabilities of `drop_slippery_key/1` and `fumbles_key/1` to better reflect the intended behavior.

2. **Review Probability Assignments**:
   - Re-evaluate the probabilities assigned to `pickup_succeeds/1`, `goto_succeeds/1`, and other probabilistic facts to ensure they align with the desired outcome. For example, increase the probability of `pickup_succeeds/1` if the key should be retained more often.

3. **Clarify Key Location Rules**:
   - Simplify the rules for `at(key,Pos,T)` and `at(key,Pos,s(T))` to avoid ambiguity. For example, ensure that the key's location is updated only when explicitly carried or dropped.

4. **Add Debugging Queries**:
   - Introduce additional queries to trace the key's state (e.g., `query(slippery(key,T))` or `query(drops(key,T))`) to identify where the logic fails.

5. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Test scenarios where the key is initially slippery or not, and where the robot fails to pick up the key, to ensure the model behaves as expected under all conditions.

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>
</Regenerate_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed code here
```

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
