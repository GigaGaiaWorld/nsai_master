Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code blocks that correspond to the <langda> blocks in the origin_code. Since there's only one <langda> block in the origin_code, I'll provide one JSON entry with the corresponding completed code.

```problog
{"HASH": "D92532A0","Code": "0.8::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.2::pickup_fails(T).\n\n0.5::drop_slippery_key(T); 0.5::holds_slippery_key(T).\n0.1::fumbles_key(T); 0.9::retains_key(T).\n\n0.8::stays_slippery(T); 0.2::stops_being_slippery(T).\n0.4::initially_slippery(key); 0.6::initially_unslippery(key)."}
