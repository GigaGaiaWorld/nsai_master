  "HASH": "D92532A0",
  "ErrorSummary": "The probabilities for key pickup and retention are suboptimal, leading to failure in carrying the key. Specifically, the probabilities for `pickup_succeeds(T)`, `drop_slippery_key(T)`, and `fumbles_key(T)` are either too low or too high, increasing the likelihood of failure.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Adjust the probabilities as follows: 1. Increase `pickup_succeeds(T)` to 0.9. 2. Decrease `drop_slippery_key(T)` to 0.3. 3. Decrease `fumbles_key(T)` to 0.05. 4. Adjust `stays_slippery(T)` to 0.7 and `initially_slippery(key)` to 0.3 to reduce the chance of the key being slippery.",
