  "ErrorSummary": "1. Inconsistent key retention with significant probability of key remaining at original location. 2. Probability mismatch in carrying success rate. 3. Redundant rules in key location predicates.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Refine drops/2 predicate to cover all drop scenarios and adjust probabilities. 2. Review and adjust probabilities for pickup_succeeds/1 and related actions. 3. Simplify at/3 rules for key location to avoid ambiguity. Add debugging queries for tracing key state.",
