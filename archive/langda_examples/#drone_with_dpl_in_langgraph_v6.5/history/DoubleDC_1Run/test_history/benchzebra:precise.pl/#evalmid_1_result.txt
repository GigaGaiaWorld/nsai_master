<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code for the Zebra puzzle is well-structured and adheres to the logical constraints of the problem. The test result indicates that the code successfully solves the puzzle, producing the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes. The output matches the expected solution, confirming that the logic and predicates are correctly implemented. The code meets all the specified requirements and constraints.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code or the test results. The solution correctly satisfies all the given constraints:
1. The owner of the red house is English.
2. The Spanish person owns a dog.
3. The green house owner drinks coffee.
4. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
5. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
6. The snail owner smokes Winstons.
7. The yellow house owner smokes Kools.
8. The middle house drinks milk.
9. The first house owner is Norwegian.
10. The Chesterfields smoker lives next to the fox owner.
11. The Kools smoker lives next to the horse owner.
12. The orange juice drinker smokes Lucky Strikes.
13. The Japanese person smokes Parliaments.
14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
15. Someone owns a zebra.
16. Someone drinks water.

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Clarity**: While the code is functional, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each predicate (e.g., `right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) for better readability and maintainability.
2. **Testing**: Expand the test cases to include edge cases or variations of the puzzle to ensure robustness.
3. **Documentation**: Document the solution approach and constraints in a README or inline comments to aid future users or collaborators.
4. **Performance**: If the puzzle is scaled to more houses or constraints, consider optimizing the predicates for performance, though this is not currently an issue.
