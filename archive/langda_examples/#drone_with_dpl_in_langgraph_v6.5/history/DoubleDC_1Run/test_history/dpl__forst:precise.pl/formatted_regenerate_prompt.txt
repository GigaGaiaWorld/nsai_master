<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Resultï¼š
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],[1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],[3, 1, 2, 4]) = 1.0000
</Result>
<Analysis>
<Overall_Analysis>
The provided code implements stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) in ProbLog, and the test results indicate that all operations are functioning as expected. The code adheres to the requirements for each operation, and the test cases confirm the correctness of the implementation. The results show a probability of 1.0000 for all operations, indicating deterministic behavior, which is appropriate for stack operations in this context.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code or test results. All operations perform as intended, and the test cases cover the expected behavior for each stack operation. The root cause analysis does not reveal any logical, structural, or semantic issues.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Completeness**: The `stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)` predicate is incomplete. It should be implemented to sort the stack elements. Consider using a sorting algorithm compatible with ProbLog's constraints (e.g., a simple bubble sort or insertion sort for small stacks).

2. **Edge Cases**: Add test cases for edge scenarios, such as:
   - Empty stack operations (e.g., `pop` on an empty stack).
   - Single-element stack operations (e.g., `swap` or `rot` on a stack with fewer than required elements).

3. **Documentation**: Document the assumptions and limitations of the stack operations (e.g., behavior for invalid inputs like insufficient elements for `swap` or `rot`).

4. **Performance**: If the stack operations are part of a larger probabilistic program, ensure that the stack size does not negatively impact performance. Consider optimizations if needed.

5. **Testing**: Expand the test suite to include probabilistic scenarios if the stack operations are used in a probabilistic context (e.g., testing with uncertain inputs).

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
