{"HASH": "6931D64E","ErrorSummary": "The 'sort3' predicate uses unsupported if-then-else constructs in ProbLog and lacks handling for stacks with fewer than 3 elements","SuggestedFix": "Replace if-then-else with ProbLog-compatible constructs and add handling for edge cases (stacks with <3 elements). Example fix:\nsort3(A, B, C, [X, Y, Z]) :-\n    min_list([A, B, C], X),\n    max_list([A, B, C], Z),\n    (X =:= A, Z =:= B, Y = C\n    ; X =:= A, Z =:= C, Y = B\n    ; X =:= B, Z =:= A, Y = C\n    ; X =:= B, Z =:= C, Y = A\n    ; X =:= C, Z =:= A, Y = B\n    ; X =:= C, Z =:= B, Y = A\n    ).\nAlso add a check in the 'sort' operation to handle stacks with fewer than 3 elements.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
