<Overall_Analysis>
The provided code implements a stack with various operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`). The test results show that all operations except `sort` work correctly. The `sort` operation is partially implemented but contains logical issues and uses unsupported ProbLog constructs (if-then-else). The overall code quality is good for the supported operations, but the `sort` operation needs revision to comply with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Test Failure**: The `sort` operation is not tested in the provided results, but the implementation is incomplete and problematic.
   - **Root Cause**: The `sort3` predicate uses unsupported if-then-else constructs (`->`) in ProbLog. Additionally, the `get_top_n` predicate is not fully integrated into the `sort` operation logic.
   - **Logical Issue**: The `sort3` predicate does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than 3 elements, which could lead to runtime errors.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace if-then-else with ProbLog-compatible constructs**:
   - Use `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)` instead of `->` for conditional logic.
   - Example:
     ```prolog
     sort3(A, B, C, [X, Y, Z]) :-
         min_list([A, B, C], X),
         max_list([A, B, C], Z),
         (   X =:= A, Z =:= B, Y = C
         ;   X =:= A, Z =:= C, Y = B
         ;   X =:= B, Z =:= A, Y = C
         ;   X =:= B, Z =:= C, Y = A
         ;   X =:= C, Z =:= A, Y = B
         ;   X =:= C, Z =:= B, Y = A
         ).
     ```

2. **Handle edge cases**:
   - Ensure the `sort` operation works for stacks with fewer than 3 elements. For example, if the stack has 2 elements, sort them directly.

3. **Test the `sort` operation**:
   - Add test cases for `sort` to verify its correctness, including edge cases (e.g., empty stack, stack with 1 or 2 elements).

4. **Integrate `get_top_n` properly**:
   - Ensure the `get_top_n` predicate is correctly used to extract the top 3 elements before sorting and appending them back to the stack.

5. **Document the limitations**:
   - Clearly document that the `sort` operation is designed for stacks with at least 3 elements, or extend it to handle smaller stacks gracefully.
