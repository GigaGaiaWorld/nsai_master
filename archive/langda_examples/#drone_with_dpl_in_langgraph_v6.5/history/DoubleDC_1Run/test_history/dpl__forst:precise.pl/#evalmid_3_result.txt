<Overall_Analysis>
The provided code implements stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) in ProbLog, and the test results indicate that all operations are functioning as expected. The code adheres to the requirements, and the test cases confirm the correctness of each operation. The results show a probability of 1.0000 for all operations, indicating deterministic behavior, which is appropriate for stack operations.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code or test results. All stack operations perform as intended:
- `push(X)` correctly adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `pop` removes the top element.
- `dup` duplicates the top element.
- `swap` swaps the top two elements.
- `over` copies the second element to the top.
- `rot` rotates the top three elements.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Clarity**: The `stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)` predicate is incomplete. If sorting functionality is required, it should be implemented or removed to avoid confusion.
2. **Documentation**: Add comments to explain the purpose of each predicate for better maintainability.
3. **Edge Cases**: Consider adding test cases for edge scenarios, such as an empty stack or operations on a stack with insufficient elements (e.g., `swap` on a stack with only one element).
4. **Error Handling**: While the current implementation works for valid inputs, adding checks for invalid operations (e.g., `pop` on an empty stack) could improve robustness.
5. **Probabilistic Extensions**: If probabilistic behavior is desired (e.g., uncertain stack operations), explore ProbLog's probabilistic features to extend the code.
