<Overall_Analysis>
The provided code implements stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) in ProbLog, and the test results indicate that all operations are functioning as expected. The code adheres to the requirements for each operation, and the test cases confirm the correctness of the implementation. The results show a probability of 1.0000 for all operations, indicating deterministic behavior, which is appropriate for stack operations in this context.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code or test results. All operations perform as intended, and the test cases cover the expected behavior for each stack operation. The root cause analysis does not reveal any logical, structural, or semantic issues.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Completeness**: The `stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)` predicate is incomplete. It should be implemented to sort the stack elements. Consider using a sorting algorithm compatible with ProbLog's constraints (e.g., a simple bubble sort or insertion sort for small stacks).

2. **Edge Cases**: Add test cases for edge scenarios, such as:
   - Empty stack operations (e.g., `pop` on an empty stack).
   - Single-element stack operations (e.g., `swap` or `rot` on a stack with fewer than required elements).

3. **Documentation**: Document the assumptions and limitations of the stack operations (e.g., behavior for invalid inputs like insufficient elements for `swap` or `rot`).

4. **Performance**: If the stack operations are part of a larger probabilistic program, ensure that the stack size does not negatively impact performance. Consider optimizations if needed.

5. **Testing**: Expand the test suite to include probabilistic scenarios if the stack operations are used in a probabilistic context (e.g., testing with uncertain inputs).
