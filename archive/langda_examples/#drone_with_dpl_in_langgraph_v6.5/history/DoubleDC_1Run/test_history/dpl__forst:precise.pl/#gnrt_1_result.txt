Here's the extracted and formatted code block corresponding to the <langda> block in the <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "E659D458", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])."}
```

Note: The <langda> block in the original code only contained a description of the push operation (which was already implemented in both the original and generated code), so there was no new code to extract beyond what was already present. The hash and requirements were provided for the push operation, which is correctly shown in the output above.
