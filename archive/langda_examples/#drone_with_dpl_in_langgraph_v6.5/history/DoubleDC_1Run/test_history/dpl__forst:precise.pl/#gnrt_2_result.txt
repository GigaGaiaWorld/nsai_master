Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code is for the stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]) operation, which is already complete in both origin_code and generated_code. Therefore, there's no new code generated for this block - it remains the same as in the original.

Here's the formatted output:

```problog
{"HASH": "E659D458", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])."}
```
