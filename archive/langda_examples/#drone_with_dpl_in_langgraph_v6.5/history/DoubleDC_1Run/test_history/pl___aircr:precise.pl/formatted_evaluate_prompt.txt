<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, such as actuator selection and wind effects. The test results indicate that the system successfully calculates the probability of reaching the goal position (`goal_reached`) and the probability of overrun exceptions (`overrun_exception`) over five time steps. The probabilities for `goal_reached` decrease over time, while `overrun_exception` probabilities peak around time steps 3 and 4. The code adheres to ProbLog syntax and control constructs, and the results align with the probabilistic nature of the model.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **No Syntax Errors**: The code follows ProbLog syntax rules, including negation-as-failure (`\+`), arithmetic evaluation (`is`), and probabilistic annotations (`::`).
2. **Logical Consistency**: The logic for calculating the flap position (`attempted_flap_position`) and checking for overruns (`overrun_exception`) is sound.
3. **Test Results**: The test results show no unexpected failures, but the decreasing probability of `goal_reached` suggests the system may not always reach the goal efficiently. The presence of `overrun_exception` indicates edge cases where the flap position exceeds legal bounds.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Optimize Goal Achievement**: To increase the probability of reaching the goal, consider adjusting the actuator strengths or wind effect probabilities. For example, increasing the strength of actuator `a` or reducing the variance in wind effects could improve performance.
2. **Handle Overruns**: Introduce safeguards to prevent overruns, such as clamping the flap position within legal bounds (`0` to `10`) after calculating `Pos` in `attempted_flap_position`.
3. **Debugging**: If the probabilities seem counterintuitive, add debug queries to inspect intermediate values (e.g., `AE`, `WE`, and `Pos`) to ensure calculations align with expectations.
4. **Documentation**: Clarify the purpose of `at(5)` and its relationship to the query predicates to avoid confusion.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
