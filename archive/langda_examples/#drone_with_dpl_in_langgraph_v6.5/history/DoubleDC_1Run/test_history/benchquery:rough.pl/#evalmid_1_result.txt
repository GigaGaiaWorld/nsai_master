<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code defines a predicate `query_pop/1` to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% of each other). The code correctly implements the logic for calculating population density and comparing pairs of countries. The test results show successful matches, indicating that the code meets the specified requirements. The density calculation and comparison logic are sound, and the results align with the expected behavior.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code or the test results. The code successfully:
1. Calculates population density for each country using the `density/2` predicate.
2. Compares pairs of countries to ensure their densities are within 5% of each other.
3. Avoids duplicate pairs by enforcing `Country1 @< Country2`.
4. Returns valid results as demonstrated in the test output.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Clarity**: Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each predicate and the logic behind the density comparison. For example:
   ```prolog
   % Calculate population density for a country
   density(Country, Density) :-
       pop(Country, Pop),
       area(Country, Area),
       Density is Pop / Area.

   % Find pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within 5%)
   query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
       density(Country1, Density1),
       density(Country2, Density2),
       Country1 @< Country2, % Ensure unique pairs
       abs(Density1 - Density2) =< 0.05 * max(Density1, Density2). % Check density difference
   ```

2. **Testing**: Expand the test cases to include edge cases, such as:
   - Countries with very high or very low densities.
   - Pairs where the density difference is exactly 5%.

3. **Performance**: If the database grows significantly, consider optimizing the comparison logic to avoid redundant calculations (e.g., precomputing densities).

4. **Documentation**: Document the units used for population (`100000's`) and area (`1000's of square miles`) to avoid confusion.

The code is functionally correct and meets the requirements, so no structural or logical changes are necessary.
