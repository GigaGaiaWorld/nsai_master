<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The code defines the behavior of the flap position based on actuator strength, wind effects, and legal positions. The test results show probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` over five time steps. The probabilities for `goal_reached` decrease over time, while `overrun_exception` probabilities are low but non-zero after the first step. The overall structure of the code aligns with the requirements, but there are minor issues to address.

### Error Summary
1. **Inconsistent Goal Achievement Probabilities**:
   - The probabilities for `goal_reached` decrease over time (e.g., from 0.2625 at T=1 to 0.0570 at T=5). This suggests the model may not efficiently guide the flap toward the goal position (4) over time.
   - Root Cause: The actuator strength and wind effects may not be optimally balanced, leading to suboptimal movement toward the goal.

2. **Non-Zero Overrun Exceptions**:
   - `overrun_exception` probabilities are non-zero after T=1 (e.g., 0.0030 at T=2, 0.0110 at T=3). This indicates the flap occasionally moves outside the legal range (0-10).
   - Root Cause: The wind effects and actuator strength combinations sometimes push the flap beyond legal bounds, especially under strong wind conditions.

3. **Missing Wind Effect Handling**:
   - The wind effects (`wind_effect`) are modeled but may not be sufficiently constrained to prevent overruns.
   - Root Cause: The wind effect ranges (-3 to 3 for strong wind) are large relative to the actuator strengths (1 or 2), increasing the risk of overruns.

### Recommendations
1. **Adjust Actuator Strengths**:
   - Increase the actuator strengths (e.g., `actuator_strength(a,3)` and `actuator_strength(b,2)`) to better counteract wind effects and improve goal achievement.

2. **Constrain Wind Effects**:
   - Reduce the range of wind effects for strong wind (e.g., `-2, -1, 1, 2` instead of `-3, -2, 2, 3`) to minimize overruns.

3. **Optimize Goal Movement**:
   - Modify the `attempted_flap_position` rule to prioritize movement toward the goal. For example, ensure the actuator's effect (`AE`) is always sufficient to counteract the wind effect (`WE`).

4. **Add Debugging Queries**:
   - Include queries to track intermediate positions (e.g., `query(flap_position(T, Pos))`) to better understand the flap's movement and identify problematic steps.

5. **Validate Legal Positions**:
   - Add a check in `attempted_flap_position` to ensure the calculated `Pos` is within legal bounds before proceeding, reducing the likelihood of overruns.

By implementing these changes, the model should achieve higher `goal_reached` probabilities and lower `overrun_exception` rates, aligning more closely with the intended behavior.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
