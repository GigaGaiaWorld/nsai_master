<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors and implements a game logic to determine the winner of a sequence of moves. The code is logically structured and adheres to the requirements of defining the game rules. However, the test results reveal inconsistencies in the output, where multiple outcomes (player1, player2, and draw) are assigned a probability of 1.0000 for the same input, which is incorrect. This suggests a logical flaw in the scoring or result determination process.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Test Failures**: The test results show that the query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` incorrectly returns all three possible outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, and `draw`) with a probability of 1.0000. This is impossible, as the game should have a single deterministic outcome for a given sequence of moves.

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which uses the `play/3` predicate to generate results and then computes a score. The problem arises because the `play/3` predicate does not enforce deterministic outcomes for each round. Instead, it allows all possible outcomes (`win`, `lose`, `draw`) to coexist, leading to ambiguous results.
   - The `compute_score/2` predicate does not account for the ambiguity in the results, leading to incorrect scoring and winner determination.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix the `play_round/3` Predicate**:
   - Ensure that the `play_round/3` predicate enforces a single deterministic outcome for each round. Modify it to explicitly check the `beats/2` relationship and assign the correct result without ambiguity.
   - Example fix:
     ```prolog
     play_round(Move1, Move2, Result) :-
         beats(Move1, Move2) -> Result = win ;
         beats(Move2, Move1) -> Result = lose ;
         Result = draw.
     ```

2. **Clarify the `play/3` Predicate**:
   - Ensure that the `play/3` predicate propagates deterministic results for each round. The current implementation allows for backtracking over ambiguous outcomes, which is unnecessary for this use case.

3. **Review the `compute_score/2` Predicate**:
   - Verify that the scoring logic correctly aggregates the results. The current implementation is correct, but it relies on the `play/3` predicate providing unambiguous results.

4. **Test with Additional Cases**:
   - After fixing the code, test it with additional sequences of moves to ensure that the results are deterministic and correct. For example:
     ```prolog
     query(determine_winner([rock,paper,scissor],[scissor,rock,paper],W)).
     ```

5. **Document the Fixes**:
   - Add comments to the code to explain the changes and ensure that future modifications do not reintroduce the ambiguity.
