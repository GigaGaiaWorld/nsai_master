<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors and implements a game logic to determine the winner of a sequence of moves. The code is logically structured and adheres to the requirements of defining the game rules. However, the test results reveal inconsistencies in the output, where multiple outcomes (player1, player2, and draw) are assigned a probability of 1.0000 for the same input, which is incorrect. This suggests a logical flaw in the scoring or result determination process.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Test Failures**: The test results show that the query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` incorrectly returns all three possible outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, and `draw`) with a probability of 1.0000. This is impossible, as the game should have a single deterministic outcome for a given sequence of moves.

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which uses the `play/3` predicate to generate results and then computes a score. The problem arises because the `play/3` predicate does not enforce deterministic outcomes for each round. Instead, it allows all possible outcomes (`win`, `lose`, `draw`) to coexist, leading to ambiguous results.
   - The `compute_score/2` predicate does not account for the ambiguity in the results, leading to incorrect scoring and winner determination.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix the `play_round/3` Predicate**:
   - Ensure that the `play_round/3` predicate enforces a single deterministic outcome for each round. Modify it to explicitly check the `beats/2` relationship and assign the correct result without ambiguity.
   - Example fix:
     ```prolog
     play_round(Move1, Move2, Result) :-
         beats(Move1, Move2) -> Result = win ;
         beats(Move2, Move1) -> Result = lose ;
         Result = draw.
     ```

2. **Clarify the `play/3` Predicate**:
   - Ensure that the `play/3` predicate propagates deterministic results for each round. The current implementation allows for backtracking over ambiguous outcomes, which is unnecessary for this use case.

3. **Review the `compute_score/2` Predicate**:
   - Verify that the scoring logic correctly aggregates the results. The current implementation is correct, but it relies on the `play/3` predicate providing unambiguous results.

4. **Test with Additional Cases**:
   - After fixing the code, test it with additional sequences of moves to ensure that the results are deterministic and correct. For example:
     ```prolog
     query(determine_winner([rock,paper,scissor],[scissor,rock,paper],W)).
     ```

5. **Document the Fixes**:
   - Add comments to the code to explain the changes and ensure that future modifications do not reintroduce the ambiguity.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
