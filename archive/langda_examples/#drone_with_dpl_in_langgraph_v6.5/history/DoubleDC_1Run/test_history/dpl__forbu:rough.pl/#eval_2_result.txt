{"HASH": "47D659C8", "ErrorSummary": "The bubblesort implementation is incorrect as it doesn't properly sort the list (result shows [1, 12, 7, 5, 2, 3] instead of [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12])", "SuggestedFix": "Rewrite the bubblesort/3 predicate to properly implement bubble sort algorithm by: 1) Adding a pass counter, 2) Implementing proper swapping and termination when no swaps occur in a pass", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
