<Overall_Analysis>
The provided Prolog code implements a bubblesort algorithm, but it fails when executed in ProbLog due to the use of an unsupported control construct (the if-then operator `->`). ProbLog does not support imperative control constructs like `->` and requires a declarative alternative. The overall structure of the code is correct for a bubblesort, but the implementation needs to be adjusted to comply with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Test Failure**: The error message indicates that the `->` operator is not supported in ProbLog. This occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate where the comparison and branching logic is implemented using `->`.
2. **Root Cause**: The root cause is the use of the unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog. ProbLog restricts control constructs to maintain logical semantics and does not allow imperative branching.
3. **Additional Issue**: The code does not explicitly handle cases where the input list is already sorted, which could lead to inefficiency or redundant steps.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace `->` with a Declarative Alternative**: 
   - Use the supported disjunction (`;`) and conjunction (`,`) operators to implement the branching logic. For example:
     ```prolog
     bubblesort([H1, H2|T], Acc, Sorted) :-
         (H1 =< H2,
          bubblesort([H1|T], [H2|Acc], Sorted))
         ;
         (H1 > H2,
          bubblesort([H2|T], [H1|Acc], Sorted)).
     ```

2. **Optimize for Already Sorted Lists**:
   - Add a check to terminate early if the list is already sorted. This can be done by comparing adjacent elements and proceeding only if a swap is needed.

3. **Testing**:
   - After modifying the code, test it with various inputs (e.g., already sorted, reverse sorted, and random lists) to ensure correctness and efficiency.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Document the changes to clarify why the declarative approach is used and how it aligns with ProbLog's requirements.
