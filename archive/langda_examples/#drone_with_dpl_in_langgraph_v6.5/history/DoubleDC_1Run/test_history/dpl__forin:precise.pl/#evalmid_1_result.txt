<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code for the `insertion_sort` predicate appears to be logically correct and meets the specified requirements. The test result confirms that the code successfully sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating no errors in the given test case. The code adheres to the supported ProbLog syntax and control constructs, and it correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm recursively.

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the provided code or test results. The code functions as intended, and the test case passes successfully. The root cause analysis does not reveal any logical, structural, or semantic issues.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Additional Test Cases**: While the current test case passes, it is recommended to test the code with additional edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements, to ensure robustness.
   - Example: `query(insertion_sort([], X)).` and `query(insertion_sort([5, 5, 3, 2], X)).`

2. **Documentation**: Add comments to the code to explain the logic of the `insert_element` predicate and the recursive nature of the `insertion_sort` predicate for better maintainability.

3. **Performance Considerations**: If the code is intended for larger lists, consider optimizing the `insert_element` predicate to minimize redundant comparisons, though this is not strictly necessary for small lists.

4. **ProbLog-Specific Features**: If the code is part of a larger probabilistic program, ensure that any probabilistic predicates or annotations are correctly integrated without violating ProbLog's constraints.
