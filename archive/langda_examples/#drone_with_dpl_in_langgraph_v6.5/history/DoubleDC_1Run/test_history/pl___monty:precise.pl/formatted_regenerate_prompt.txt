prize(1) = 0.3333

win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
</Result>
<Analysis>
<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code implements the Monty Hall problem, and the test results align with the expected probabilities for the problem: `win_keep` has a probability of 0.3333 (1/3), and `win_switch` has a probability of 0.6667 (2/3). This suggests that the code correctly models the problem's requirements. However, there are minor syntactic and structural issues in the code that could be improved for clarity and correctness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Error in `open_door` Rule**:
   - The rule `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)` is incomplete and lacks proper termination (a period is missing at the end of the line). This could lead to parsing errors.
   - The rule `open_door(A)` is also incomplete and lacks a terminating period.

2. **Logical Redundancy**:
   - The `member/2` predicate is defined twice, which is unnecessary since it is a standard Prolog predicate. Redefining it could lead to confusion or unintended behavior.

3. **Unused Variable**:
   - In the rule `open_door(A) :- select_door(Selected), ...`, the variable `Selected` is bound but never used in the body of the rule. This could indicate a logical oversight or incomplete implementation.

4. **Code Structure**:
   - The code lacks comments or documentation explaining the logic, which could make it harder to maintain or debug.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax Errors**:
   - Add terminating periods to the incomplete rules (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)` and `open_door(A)`).
   - Ensure all clauses are properly terminated and syntactically correct.

2. **Remove Redundant Definitions**:
   - Remove the redundant definition of `member/2` since it is a standard Prolog predicate and not needed in ProbLog.

3. **Clarify Logic**:
   - Use the variable `Selected` in the `open_door` rule to ensure the logic is clear and complete. For example, explicitly state that the host opens a door not selected by the contestant and not containing the prize.

4. **Add Comments**:
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of each rule and the overall logic of the Monty Hall problem implementation. This will improve readability and maintainability.

5. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Test the code with edge cases, such as when the contestant selects the door with the prize initially, to ensure the rules behave as expected.

6. **Verify Host Behavior**:
   - Ensure the host's behavior (opening a door) is explicitly modeled according to the problem's requirements (randomly choosing between two empty doors or opening the only empty door with certainty).

By addressing these issues, the code will be more robust, readable, and aligned with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
