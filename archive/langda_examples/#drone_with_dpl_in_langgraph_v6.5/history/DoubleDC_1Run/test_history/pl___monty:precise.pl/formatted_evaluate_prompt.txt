<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code for the Monty Hall problem is mostly correct and aligns with the expected behavior of the problem. The test results show that the probabilities for `win_keep` (0.3333) and `win_switch` (0.6667) are consistent with the theoretical probabilities of the Monty Hall problem. This indicates that the logic for selecting doors, opening doors, and determining wins is implemented correctly. However, there are minor syntactic and structural issues in the code that could be improved for clarity and correctness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Error in `open_door` Rules**:
   - The first `open_door` rule is incomplete and lacks a proper body. The line `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-` is not properly terminated or implemented.
   - The second `open_door` rule is correctly implemented but could be more clearly documented.

2. **Redundant `member` Predicate**:
   - The `member` predicate is defined twice in the code, which is redundant. One definition would suffice.

3. **Missing Documentation**:
   - The code lacks comments or documentation explaining the logic, especially for the `open_door` rules, which are critical to the problem.

4. **Unused Variable in `select_door`**:
   - The variable `Selected` in the `open_door` rules is not used in the body of the rules, which could lead to confusion.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax Errors**:
   - Complete the first `open_door` rule with the correct body or remove it if it is redundant.
   - Ensure all rules are properly terminated with a period.

2. **Remove Redundancy**:
   - Keep only one definition of the `member` predicate to avoid redundancy.

3. **Add Documentation**:
   - Add comments to explain the logic of the `open_door` rules and the overall flow of the program.

4. **Clarify Variable Usage**:
   - Either use the `Selected` variable in the `open_door` rules or remove it to avoid confusion.

5. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Test the code with edge cases, such as when the prize is behind the initially selected door, to ensure robustness.

6. **Improve Readability**:
   - Format the code consistently (e.g., indentation, spacing) to improve readability.

Example Fix for the `open_door` Rule:
```prolog
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    A < B,
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ select_door(B),
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ prize(B).
```

By addressing these issues, the code will be more robust, readable, and maintainable.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
