<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, which is a classic divide-and-conquer sorting method. The test result shows that the code successfully sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating correctness for this input. The code adheres to ProbLog's supported syntax and control constructs, avoiding unsupported features like cuts or imperative control. Overall, the implementation is logically sound and meets the requirements for an interpretable merge sort in ProbLog.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the provided code or test results. The implementation correctly handles the base cases (empty list and single-element list) and recursively splits, sorts, and merges the list halves. The test case confirms the algorithm's correctness for a typical input.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Additional Test Cases**: While the current test case is valid, consider testing edge cases such as:
   - An already sorted list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
   - A list with duplicate elements (e.g., `[3, 1, 2, 1]`).
   - A large list to ensure scalability (though ProbLog is not optimized for performance-heavy tasks).

2. **Documentation**: Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate (`merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, `merge/3`) for better maintainability.

3. **ProbLog-Specific Features**: If the goal is to integrate probabilistic reasoning, consider extending the algorithm to handle probabilistic lists or uncertain comparisons (though this would require additional ProbLog-specific constructs).

4. **Avoid Redundant Code**: The `append/3` predicate at the end of the code snippet is unused and can be removed to avoid confusion.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
