<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code for `merge_sort` appears to be logically correct and successfully passes the given test case, producing the expected sorted output `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` for the input `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`. The implementation adheres to the requirements, including recursive boundary checks, splitting the list, and merging the sorted sublists. The code is also compatible with ProbLog's supported syntax and control constructs.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the provided code or test results. The implementation meets the specified requirements:
1. Correctly calculates the length of the list to determine splitting.
2. Handles recursive boundary conditions (lists of length 0 or 1).
3. Splits the list into two parts (`Left` and `Right`) for recursive processing.
4. Recursively sorts and merges the sublists.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Edge Case Testing**: While the current test case is successful, consider testing additional edge cases, such as:
   - An empty list: `merge_sort([], X)`.
   - A list with duplicate elements: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 1, 5], X)`.
   - A list already sorted in reverse order: `merge_sort([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], X)`.

2. **Performance Optimization**: The current implementation uses `append/3` for splitting the list, which may not be the most efficient method for large lists. Consider using a more efficient splitting strategy, such as traversing the list once to split it.

3. **Documentation**: Add comments to the code to clarify the purpose of each predicate and the overall logic, especially for users unfamiliar with merge sort in ProbLog.

4. **ProbLog-Specific Features**: If the code is intended for probabilistic reasoning, ensure that any probabilistic extensions (e.g., annotated facts or rules) are correctly integrated without violating ProbLog's constraints.
