problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 39:15.
</Result>
<Analysis>
<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, such as actuator selection and wind effects. The code aims to simulate the movement of the flap from an initial position to a goal position while accounting for actuator strength and wind interference. However, the code fails during execution due to an unsupported control construct (if-then-else) in ProbLog. The overall structure of the code is logical and aligns with the requirements, but the use of unsupported syntax prevents it from running successfully.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Error**: The code fails with the error `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 39:15`.
   - **Root Cause**: The error occurs because ProbLog does not support the if-then-else construct (`->`) used in the `attempted_flap_position` rule. The construct is not part of ProbLog's supported control predicates.
   - **Location**: The issue is in the following line of the `attempted_flap_position` rule:
     ```prolog
     (G > PrevPos -> Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect ; Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect).
     ```
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace the if-then-else construct**:
   - ProbLog does not support `->` or `*->` constructs. Instead, use a disjunction (`;`) with explicit conditions:
     ```prolog
     (G > PrevPos, Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect) ; 
     (G =< PrevPos, Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect).
     ```
   - This achieves the same logical effect without relying on unsupported syntax.

2. **Test the modified code**:
   - After replacing the unsupported construct, rerun the code to ensure it executes without errors and meets the requirements.

3. **Verify edge cases**:
   - Ensure the modified rule handles edge cases, such as when `G == PrevPos` or when wind effects cause the flap position to exceed legal bounds.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add comments to clarify the logic of the modified rule for future maintainability.

5. **Alternative Approach**:
   - If the disjunction approach is cumbersome, consider defining auxiliary predicates to encapsulate the logic for calculating the new position based on the direction of movement.

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
