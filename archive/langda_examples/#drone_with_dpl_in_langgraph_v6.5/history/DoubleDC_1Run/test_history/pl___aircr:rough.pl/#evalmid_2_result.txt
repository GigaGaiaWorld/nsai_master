<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, such as actuator selection and wind effects. The code aims to simulate the movement of the flap from an initial position to a goal position while accounting for actuator strength and wind interference. However, the code fails during execution due to an unsupported control construct (if-then-else) in ProbLog. The overall structure of the code is logical and aligns with the requirements, but the use of unsupported syntax prevents it from running successfully.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Error**: The code fails with the error `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 39:15`.
   - **Root Cause**: The error occurs because ProbLog does not support the if-then-else construct (`->`) used in the `attempted_flap_position` rule. The construct is not part of ProbLog's supported control predicates.
   - **Location**: The issue is in the following line of the `attempted_flap_position` rule:
     ```prolog
     (G > PrevPos -> Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect ; Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect).
     ```
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace the if-then-else construct**:
   - ProbLog does not support `->` or `*->` constructs. Instead, use a disjunction (`;`) with explicit conditions:
     ```prolog
     (G > PrevPos, Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect) ; 
     (G =< PrevPos, Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect).
     ```
   - This achieves the same logical effect without relying on unsupported syntax.

2. **Test the modified code**:
   - After replacing the unsupported construct, rerun the code to ensure it executes without errors and meets the requirements.

3. **Verify edge cases**:
   - Ensure the modified rule handles edge cases, such as when `G == PrevPos` or when wind effects cause the flap position to exceed legal bounds.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add comments to clarify the logic of the modified rule for future maintainability.

5. **Alternative Approach**:
   - If the disjunction approach is cumbersome, consider defining auxiliary predicates to encapsulate the logic for calculating the new position based on the direction of movement.
