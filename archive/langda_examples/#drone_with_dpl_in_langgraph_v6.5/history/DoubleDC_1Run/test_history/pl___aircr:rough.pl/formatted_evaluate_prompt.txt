<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>

 Error evaluating Problog model:
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_builtin.py", line 830, in _builtin_le
    check_mode((arg1, arg2), ["gg"], functor="=<", **k)

</Result>

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to model an aircraft flap controller, incorporating probabilistic elements like actuator selection and wind effects. The code is logically structured but fails during execution due to a `CallModeError` related to the comparison operator `=<`. The error indicates that the arguments for the comparison are not ground (i.e., not fully instantiated), which violates ProbLog's requirement for ground arguments in arithmetic comparisons. The overall design aligns with the requirements, but the implementation needs refinement to handle variable instantiation properly.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Test Failure**: The error occurs in the line `(G =< PrevPos, Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect)`. The `CallModeError` indicates that the arguments `G` and `PrevPos` are not ground when the comparison `=<` is evaluated.
   - **Root Cause**: The comparison operator `=<` requires both arguments to be ground (fully instantiated) at the time of evaluation. In this case, `G` or `PrevPos` might not be instantiated due to the dynamic nature of the probabilistic model or the order of evaluation.
   - **Impact**: The error prevents the code from executing further, halting the simulation of the flap controller.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Ensure Ground Arguments for Comparisons**:
   - Modify the code to ensure `G` and `PrevPos` are ground before the comparison. For example, add checks or constraints to ensure these variables are instantiated before the comparison is made.
   - Example fix:
     ```prolog
     attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
       Time > 0,
       Prev is Time-1,
       flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
       \+ goal_reached(Prev),
       use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
       actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
       goal(G),
       wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
       (ground(G), ground(PrevPos)), % Ensure groundness
       (G > PrevPos, Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect) ; 
       (G =< PrevPos, Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect).
     ```

2. **Debugging and Testing**:
   - Add debug prints or use `debugprint/1` to inspect the values of `G` and `PrevPos` before the comparison to verify their instantiation.
   - Test the modified code with smaller inputs to isolate and confirm the fix.

3. **Documentation Review**:
   - Refer to the ProbLog documentation on arithmetic operators and grounding requirements to ensure compliance with the language's constraints. The documentation confirms that comparison operators like `=<` require ground arguments.

4. **Alternative Approach**:
   - If grounding cannot be guaranteed dynamically, consider restructuring the logic to avoid comparisons with non-ground variables. For example, precompute or constrain the possible values of `G` and `PrevPos` earlier in the program.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
