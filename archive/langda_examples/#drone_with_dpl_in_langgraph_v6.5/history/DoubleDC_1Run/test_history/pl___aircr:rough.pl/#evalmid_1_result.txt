### Evaluation Report

#### **Overall_Analysis**
The provided ProbLog code aims to model an aircraft flap controller, incorporating probabilistic elements like actuator selection and wind effects. The code is logically structured but fails during execution due to unsupported control constructs in ProbLog. The primary issue lies in the use of the `if-then-else` construct (`->`), which is not supported in ProbLog. The test results confirm this, as the error message explicitly points to the unsupported `;` operator in the arithmetic expression.

#### **Error_Summary**
1. **Test Failure**: The test fails with an `ArithmeticError` due to the unsupported `if-then-else` construct (`->`) in the line:
   ```prolog
   Pos is PrevPos + (G > PrevPos -> Strength ; -Strength) + WindEffect.
   ```
   - **Root Cause**: ProbLog does not support the `if-then-else` (`->`) construct. Instead, it requires an alternative approach using disjunction (`;`) and negation (`\+`).

2. **Logical Issue**: The code attempts to conditionally adjust the flap position based on whether the goal position is greater than the current position. This logic is sound but cannot be implemented using `if-then-else` in ProbLog.

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Replace `if-then-else` with Disjunction and Negation**:
   Modify the problematic line to use ProbLog-supported constructs:
   ```prolog
   Pos is PrevPos + ( (G > PrevPos, Strength) ; (\+ (G > PrevPos), -Strength) ) + WindEffect.
   ```
   This achieves the same conditional logic without using `->`.

2. **Validate Arithmetic Expressions**:
   Ensure all arithmetic expressions are evaluated correctly by ProbLog. For example, verify that `WindEffect` is properly instantiated before arithmetic operations.

3. **Test Incrementally**:
   After fixing the syntax, test the code incrementally to ensure the flap position updates correctly under all conditions (e.g., weak/strong wind, actuator selection).

4. **Documentation Review**:
   Refer to the ProbLog documentation for supported control constructs and arithmetic operations to avoid similar issues in the future.

5. **Alternative Approach**:
   If the disjunction-based solution is unclear, consider defining separate predicates for the two cases (e.g., `adjust_up/4` and `adjust_down/4`) and calling them conditionally.

By addressing these issues, the code should execute successfully and meet the requirements for calculating the flap position based on the given conditions.
