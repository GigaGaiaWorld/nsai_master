Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code has:
- Hash: 8DB938FD
- Requirements: detect number from image 5 as 5

The corresponding completed code in generated_code is the detect_number predicate for image_5:

```problog
{"HASH": "8DB938FD", "Code": "detect_number(image_5, 5)."}
```
