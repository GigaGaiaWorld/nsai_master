<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

### Evaluation Report

#### **Overall_Analysis**
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle `AB + BCD = CDE` by ensuring all digits are unique and adhering to the constraints of multi-digit numbers (e.g., no leading zeros). The code is logically structured but fails due to a syntax error (`ParseError: Empty statement found`). This error suggests an issue with the code's formatting or structure, likely an unintended line break or missing content.

#### **Error_Summary**
1. **Error Type**: `ParseError: Empty statement found`
   - **Location**: Line 38:1 (as indicated in the error message).
   - **Root Cause**: The error occurs when the ProbLog parser encounters an empty or malformed statement. This could be due to:
     - A missing or misplaced predicate or rule.
     - An unintended line break or whitespace in the code.
     - A syntax violation (e.g., incomplete rule or misplaced operator).

2. **Code Inspection**:
   - The `query_sum` predicate is correctly defined but may be followed by an empty line or malformed content.
   - The `query(query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]))` line appears to be outside the main code block, which might confuse the parser.

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Fix the Syntax Error**:
   - Ensure there are no empty lines or unintended whitespace in the code.
   - Verify that the `query_sum` predicate and its rules are correctly terminated and formatted.

2. **Code Structure**:
   - Place the `query(query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]))` line inside a proper block or ensure it follows the predicate definitions without ambiguity.
   - Example:
     ```prolog
     % Main predicate: AB + BCD = CDE
     query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
         leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C), % First digits cannot be 0
         digit(D), digit(E),
         all_different([A,B,C,D,E]), % All digits must be unique
         % Column-wise addition
         sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Cout1), % Units place
         sumdigit(Cout1, A, C, D, Cout2), % Tens place
         sumdigit(Cout2, 0, B, C, _). % Hundreds place (no carry out needed)

     % Initiate query
     query(query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])).
     ```

3. **Testing**:
   - After fixing the syntax, test the code with the ProbLog interpreter to ensure it runs without errors and produces the correct solution(s) to the puzzle.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and rule, especially for complex logic like `sumdigit`.

By addressing these issues, the code should execute correctly and solve the cryptoaddition puzzle as intended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if itâ€™s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
