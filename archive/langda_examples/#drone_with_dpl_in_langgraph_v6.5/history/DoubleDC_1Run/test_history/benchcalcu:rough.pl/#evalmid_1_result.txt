<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE" by ensuring all digits are unique and the first digits of multi-digit numbers are not zero. The code includes predicates for digit constraints, uniqueness checks, and column-wise addition. However, the test results indicate a parsing error due to an "Empty statement found," which suggests a structural issue in the code.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **ParseError: Empty statement found**:
   - **Location**: The error occurs at line 38:1 in the code.
   - **Root Cause**: The parser encountered an empty or incomplete statement, likely due to a missing or misplaced predicate or terminator (e.g., a missing period or incomplete rule).
   - **Impact**: The code fails to compile, preventing execution of the intended logic.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix the Empty Statement**:
   - Review the code around line 38 to ensure all predicates and rules are properly terminated with a period (`.`).
   - Check for incomplete or misplaced predicates, especially in the `query_sum` rule or its sub-predicates.

2. **Validate Syntax**:
   - Ensure all predicates (e.g., `leftdigit`, `all_different`, `sumdigit`) are correctly defined and called.
   - Verify that arithmetic expressions (e.g., `X is Cin + A + B`) adhere to ProbLog's supported syntax.

3. **Test Incrementally**:
   - Test individual predicates (e.g., `sumdigit`) separately to isolate any logical or syntactic issues.
   - Gradually combine predicates to identify where the error arises.

4. **Refer to ProbLog Documentation**:
   - Use the official ProbLog documentation to confirm supported syntax and control constructs (e.g., avoid unsupported features like cuts or if-then-else).

5. **Debugging Tools**:
   - If available, use ProbLog's debugging tools or logging to trace the execution and identify the exact point of failure.
