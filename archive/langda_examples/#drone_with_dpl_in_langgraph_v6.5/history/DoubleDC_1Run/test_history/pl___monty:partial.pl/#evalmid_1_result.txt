<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code implements the Monty Hall problem, and the test results align with the expected probabilities for the "keep" and "switch" strategies. Specifically:
- The probability of winning by keeping the original choice (`win_keep`) is 0.3333, which matches the theoretical probability of 1/3.
- The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is 0.6667, which matches the theoretical probability of 2/3.

The code correctly models the problem's requirements, including the host's behavior when opening doors and the contestant's strategies. The syntax and logic are consistent with ProbLog's supported constructs.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code or test results. The implementation meets the requirements:
1. When both unselected doors are empty, one is opened randomly (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).
2. When one unselected door has no prize and the other has a prize, the host opens the door without a prize (`open_door(A)`).
3. The winning conditions for "keep" and "switch" strategies are correctly defined.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Clarity**: While the code is correct, consider adding comments to clarify the logic, especially for readers unfamiliar with the Monty Hall problem or ProbLog syntax.
2. **Testing Edge Cases**: Although the current test results are correct, it may be beneficial to test additional scenarios, such as when the contestant selects a different initial door (e.g., `select_door(2)` or `select_door(3)`).
3. **Documentation**: Document the assumptions (e.g., the host always opens a door and never reveals the prize) to ensure the model's behavior is transparent.
4. **Performance**: If the code is part of a larger project, ensure it scales well with additional doors or more complex scenarios.
