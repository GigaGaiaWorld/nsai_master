### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code aims to model a scenario where multiple coins are tossed, and the success count (number of heads) is accumulated. The test results show probabilities for different success counts (`total(S)`), but the results are not entirely consistent with the expected behavior of a fair coin toss (where each coin has a 0.8 probability of landing heads). The probabilities for `total(4)` and `total(3)` are identical, which suggests a logical error in the code.

### Error Summary
1. **Logical Error in `coins_r/3`**:
   - The predicate `coins_r(SC, S, CNT)` incorrectly uses `coin(CNT)` instead of `coin(C)` for checking the coin toss. This means the code is not properly iterating over the coins but instead reusing the counter value as the coin identifier.
   - The requirement specifies that each coin should be independent, but the current implementation does not reflect this.

2. **Inconsistent Probabilities**:
   - The test results show identical probabilities for `total(4)` and `total(3)`, which is impossible for independent coin tosses with a fixed probability (0.8). This confirms the logical flaw in the code.

3. **Missing Probabilistic Facts**:
   - The code does not explicitly define probabilistic facts for each coin (e.g., `0.8::coin(1).`, `0.8::coin(2).`, etc.), which is necessary for the model to work correctly.

### Recommendations
1. **Fix the `coins_r/3` Predicate**:
   - Replace `coin(CNT)` with `coin(C)` and ensure `C` is properly instantiated for each coin toss. For example:
     ```prolog
     coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
         CNT > 0,
         (coin(CNT), NewSC is SC + 1 ; \+ coin(CNT), NewSC = SC),
         NextCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(NewSC, S, NextCNT).
     ```

2. **Define Probabilistic Facts**:
   - Explicitly define probabilistic facts for each coin. For example:
     ```prolog
     0.8::coin(1).
     0.8::coin(2).
     0.8::coin(3).
     0.8::coin(4).
     ```

3. **Generalize the Code**:
   - If the number of coins is dynamic, use a rule to generate probabilistic facts programmatically. For example:
     ```prolog
     coin(C) :- between(1, 4, C), 0.8::coin(C).
     ```

4. **Test the Corrected Code**:
   - After making these changes, rerun the tests to ensure the probabilities align with the expected binomial distribution for 4 coin tosses with a success probability of 0.8.

### Corrected Code Example
```prolog
% Probabilistic facts for each coin
0.8::coin(1).
0.8::coin(2).
0.8::coin(3).
0.8::coin(4).

% Recursive predicate to count successes
coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT), NewSC is SC + 1 ; \+ coin(CNT), NewSC = SC),
    NextCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NewSC, S, NextCNT).

% Query
total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).
```

This corrected code should produce probabilities that reflect the binomial distribution for 4 independent coin tosses with a success probability of 0.8.
