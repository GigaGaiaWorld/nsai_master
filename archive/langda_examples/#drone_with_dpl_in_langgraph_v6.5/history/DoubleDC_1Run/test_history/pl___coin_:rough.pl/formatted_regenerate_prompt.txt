    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
<Analysis>
<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a coin multiple times and counting the number of heads. However, the code fails to execute due to a `NonGroundProbabilisticClause` error, which indicates that the probabilistic clause is not fully grounded (i.e., contains uninstantiated variables). The overall structure of the code aligns with the requirements, but the error prevents it from functioning as intended.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Error**: `NonGroundProbabilisticClause` at line 1:5.
   - **Root Cause**: The probabilistic clause `PH::make_coin(C, PH)` is not grounded because the variable `C` is not instantiated before being used in the probabilistic fact. ProbLog requires all probabilistic facts to be ground (i.e., contain no unbound variables) during evaluation.
   - **Impact**: The error halts the execution of the program, preventing the simulation of coin tosses and the accumulation of results.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix the Probabilistic Clause**:
   - Ensure that the variable `C` in `PH::make_coin(C, PH)` is instantiated before being used in the probabilistic fact. For example, you could define `make_coin/2` with a fixed identifier for the coin:
     ```prolog
     make_coin(coin1, 0.8).
     ```
   - Alternatively, if you need to generate multiple coins dynamically, use a deterministic predicate to instantiate `C` before calling the probabilistic fact.

2. **Revise the `coin/1` Predicate**:
   - The predicate `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).` inherits the grounding issue. Replace it with a grounded version, such as:
     ```prolog
     coin(coin1) :- make_coin(coin1, 0.8).
     ```

3. **Test the Revised Code**:
   - After fixing the grounding issue, test the code with the query `query(total(_)).` to ensure it correctly simulates the coin tosses and accumulates the number of heads.

4. **General Best Practices**:
   - Avoid using uninstantiated variables in probabilistic facts.
   - Use deterministic predicates to generate or instantiate variables before they are used in probabilistic contexts.
   - Refer to the ProbLog documentation for supported control constructs and arithmetic operations to ensure compatibility.

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

% Define a grounded probabilistic fact for the coin
0.8::make_coin(coin1).

% Define the coin predicate with a grounded identifier
coin(coin1) :- make_coin(coin1).

% Base case: when CNT is 0, the accumulated heads SC is the final result S
coins_r(SC, SC, 0).

% Recursive case: sample a coin, check if it's heads (1) or tails (0), and accumulate the count
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(C),
    (C =:= 1, NewSC is SC + 1 ; C =:= 0, NewSC = SC),
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT).

% Query to get the total number of heads after tossing 4 coins
total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
