{"HASH": "55F6DA26", "ErrorSummary": "The current implementation does not fully satisfy the requirements. It handles the case with one available door correctly but doesn't properly implement uniform random selection when there are two available doors. The probability distribution is hardcoded to 0.5 for each door regardless of the actual number of available doors.", "SuggestedFix": "Modify the open_door/1 predicate to: 1) When there are two available doors (OtherDoors has length 2), select one uniformly at random (0.5 probability each). 2) When there's only one available door (OtherDoors has length 1), select it with probability 1. The current implementation mixes these cases incorrectly.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
