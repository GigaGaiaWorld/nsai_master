<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

</Syntax_Notes>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured in <Overall_Analysis>, <Error_Summary> and <Recommendations> blocks as follows:

<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

**split**


In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

 Error evaluating Problog model:

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 13:16.
</Result>

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem, but it fails during execution due to an unsupported control construct (if-then-else). The error indicates that the `->` operator is not supported in ProbLog, which aligns with the syntax notes provided. The code also lacks proper handling of the `open_door/1` predicate as per the requirements. The overall structure of the code is logical, but it does not fully comply with ProbLog's syntax restrictions.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Unsupported Control Construct**: The error message indicates that the `->` operator in the `open_door/1` predicate is not supported in ProbLog. This is confirmed by the syntax notes, which state that if-then-else constructs are not allowed.
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `open_door/1` predicate does not fully implement the requirements. Specifically, it does not handle the case where there is only one door to open (the second requirement).
3. **Missing Clauses**: The error suggests that the system cannot find clauses for a predicate, which may be due to incorrect or incomplete definitions.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace If-Then-Else**: Replace the unsupported `->` operator with a ProbLog-compatible alternative, such as using `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)`.
2. **Implement Both Cases for `open_door/1`**:
   - For the case where there are two doors to choose from, use a uniform probability distribution (e.g., `0.5::open_door(Door1) ; 0.5::open_door(Door2)`).
   - For the case where there is only one door, ensure the predicate always opens that door (e.g., `true::open_door(Door)`).
3. **Verify Predicate Definitions**: Ensure all predicates (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`) are correctly defined and accessible during execution.
4. **Test Incrementally**: After making changes, test the `open_door/1` predicate in isolation to ensure it behaves as expected before integrating it into the full model.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if itâ€™s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
