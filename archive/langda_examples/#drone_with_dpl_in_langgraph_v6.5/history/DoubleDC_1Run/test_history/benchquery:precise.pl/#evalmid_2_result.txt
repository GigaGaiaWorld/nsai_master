### Overall Analysis
The provided ProbLog code aims to query countries with approximately equal population densities by comparing their densities using integer arithmetic to avoid division. The test results show successful matches, indicating that the code generally meets the requirements. However, the density calculation and comparison logic could be reviewed for potential improvements in accuracy and efficiency.

### Error Summary
1. **Density Calculation Precision**:
   - The `density/2` predicate uses floor division (`//`), which may lead to loss of precision. For example, `(P * 100) // A` truncates the result, potentially causing minor discrepancies in density comparisons.
   - **Root Cause**: The use of floor division instead of floating-point division or rounding.

2. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1` approximate `D1/D2 < 1.05`, but this may not always capture the intended "approximately equal" condition due to integer truncation.
   - **Root Cause**: The approximation may not account for edge cases where densities are very close but not within the 5% threshold due to integer arithmetic.

### Recommendations
1. **Improve Density Calculation**:
   - Replace floor division (`//`) with floating-point division (`/`) to retain precision. For example:
     ```prolog
     D is (P * 100) / A.
     ```
   - Alternatively, use rounding to the nearest integer if integer results are preferred:
     ```prolog
     D is round((P * 100) / A).
     ```

2. **Refine Comparison Logic**:
   - Use floating-point arithmetic for the comparison to ensure accuracy:
     ```prolog
     abs(D1 - D2) < 0.05 * max(D1, D2).
     ```
   - If integer arithmetic is required, consider adjusting the inequalities to account for truncation effects, e.g., by widening the bounds slightly.

3. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Add test cases where densities are very close but not exactly equal to verify the robustness of the comparison logic.

4. **Document Assumptions**:
   - Clearly document the approximation method used (e.g., "densities are considered approximately equal if they differ by less than 5%") to ensure clarity for future maintenance.

By implementing these changes, the code will better align with the requirements and provide more accurate results.
