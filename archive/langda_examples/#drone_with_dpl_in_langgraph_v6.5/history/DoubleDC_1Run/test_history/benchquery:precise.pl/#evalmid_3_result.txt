<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population densities. The test results indicate that the code successfully identifies such pairs, as all listed results meet the requirement of approximately equal densities (within a 5% margin). The code adheres to the specified requirements, avoiding division and decimals by using integer arithmetic and inequalities. The logic is sound, and the implementation aligns with ProbLog's supported features.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors or failures were identified in the test results. The code correctly implements the logic for calculating population density and comparing densities using the specified inequalities. All test cases pass, confirming that the code meets the requirements.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Code Clarity**: While the code works correctly, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the inequalities (`20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1`) for better readability.
2. **Edge Cases**: Test edge cases, such as countries with very small or very large population densities, to ensure robustness.
3. **Performance**: If the database grows significantly, optimize the query to avoid redundant calculations (e.g., caching densities).
4. **Documentation**: Document the assumptions (e.g., population and area units) to avoid confusion for future users.
