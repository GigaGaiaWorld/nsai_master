  "ErrorSummary": "Timeout during execution due to inefficient search space and unoptimized `all_different` predicate",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Replace the custom `all_different` implementation with `permutation/2` or use a built-in solver. 2. Add additional heuristics like `A < C, B < C` to reduce the search space. 3. Ensure constraints explicitly forbid negative values.",
