Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code.

The <langda> section in origin_code is incomplete and requires the implementation of the `expression/2` predicate. In the generated_code, this is completed with the following code:

```problog
{"HASH": "8DB938FD", "Code": "expression(Images, Result) :- \n    detect_all(Images, Parsed),\n    parse(Parsed, Result)."}
```
