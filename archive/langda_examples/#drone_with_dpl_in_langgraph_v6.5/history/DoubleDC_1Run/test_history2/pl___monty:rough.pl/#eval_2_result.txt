  "HASH": "55F6DA26",
  "ErrorSummary": "1. Typo in prize/1 and prize/2 (should be prize). 2. open_door/1 does not explicitly handle the case where only one door is available for Monty to open. 3. The findall and length check in open_door/1 is redundant and inefficient.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Correct the typo to 'prize'. 2. Simplify open_door/1 to explicitly handle the two cases: if there are two doors, Monty chooses one uniformly at random; if there is only one door, Monty must open it. Use the following revised predicate:\nopen_door(Door) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(Door, [1,2,3]),\n    \+ prize(Door),\n    \+ (Door = Selected),\n    findall(OtherDoor, (\n        member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]),\n        \+ prize(OtherDoor),\n        \+ (OtherDoor = Selected)\n    ), Doors),\n    (   Doors = [A, B] -> random_member(Door, [A, B])\n    ;   Doors = [A] -> Door = A\n    ).",
