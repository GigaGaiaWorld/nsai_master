### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### 1. **Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### 2. **Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. It defines the valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`), the win-lose relationships (`beats/2`), and a mechanism to play rounds and determine the winner of a sequence of moves. The purpose is to simulate the game and compute the winner based on the results of each round.

#### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
% -------------------------
% Basic rules of rock-paper-scissors
% -------------------------
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).
% -------------------------
% Calculate the result of the game
% -------------------------
valid_move(Move) :- move(Move).

play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :-
    valid_move(P1Move), valid_move(P2Move),
    ( beats(P1Move, P2Move) -> Result = win
    ; beats(P2Move, P1Move) -> Result = lose
    ; Result = draw
    ).

play([], [], []).
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    play_round(P1, P2, Result),
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).

compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.

determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), 
    compute_score(Results,S), 
    ( S > 0, Winner = player1 
    ; S < 0, Winner = player2 
    ; S = 0, Winner = draw 
    ).

query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

---

#### 4. **Overall Analysis**
The code correctly defines the game rules and implements the logic for playing rounds and computing the winner. However, the error in the test results indicates a problem with the `->` operator in the `play_round` predicate, which is not recognized by ProbLog. The rest of the logic is sound, but the syntax needs adjustment to comply with ProbLog's requirements.

#### 5. **Error Summary**

| **Number** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Unknown `->` operator in ProbLog     | Prevents execution of `play_round`  | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if-then-else`). |
| 2          | Typo in `scissor` (spelled as `scissor` and `scissor`) | Inconsistent naming | Correct the spelling to `scissors` for consistency. |

---

#### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**

##### **Fix 1: Replace `->` with ProbLog-Compatible Logic**
The `->` operator is not supported in ProbLog. Replace it with a nested `if-then-else` structure or use separate clauses for each condition.

**Updated `play_round` Predicate:**
```prolog
play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :-
    valid_move(P1Move), valid_move(P2Move),
    ( beats(P1Move, P2Move), Result = win
    ; beats(P2Move, P1Move), Result = lose
    ; Result = draw
    ).
```

##### **Fix 2: Correct Spelling of `scissor`**
Ensure consistency in the spelling of `scissors` throughout the code.

**Updated `beats` Facts:**
```prolog
beats(rock, scissors).
beats(scissors, paper).
beats(paper, rock).
```

##### **Handling Zero or Negative Scores**
The `compute_score` predicate already handles zero or negative scores correctly by decrementing the score for `lose` results and leaving it unchanged for `draw` results. No further changes are needed here.

---

#### **Final Check**
- **Examples of Handling Zero/Negative Values**: The `compute_score` predicate already accounts for these cases.
- **Table Format and Code Blocks**: Verified as correct.

---

#### **Conclusion**
The revised code should resolve the error and function as intended. The fixes address the syntax issues and ensure consistency in the game rules. The logic for determining the winner remains robust and handles all edge cases.
