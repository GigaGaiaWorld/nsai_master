### 1. **Document Title**  
**Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

### 2. **Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a system to determine the winner of a series of moves between two players. The purpose is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation and identify any logical or structural issues in the code.

---

### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**  
```prolog
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).

% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).

valid_move(Move) :- move(Move).

play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :-
    valid_move(P1Move), valid_move(P2Move),
    ( beats(P1Move, P2Move), Result = win
    ; beats(P2Move, P1Move), Result = lose
    ; Result = draw
    ).

play([], [], []).
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    play_round(P1, P2, Result),
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).

compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.

determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), 
    compute_score(Results,S), 
    ( S > 0, Winner = player1 
    ; S < 0, Winner = player2 
    ; S = 0, Winner = draw 
    ).

query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

---

### 4. **Overall Analysis**  
The code correctly defines the rules of rock-paper-scissors and implements a scoring system. However, the test results reveal a logical inconsistency where the query returns multiple conflicting results (`player2`, `draw`, and `player1` with probability 1.0000 each). This indicates a flaw in the `determine_winner` predicate, likely due to incorrect handling of the score computation or result aggregation.

### 5. **Error Summary**  

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Conflicting results for the same query | Incorrect winner determination      | Ensure the `determine_winner` predicate enforces mutual exclusivity of outcomes. |
| 2       | Score computation logic              | Ambiguous scoring for draws         | Clarify the scoring logic to avoid overlapping conditions.                      |

---

### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**  

#### **Issue 1: Conflicting Results**  
The `determine_winner` predicate should enforce mutual exclusivity. Currently, it allows multiple outcomes to be true simultaneously. Modify the predicate to ensure only one outcome is possible.

**Fix:**  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, S), 
    ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1 
    ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2 
    ; Winner = draw 
    ).
```

#### **Issue 2: Score Computation Logic**  
The `compute_score` predicate works correctly, but the issue lies in how the results are aggregated. Ensure the `play` predicate correctly maps moves to results.

**Fix:**  
No changes are needed to `compute_score`, but ensure the `play` predicate is correctly implemented.

---

### **Final Checks**  
- **Handling Zero or Negative Values**: The `compute_score` predicate already handles zero and negative scores correctly.  
- **Table Format and Code Blocks**: Verified for correctness.  

The revised code should now produce unambiguous results for the query.
