### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### 1. **Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### 2. **Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors. It defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`), the winning relationships (`beats`), and a mechanism to determine the winner of a series of moves between two players. The purpose is to simulate the game and compute the final result based on the moves of both players.

---

#### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).

% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(paper, rock).
beats(scissor, paper).

% Calculate the result of the game
result(X, X, draw) :- move(X).
result(X, Y, win) :- beats(X, Y).
result(X, Y, lose) :- beats(Y, X).

% Play the game and compute results
play([], [], []).
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
    result(P1, P2, R),
    play(P1T, P2T, Rs).

% Compute the score
compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S).

% Determine the winner
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), 
    compute_score(Results,S), 
    ( S > 0, Winner = player1 
    ; S < 0, Winner = player2 
    ; S = 0, Winner = draw 
    ).

% Query example
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

#### 4. **Overall Analysis**
The code is logically structured and correctly implements the rules of rock-paper-scissors. It successfully computes the winner based on a series of moves. However, there are minor issues in the code that could be improved for clarity and robustness.

---

#### 5. **Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Typo in `scissor` (should be `scissors`) | Consistency | Replace `scissor` with `scissors` for clarity. |
| 2   | No validation for invalid moves | Potential runtime errors | Add validation to ensure only valid moves are processed. |
| 3   | No handling for empty move lists | Undefined behavior | Explicitly handle empty lists in `determine_winner`. |

---

#### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**

1. **Fix Typo**:
   ```prolog
   move(scissors).  % Instead of 'scissor'
   beats(scissors, paper).  % Instead of 'scissor'
   ```

2. **Add Move Validation**:
   ```prolog
   valid_move(X) :- move(X).
   result(X, Y, _) :- \+ valid_move(X); \+ valid_move(Y), fail.
   ```

3. **Handle Empty Lists**:
   ```prolog
   determine_winner([], [], draw).
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
       (P1Moves = []; P2Moves = []), 
       Winner = draw.
   ```

4. **Example Query with Edge Cases**:
   ```prolog
   % Test with empty lists
   query(determine_winner([], [], W)).
   % Test with invalid moves
   query(determine_winner([rock, invalid], [paper, rock], W)).
   ```

#### Final Check
- **Zero/Negative Values**: The `compute_score` predicate already handles zero and negative scores correctly.
- **Table Format and Code Blocks**: Verified for correctness.

This report provides a comprehensive analysis and actionable suggestions for improving the ProbLog implementation of rock-paper-scissors.
