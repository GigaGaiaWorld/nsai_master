### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### 1. **Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### 2. **Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, including:
- Defining the three possible moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
- Specifying the win-lose relationships (`beats/2`).
- Calculating the result of each round (`result/3`).
- Playing a sequence of moves (`play/3`).
- Computing the final score (`compute_score/2`).
- Determining the winner (`determine_winner/3`).

The purpose is to simulate a game between two players and determine the winner based on their moves.

---

#### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).

% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(paper, rock).
beats(scissor, paper).

% Calculate the result of the game
result(X, X, draw) :- move(X).
result(X, Y, win) :- beats(X, Y).
result(X, Y, lose) :- beats(Y, X).

% Play the game
play([], [], []).
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
    result(P1, P2, R),
    play(P1T, P2T, Rs).

% Compute the score
compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S).

% Determine the winner
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), 
    compute_score(Results,S), 
    ( S > 0, Winner = player1 
    ; S < , Winner = player2 
    ; S = 0, Winner = draw 
    ).

% Query
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

---

#### 4. **Overall Analysis**
The code is logically structured and meets the basic requirements of the game. However, there are minor issues in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically in the condition for `S < 0`. The test result (`determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player2) = 1.0000`) is correct, but the code could be improved for clarity and robustness.

#### 5. **Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Typo in `S < ,` (missing `0`)    | Syntax error, code won't compile | Fix to `S < 0`                              |
| 2      | No handling of invalid moves     | Undefined behavior              | Add validation for `move/1` in `result/3`   |
| 3      | No test for empty input lists    | Undefined behavior              | Add test cases for empty lists              |

---

#### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**

1. **Fix Syntax Error**:
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
       play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), 
       compute_score(Results,S), 
       ( S > 0, Winner = player1 
       ; S < 0, Winner = player2 
       ; S = 0, Winner = draw 
       ).
   ```

2. **Add Move Validation**:
   ```prolog
   result(X, Y, _) :- \+ move(X), \+ move(Y), fail.
   ```

3. **Test for Edge Cases**:
   - Empty lists: `query(determine_winner([], [], W)).`
   - Invalid moves: `query(determine_winner([rock, invalid], [paper, rock], W)).`

4. **Improve Readability**:
   - Use comments to clarify edge cases.
   - Add a helper predicate for move validation.

---

#### Final Check
- **Zero/Negative Values**: Handled correctly in `compute_score/2`.
- **Table Format**: Correct.
- **Code Blocks**: Properly formatted.

The code is functional but benefits from the suggested improvements for robustness and clarity.
