  "HASH": "FB41E2F7",
  "ErrorSummary": "Incorrect parsing of nested operations due to missing operator precedence and associativity, inconsistent application of almost_equal, and missing zero-division check.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Rewrite parse/2 rules to handle operator precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction). Add explicit zero-division checks and ensure almost_equal is applied uniformly. Example fix for division: parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :- almost_equal(N2, V2), V2 =\\= 0, almost_equal(N1, V1), parse(T, V3), almost_equal(V1 / V2, R).",
