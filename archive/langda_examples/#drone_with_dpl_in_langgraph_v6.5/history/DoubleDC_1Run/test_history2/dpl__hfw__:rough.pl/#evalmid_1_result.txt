### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Expression Parser

---

#### 1. **Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Expression Parser for Arithmetic Operations**

---

#### 2. **Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse a list of symbols representing numbers and arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and compute the result of the expression. The `detect_all/2` predicate maps image identifiers to their corresponding symbols, and the `parse/2` predicate evaluates the arithmetic expression. The `almost_equal/2` predicate ensures numerical comparisons are tolerant of floating-point inaccuracies.

The purpose is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify errors, and suggest improvements to meet the requirements.

#### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
% Detect numbers and operators
detect_number(image_0, 0).
detect_number(image_1, 1).
% ... (other detect_number facts)
detect_operator(image_plus, +).
% ... (other detect_operator facts)

% Parse expressions
parse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R).
parse([N1, +, N2 | T], R) :-
    almost_equal(N1, V1),
    parse([N2 | T], V2),
    almost_equal(V1 + V2, R).
% ... (other parse rules for -, *, /)
```

---

#### 4. **Overall Analysis**
The code partially meets the requirements but contains logical errors in the `parse/2` predicate, leading to incorrect evaluation of nested expressions. The test case `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` yields `-0.25`, which is incorrect for the expected expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`.

#### 5. **Error Summary**

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Incorrect parsing of nested operations | Results in wrong arithmetic evaluation | Modify `parse/2` to handle operator precedence and associativity correctly.    |
| 2       | Missing handling of division by zero | Potential runtime error              | Add a check for division by zero in the `/` rule.                              |
| 3       | No support for negative numbers     | Limited functionality               | Extend `detect_number/2` to handle negative values if required.                |

#### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**

##### **Logical Fix for Nested Operations**
The current implementation evaluates operations left-to-right without considering precedence. For example, `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7` should be evaluated as `(2 / 3) + 3 - (2 * 7)`. Modify the `parse/2` rules to handle precedence:

```prolog
parse([N1, *, N2 | T], R) :-
    almost_equal(N1, V1),
    parse([N2 | T], V2),
    almost_equal(V1 * V2, R).
parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :-
    almost_equal(N1, V1),
    parse([N2 | T], V2),
    V2 =\= 0, % Check for division by zero
    almost_equal(V1 / V2, R).
% Similar fixes for + and - to ensure correct precedence.
```

##### **Handling Division by Zero**
Add a guard to the division rule:
```prolog
parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :-
    almost_equal(N1, V1),
    parse([N2 | T], V2),
    V2 =\= 0,
    almost_equal(V1 / V2, R).
```

##### **Support for Negative Numbers**
Extend `detect_number/2` if negative numbers are required:
```prolog
detect_number(image_neg_1, -1).
% ... (other negative numbers)
```

---

#### **Final Checks**
- **Handling Zero/Negative Values**: The improved code now checks for division by zero and can be extended for negative numbers.
- **Formatting**: The table and code blocks are correctly formatted.
