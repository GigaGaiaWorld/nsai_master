The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. The main difference is the addition of bounds checking in the 'attempted_flap_position' rule, where 'Pos' is now clamped between 0 and 10 using 'max(0, min(10, TempPos))'. This change prevents overrun exceptions by ensuring the flap position stays within legal bounds, which explains why all 'overrun_exception' probabilities are now 0. The goal-reaching probabilities are slightly higher in the generated code due to this modification. The code structure and logic remain otherwise unchanged.
