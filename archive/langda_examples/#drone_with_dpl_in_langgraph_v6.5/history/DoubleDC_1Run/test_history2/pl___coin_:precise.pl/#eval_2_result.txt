  "ErrorSummary": "Syntax error in conditional (->/2) and improper handling of probabilistic predicate coin/1. Execution fails due to UnknownClause error.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the conditional with proper ProbLog probabilistic constructs. Define coin/1 using 0.8::coin(C). and split the recursive rule into two cases for heads/tails. Add explicit handling for CNT <= 0.",
