### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### 1. **Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### 2. **Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The goal is to model the problem in ProbLog to simulate the probabilities of winning by either keeping the original door or switching doors after the host reveals an empty door. The code should correctly reflect the rules:
1. The host always opens an empty door.
2. The host randomly opens one of the two empty doors if both are empty.
3. The probabilities of winning should align with the theoretical solution (1/3 for keeping the original door, 2/3 for switching).

#### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).
select_door(1).
member(X,[X|T]).
member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).

0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    A \= Selected,
    B \= Selected,
    A \= B,
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ prize(B).

open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    A \= Selected,
    \+ prize(A),
    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    B \= Selected,
    B \= A,
    prize(B).

win_keep :-
    select_door(Door),
    prize(Door).

win_switch :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    \+ select_door(A),
    prize(A),
    \+ open_door(A).

query(prize(_)).
query(select_door(_)).
query(win_keep).
query(win_switch).
```

---

#### 4. **Overall Analysis**
The code correctly models the Monty Hall problem, as evidenced by the test results:
- `win_keep = 0.3333` (1/3 probability).
- `win_switch = 0.6667` (2/3 probability).
- The probabilities for `prize(_)` and `select_door(1)` are also correct.

However, there are minor stylistic and structural issues that could be improved for clarity and robustness.

#### 5. **Error Summary**

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Redundant `member/2` definition | Code duplication | Remove the redundant `member/2` definition. |
| 2 | Hardcoded `select_door(1)` | Limits flexibility | Allow dynamic selection of doors. |
| 3 | No handling of edge cases (e.g., all doors have prizes) | Potential runtime errors | Add validation for edge cases. |

---

#### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**

1. **Remove Redundant `member/2` Definition**  
   The `member/2` predicate is defined twice. Remove the redundant definition:
   ```prolog
   member(X,[X|T]).
   member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).
   ```

2. **Dynamic Door Selection**  
   Replace the hardcoded `select_door(1)` with a probabilistic selection:
   ```prolog
   1/3::select_door(1) ; 1/3::select_door(2) ; 1/3::select_door(3).
   ```

3. **Edge Case Handling**  
   Add validation to ensure the host always has at least one empty door to open:
   ```prolog
   open_door(A) :-
       select_door(Selected),
       member(A, [1,2,3]),
       A \= Selected,
       \+ prize(A),
       (member(B, [1,2,3]), B \= Selected, B \= A, prize(B) -> true ; true).
   ```

4. **Code Clarity**  
   Add comments to explain the logic for future maintainability:
   ```prolog
   % Host opens a door: if both unselected doors are empty, choose randomly.
   0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
       select_door(Selected),
       member(A, [1,2,3]),
       member(B, [1,2,3]),
       A \= Selected,
       B \= Selected,
       A \= B,
       \+ prize(A),
       \+ prize(B).
   ```

#### Final Check
- **Handling Zero/Negative Values**: The code does not involve numerical values that could be zero or negative, so no additional checks are needed.
- **Table Format and Code Blocks**: Verified for correctness.

The improved code will be more robust and maintainable while preserving the correct probabilistic behavior.
