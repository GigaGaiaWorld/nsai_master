Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code is for the stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]) operation, but this is already complete in both origin_code and generated_code. The only incomplete part in origin_code was the stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) predicate, which was completed in generated_code.

Here's the formatted output:

```problog
{"HASH": "E659D458", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :- \n    sort(Stack, SortedStack)."}
```

Note that the second block doesn't have a hash since it wasn't marked with a <Langda> block in the origin_code, but I included it since it was the only actual completion in the generated_code.
