### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code is an implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle) in ProbLog. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The goal is to determine which house owns the zebra and who drinks water.

The code uses predicates like `my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`, and `nth1` to enforce the constraints. However, the test results indicate an error related to the `nth1/3` predicate.

#### **3. Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, spanish, dog, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(green, _, _, coffee, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, ukrainian, _, tea, _), Houses),
    right_of(house(green, _, _, _, _), house(ivory, _, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, snail, _, winstons), Houses),
    my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),
    nth1(3, Houses, house(_, _, _, milk, _)),  % Line 11: Error here
    nth1(1, Houses, house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)),
    next_to(house(_, _, _, _, chesterfields), house(_, _, fox, _, _), Houses),
    next_to(house(_, _, _, _, kools), house(_, _, horse, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),
    next_to(house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), house(blue, _, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses),
    unique_color(Houses),
    unique_nationality(Houses),
    unique_pet(Houses),
    unique_drink(Houses),
    unique_smoke(Houses).
```

---

#### **4. Overall Analysis**
The code attempts to model the Zebra Puzzle using ProbLog, but it fails due to the absence of the `nth1/3` predicate in the ProbLog environment. The rest of the logic appears correct, but the missing predicate prevents the code from executing.

#### **5. Error Summary**

| **No.** | **Problem**                     | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Missing `nth1/3` predicate      | Code fails to execute               | Replace `nth1/3` with a custom implementation or use an alternative predicate. |
| 2       | Typo in `lucky_strikes`         | Potential runtime error             | Correct the typo to `lucky_strikes`.                                           |
| 3       | Missing `unique_*` predicates   | Constraints not enforced            | Define predicates like `unique_color/1` to enforce uniqueness.                 |

---

#### **6. Improvement Suggestions**

##### **Fix for `nth1/3`**
The `nth1/3` predicate is not available in ProbLog. Replace it with a custom implementation:
```prolog
nth1(1, [X|_], X).
nth1(N, [_|T], X) :- N > 1, N1 is N - 1, nth1(N1, T, X).
```

##### **Fix for Typo**
Correct the typo in `lucky_strikes`:
```prolog
my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses).
```

##### **Define `unique_*` Predicates**
Add the following predicates to enforce uniqueness:
```prolog
unique_color(Houses) :-
    findall(Color, member(house(Color, _, _, _, _), Houses),
    sort(Colors, UniqueColors),
    length(Colors, 5).

unique_nationality(Houses) :-
    findall(Nationality, member(house(_, Nationality, _, _, _), Houses),
    sort(Nationalities, UniqueNationalities),
    length(Nationalities, 5).
% Similarly for unique_pet, unique_drink, unique_smoke.
```

---

#### **Final Notes**
- The corrected code should now execute without errors.
- Ensure all uniqueness constraints are properly defined.
- Test the code with the corrected predicates to verify the solution.
