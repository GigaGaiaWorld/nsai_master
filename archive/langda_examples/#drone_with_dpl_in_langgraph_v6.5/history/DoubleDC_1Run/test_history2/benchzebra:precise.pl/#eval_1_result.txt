  "ErrorSummary": "The code block enforces only one constraint (the owner of the red house is English) and lacks all other required constraints, leading to multiple invalid solutions.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Add all 14 rules as predicates to enforce constraints. For example, add predicates like `my_member(house(_, spanish, dog, _, _), Houses)` for the Spanish owning a dog, and use `right_of/3` for spatial relationships like the green house being to the right of the ivory house.",
