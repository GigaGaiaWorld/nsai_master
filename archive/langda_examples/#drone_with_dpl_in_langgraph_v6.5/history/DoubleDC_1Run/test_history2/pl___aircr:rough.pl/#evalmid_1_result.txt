### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system. The system aims to adjust the flap position from an initial value (6) to a target value (4) over a series of time steps, considering factors like actuator strength, wind effects, and potential overrun exceptions. The purpose is to ensure the flap reaches the goal position without violating legal bounds (0 to 10).

---

#### **3. Original Code Excerpt**  
Here is the problematic section of the code (with line numbers for reference):

```prolog
% Line 33: Attempted flap position calculation
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time-1,
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
    goal(Target),
    (Target > PrevPos -> Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect ; Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect).
```

---

#### **4. Overall Analysis**  
The code is logically structured to model the flap controller system, but it contains syntactic and semantic errors that prevent successful execution. The primary issue is a typo in the predicate name (`goal_reached` vs. `goal_reached`), which leads to an `UnknownClause` error. Additionally, the code lacks robustness in handling edge cases (e.g., zero or negative values for `Time` or `Pos`).

#### **5. Error Summary**  

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Typo in predicate name (`goal_reached` vs. `goal_reached`) | Execution fails with `UnknownClause` error | Correct the predicate name to `goal_reached`.                                  |
| 2       | No handling for `Time = 0` edge case | Potential runtime errors            | Add a guard clause to ensure `Time > 0` in `attempted_flap_position`.          |
| 3       | No validation for `Pos` bounds       | Overrun exceptions may not be caught | Explicitly check `Pos` bounds in `attempted_flap_position`.                    |

#### **6. Improvement Suggestions**  

##### **6.1 Fix Typo in Predicate Name**  
Replace `goal_reached` with `goal_reached` in the `attempted_flap_position` rule.

##### **6.2 Add Edge Case Handling**  
Ensure `Time` is valid and `Pos` is within bounds. Hereâ€™s the corrected and improved code:

```prolog
attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time - 1,
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
    goal(Target),
    (Target > PrevPos -> 
        Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect ; 
        Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect
    ),
    % Ensure Pos is within legal bounds
    legal_flap_position(Pos).
```

##### **6.3 Validate Inputs**  
Add a rule to handle `Time = 0` explicitly:

```prolog
flap_position(0, 6). % Initial position
```

##### **6.4 Test Cases**  
Include test cases for edge scenarios:
- `Time = 0`: Ensure initial position is set correctly.
- `Pos` out of bounds: Verify `overrun_exception` is triggered.

---

#### **Final Checks**  
- **Handling Zero/Negative Values**: The improved code explicitly checks `Time > 0` and validates `Pos` bounds.  
- **Table and Code Blocks**: The table and code blocks are correctly formatted in Markdown.
