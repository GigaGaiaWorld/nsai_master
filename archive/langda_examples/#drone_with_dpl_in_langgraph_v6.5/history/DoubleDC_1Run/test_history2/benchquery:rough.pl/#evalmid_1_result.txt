### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Population Density Query

---

#### 1. **Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### 2. **Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% of each other). The `query_pop/1` predicate calculates the population density for each country and compares pairs to find matches.

---

#### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
density(Country, Density) :- 
    pop(Country, Pop), 
    area(Country, Area), 
    Density is (Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000).

query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :- 
    density(Country1, Density1), 
    density(Country2, Density2), 
    Country1 @< Country2, 
    abs(Density1 - Density2) =< 0.05 * max(Density1, Density2).
```

---

#### 4. **Overall Analysis**
The code generally meets the requirements by:
- Calculating population density correctly.
- Comparing pairs of countries to ensure no duplicates (using `Country1 @< Country2`).
- Ensuring the density difference is within 5%.

However, the test results reveal potential issues with the density calculation or comparison logic, as some pairs may not meet the 5% threshold despite being returned as valid.

#### 5. **Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                                                                 | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect density calculation   | The formula `(Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000)` may not scale correctly. | Use `Density is (Pop * 1000) / Area` for accurate density per square mile. |
| 2   | 5% threshold not strictly enforced | Some results (e.g., `china` and `france`) exceed the 5% difference.   | Recheck the comparison logic or adjust the threshold.                      |
| 3   | No handling of zero/negative values | Division by zero or negative areas/populations could cause errors.    | Add guards to ensure `Area > 0` and `Pop > 0`.                             |

#### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**

##### a. **Fix Density Calculation**
The current formula scales the population and area unnecessarily. Simplify it to:
```prolog
density(Country, Density) :- 
    pop(Country, Pop), 
    area(Country, Area), 
    Area > 0,  % Guard against division by zero
    Density is (Pop * 1000) / Area.  % Correct scaling
```

##### b. **Strict 5% Threshold Enforcement**
Ensure the comparison logic is accurate:
```prolog
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :- 
    density(Country1, Density1), 
    density(Country2, Density2), 
    Country1 @< Country2, 
    MaxDensity is max(Density1, Density2),
    abs(Density1 - Density2) =< 0.05 * MaxDensity.
```

##### c. **Handle Edge Cases**
Add guards for invalid inputs:
```prolog
density(Country, Density) :- 
    pop(Country, Pop), Pop > 0, 
    area(Country, Area), Area > 0, 
    Density is (Pop * 1000) / Area.
```

#### 7. **Final Checks**
- **Zero/Negative Values**: The improved code now handles these cases.
- **Formatting**: Tables and code blocks are correctly formatted.
