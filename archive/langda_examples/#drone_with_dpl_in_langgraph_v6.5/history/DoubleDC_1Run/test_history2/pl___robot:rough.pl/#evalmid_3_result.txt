### 1. **Document Title**  
**ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Key Pickup Scenario**

---

### 2. **Background and Purpose**  
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate a robot picking up a key in a dynamic environment. The scenario involves probabilistic events such as the robot successfully picking up the key, the key being slippery, and the robot moving between locations. The goal is to ensure the robot carries the key to a specified location (`loc2`) by time `s(s(s(0)))`.

### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**  
```prolog
% Key pickup and carrying logic
carrying(key,s(T)) :- pickup_succeeds(T), at(key, Pos, T), at(robot, Pos, T).
carrying(key,s(T)) :- carrying(key, T), \+ drops(key, T).

% Probabilistic events
0.7::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.3::pickup_fails(T).
0.6::drop_slippery_key(T); 0.4::holds_slippery_key(T).
0.2::fumbles_key(T); 0.8::retains_key(T).
0.75::stays_slippery(T); 0.25::stops_being_slippery(T).
0.5::initially_slippery(key); 0.5::initially_unslippery(key).

% Movement and key location
at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- \+ goto_action(T), at(robot,Pos,T).
at(key,Pos,T) :- carrying(key,T), at(robot,Pos,T).
at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- \+ carrying(key,s(T)), at(key,Pos,T).

% Actions
do(goto(loc1),0).
do(pickup(key),s(0)).
do(goto(loc2),s(0)).

% Initial state
at(key,loc1,0).
at(robot,loc0,0).

% Queries
query(carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))).
query(at(_,_,s(s(s(0))))).
```

### 4. **Overall Analysis**  
The code fails to meet the requirement of the robot carrying the key to `loc2` by time `s(s(s(0)))`. The test results show:
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`: The robot is not carrying the key at the target time.
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 1.0000`: The key remains at `loc1`, indicating the robot did not pick it up or move it.

The root cause lies in the interaction between the robot's actions and the probabilistic events governing key pickup and retention.

### 5. **Error Summary**  

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                                   | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | `pickup_succeeds(T)` probability is too low (0.7). | Robot fails to pick up the key.               | Increase the probability (e.g., `0.8::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.2::pickup_fails(T)` as per `<Langda>`). |
| 2       | No explicit handling of `goto_succeeds(T)` for movement. | Robot may not reach `loc1` to pick up the key. | Add a rule to update robot position on successful `goto`.                      |
| 3       | Key location logic does not account for robot movement. | Key remains at `loc1` even if robot moves.    | Update `at(key,Pos,T)` to reflect robot's movement with the key.               |

### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**  

#### **Code Fixes**  
1. **Increase Pickup Success Probability**  
   Replace:
   ```prolog
   0.7::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.3::pickup_fails(T).
   ```
   With:
   ```prolog
   0.8::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.2::pickup_fails(T).
   ```

2. **Handle Robot Movement Success**  
   Add:
   ```prolog
   at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_succeeds(T), do(goto(Pos),T).
   ```

3. **Update Key Location Logic**  
   Replace:
   ```prolog
   at(key,Pos,T) :- carrying(key,T), at(robot,Pos,T).
   ```
   With:
   ```prolog
   at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- carrying(key,s(T)), at(robot,Pos,s(T)).
   ```

#### **Example of Improved Code**  
```prolog
% Updated pickup probability
0.8::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.2::pickup_fails(T).

% Handle successful movement
at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_succeeds(T), do(goto(Pos),T).

% Updated key location logic
at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- carrying(key,s(T)), at(robot,Pos,s(T)).
```

### **Final Checks**  
- **Zero/Negative Values**: The code does not involve zero or negative values, so no additional handling is required.  
- **Formatting**: Tables and code blocks are correctly formatted.  

This revised code should address the test failures and meet the requirements.
