Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code blocks that correspond to the <langda> sections. In this case, there's only one <langda> section in the origin_code, and its corresponding completed code in the generated_code is the probability line for pickup_succeeds/pickup_fails which changed from 0.7/0.3 to 0.8/0.2.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "D92532A0","Code": "0.8::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.2::pickup_fails(T)."}
```
