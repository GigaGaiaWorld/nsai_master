Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> section in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "D92532A0", "Code": "0.8::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.2::pickup_fails(T)."}
```

The only change in the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> section (which had the requirement "Pick up the key") is the probability distribution for pickup_succeeds/1 and pickup_fails/1, which was modified from 0.7/0.3 to 0.8/0.2. All other code blocks in the generated version either match the original or are unrelated to the <langda> section.
