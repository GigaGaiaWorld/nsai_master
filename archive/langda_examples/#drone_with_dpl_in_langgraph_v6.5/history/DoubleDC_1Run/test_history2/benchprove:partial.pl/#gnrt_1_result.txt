Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. The <Langda> section was about defining expand rules, and in the generated_code we can see the corresponding completed code.

Here's the formatted output:

```problog
{"HASH": "230CB29D", "Code": "expand(double(X), Y) :- number(X), Y is X * 2.\nexpand(double(0), 0).\nexpand(double(-X), Y) :- Y is -X * 2."}
```
