Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code blocks that correspond to the <langda> sections. In this case, there's only one <langda> block in the origin_code, and its corresponding implementation in the generated_code is the expand/2 predicate definitions.

Here's the formatted output:

```problog
{"HASH": "230CB29D","Code": "expand(double(X), Y) :-\n    number(X),\n    Y is X * 2.\nexpand(double(0), 0).\nexpand(double(-X), Y) :-\n    Y is -X * 2."}
```
