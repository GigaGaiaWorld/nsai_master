### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### 1. **Document Title**
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### 2. **Background and Purpose**
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) to sort a list of integers. The algorithm works by recursively inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation and identify any potential issues.

---

#### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
1. insertion_sort([], []).
2. insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
3.     insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
4.     insert(H, SortedTail, Sorted).
5. insert(X, [], [X]).
6. insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :- X =< Y.
7. insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :- X > Y, insert(X, Ys, Zs).
```

---

#### 4. **Overall Analysis**
The code correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm and passes the provided test case (`insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`). The logic is sound, and the predicates are well-defined. However, the evaluation should also consider edge cases, such as lists with zero or negative values, to ensure robustness.

---

#### 5. **Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | No explicit handling of negative values | Potential incorrect sorting for negative numbers | Ensure the comparison predicates (`=<`, `>`) work as expected for all integers. |
| 2   | No test case for empty list | Lack of validation for edge cases | Add test cases for empty lists and single-element lists. |
| 3   | No test case for duplicate values | Potential issues with duplicate elements | Include test cases with duplicate values (e.g., `[3, 1, 1, 2]`). |

---

#### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**
1. **Test Cases**:
   - Empty list: `insertion_sort([], X)` should return `X = []`.
   - Single-element list: `insertion_sort([5], X)` should return `X = [5]`.
   - Negative values: `insertion_sort([-1, -3, 2], X)` should return `X = [-3, -1, 2]`.
   - Duplicate values: `insertion_sort([3, 1, 1, 2], X)` should return `X = [1, 1, 2, 3]`.

2. **Code Example for Edge Cases**:
   ```prolog
   % Test for empty list
   ?- insertion_sort([], X).
   X = [].

   % Test for single-element list
   ?- insertion_sort([5], X).
   X = [5].

   % Test for negative values
   ?- insertion_sort([-1, -3, 2], X).
   X = [-3, -1, 2].

   % Test for duplicate values
   ?- insertion_sort([3, 1, 1, 2], X).
   X = [1, 1, 2, 3].
   ```

3. **Code Robustness**:
   - The current implementation handles all cases correctly, but explicit testing ensures reliability.

---

#### Final Check
- **Handling Zero or Negative Values**: The code implicitly handles these cases because Prolog's comparison operators (`=<`, `>`) work for all integers, including zero and negatives.
- **Table Format and Code Blocks**: The table and code blocks are correctly formatted for clarity.

---

#### Conclusion
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is correct and meets the requirements. However, additional test cases for edge scenarios (empty lists, single-element lists, negatives, and duplicates) are recommended to ensure robustness. No changes to the code logic are necessary.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
