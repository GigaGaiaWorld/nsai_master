### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Population Density Query**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query output format is `[C1, D1, C2, D2]`, where `C1` and `C2` are country names, and `D1` and `D2` are their respective population densities. The code uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division and approximates density equality with the inequality `19 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `19 * D2 < 21 * D1`.

---

#### **3. Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 @< C2,
    19 * D1 < 21 * D2,
    19 * D2 < 21 * D1.

density(C, D) :-
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    A > 0,
    D is (P * 100) // A.
```

---

#### **4. Overall Analysis**
The code generally meets the requirements but has some logical and structural issues:
- **Logical Issues**: The inequality `19 * D1 < 21 * D2` is not equivalent to the requirement `20 * D1 < 21 * D2`. This discrepancy affects the accuracy of the results.
- **Structural Issues**: The code does not handle cases where `A = 0` (division by zero) or negative values, though the `A > 0` check prevents division by zero.
- **Semantic Issues**: The test results include pairs like `[china, 244, indonesia, 223]`, where the densities are not approximately equal (244 vs. 223).

#### **5. Error Summary**

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                                                                 | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Incorrect inequality (`19 * D1 < 21 * D2`) | Results in incorrect pairs of countries being identified as having equal densities. | Replace with `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1`.                     |
| 2       | No handling of negative values       | Negative populations or areas could lead to incorrect density calculations.         | Add checks for `P > 0` and `A > 0` in the `density` predicate.                 |
| 3       | Test results include unequal pairs   | The query returns pairs with densities that are not approximately equal.            | Adjust the inequality to ensure stricter equality (e.g., `20 * D1 < 21 * D2`). |

#### **6. Improvement Suggestions**
Here is the corrected code with improvements:

```prolog
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 @< C2,
    20 * D1 < 21 * D2,
    20 * D2 < 21 * D1.

density(C, D) :-
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    P > 0,
    A > 0,
    D is (P * 100) // A.
```

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Corrected Inequality**: The inequalities now use `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1` to better approximate `D1/D2 < 1.05`.
2. **Handling Negative Values**: Added `P > 0` to ensure populations are positive.
3. **Stricter Equality**: The adjusted inequalities ensure that only pairs with approximately equal densities are returned.

#### **Final Checks**
- **Zero/Negative Values**: The improved code handles zero and negative values by checking `P > 0` and `A > 0`.
- **Formatting**: The table and code blocks are correctly formatted in Markdown.
