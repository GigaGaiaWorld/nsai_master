### 1. **Document Title**  
**Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

### 2. **Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries, their populations, and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query output format is `[C1, D1, C2, D2]`, where `C1` and `C2` are countries, and `D1` and `D2` are their respective population densities. The code uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division and approximates density equality with the inequality `20×D1 < 21×D2`.

### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**  
```prolog
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 \= C2,
    20 * D1 < 21 * D2,
    20 * D2 < 21 * D1.

density(C, D) :- 
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    D is (P * 100) // A.
```

---

### 4. **Overall Analysis**  
The code generally meets the requirements, but the testing results reveal some logical inconsistencies in the density comparisons. The inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1` are intended to approximate `D1/D2 ≈ 1.05`, but some test results (e.g., `[italy, 477, philippines, 461]`) do not satisfy this condition. The root cause is the strictness of the inequalities, which may exclude valid pairs or include invalid ones.

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                                                                 | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Inequality too strict                | Some valid pairs are excluded (e.g., `[italy, 477, philippines, 461]`).   | Relax the inequalities to `19 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `19 * D2 < 21 * D1`.        |
| 2       | No handling of zero/negative areas   | Division by zero or negative densities may occur.                         | Add guards to ensure `A > 0` in the `density` predicate.                      |
| 3       | Redundant pairs in results           | Pairs like `[C1, D1, C2, D2]` and `[C2, D2, C1, D1]` are both included.   | Add a constraint like `C1 @< C2` to avoid duplicates.                         |

### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**  

#### **Revised Code**  
```prolog
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 @< C2,  % Avoid duplicate pairs
    19 * D1 < 21 * D2,
    19 * D2 < 21 * D1.

density(C, D) :- 
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    A > 0,  % Guard against zero/negative areas
    D is (P * 100) // A.
```

#### **Explanation of Changes**  
1. **Relaxed Inequalities**:  
   - Changed `20` to `19` to widen the acceptable range of density ratios.  
   - This ensures pairs like `[italy, 477, philippines, 461]` are included.  

2. **Handling Zero/Negative Areas**:  
   - Added `A > 0` to prevent division by zero or negative densities.  

3. **Avoiding Redundant Pairs**:  
   - Added `C1 @< C2` to ensure each pair is listed only once.

### **Final Checks**  
- **Zero/Negative Values**: The revised code now handles zero or negative areas by explicitly checking `A > 0`.  
- **Table Format and Code Blocks**: The tables and code blocks are correctly formatted in Markdown.
