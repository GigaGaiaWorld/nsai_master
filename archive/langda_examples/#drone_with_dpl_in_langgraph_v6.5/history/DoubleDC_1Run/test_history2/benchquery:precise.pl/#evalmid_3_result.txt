### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Population Density Query

---

#### 1. **Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Comparison**

---

#### 2. **Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to query a database of countries, their populations, and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query uses the inequality `20×D1 < 21×D2` to approximate a density ratio of `D1/D2 < 1.05`, avoiding division and decimals. The output format is `[C1,D1,C2,D2]`, where `C1` and `C2` are countries, and `D1` and `D2` are their respective population densities.

---

#### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**  
```prolog
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 @< C2,
    20 * D1 < 21 * D2,
    20 * D2 < 21 * D1.

density(C,D) :-
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    A > 0,
    D is (P * 100) // A.
```

---

#### 4. **Overall Analysis**  
The code generally meets the requirements by correctly calculating population densities and comparing them using the specified inequalities. However, the test results reveal some discrepancies in the output, which may indicate issues with the density calculation or the comparison logic. The code does not handle edge cases such as zero or negative areas, which could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

#### 5. **Error Summary**  

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Density calculation uses integer division (`//`) | Loss of precision in density values | Use floating-point division (`/`) for more accurate comparisons.              |
| 2       | No handling of zero or negative areas | Potential division by zero or incorrect densities | Add validation to skip or flag countries with invalid areas.                  |
| 3       | Test case `[ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]` fails the inequality check | Incorrect results due to integer division | Recalculate densities using floating-point division and adjust inequalities.   |

#### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**  

##### **Handling Zero or Negative Areas**  
Add a validation check to ensure the area is positive before calculating density:  
```prolog
density(C,D) :-
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    A > 0,  % Skip invalid areas
    D is (P * 100) / A.  % Use floating-point division
```

##### **Floating-Point Division**  
Replace integer division (`//`) with floating-point division (`/`) to avoid precision loss:  
```prolog
D is (P * 100) / A.
```

##### **Adjust Inequalities**  
Ensure the inequalities account for floating-point values:  
```prolog
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 @< C2,
    20 * D1 < 21 * D2,
    20 * D2 < 21 * D1.
```

##### **Example of Improved Code**  
```prolog
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 @< C2,
    20 * D1 < 21 * D2,
    20 * D2 < 21 * D1.

density(C,D) :-
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    A > 0,  % Skip invalid areas
    D is (P * 100) / A.  % Use floating-point division
```

#### **Final Checks**  
- **Edge Cases**: The improved code now handles zero or negative areas by skipping them.  
- **Table Format**: The table is correctly formatted.  
- **Code Blocks**: All code blocks are properly highlighted and indented.  

This report provides a comprehensive analysis and actionable suggestions for improving the ProbLog code.
