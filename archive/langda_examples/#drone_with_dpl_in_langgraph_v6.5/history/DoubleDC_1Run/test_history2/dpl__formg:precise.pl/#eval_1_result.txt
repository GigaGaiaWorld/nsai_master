### Explanation:
1. **HASH 95E704F2**:  
   - The code block correctly implements the requirements:  
     - Gets the length of the list (`length(List, Len)`).  
     - Checks the recursive boundary (`Len > 1`).  
     - Splits the list into `Left` and `Right` (`split_list(List, Left, Right)`).  
   - No errors or inefficiencies were found.  

2. **HASH 26E82D5D**:  
   - The code block correctly implements the requirements:  
     - Recursively sorts the left half (`merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft)`).  
     - Recursively sorts the right half (`merge_sort(Right, SortedRight)`).  
     - Merges the sorted sublists (`merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)`).  
   - No errors or inefficiencies were found.  

Both modules are correct and do not require regeneration. The overall merge sort implementation is functional, as confirmed by the test case.
