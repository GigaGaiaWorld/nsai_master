### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Population Density Query

---

#### 1. **Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Comparison**

---

#### 2. **Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The `query_pop/1` predicate calculates the density for two countries and checks if their densities fall within a specific range (20% tolerance). The code uses integer arithmetic for density calculations.

---

#### 3. **Original Code Excerpt**
```prolog
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :-
    density(C1,D1),
    density(C2,D2),
    D1 > D2,
    T1 is 20*D1,
    T2 is 21*D2,
    T1 < T2.

density(C,D) :-
    pop(C,P),
    area(C,A),
    D is (P*100)//A.
```

---

#### 4. **Overall Analysis**
The code generally meets the requirements of comparing population densities. However, the test results reveal inconsistencies in the logic for determining "approximately equal" densities. The current implementation uses a fixed multiplier (20 and 21) for comparison, which may not accurately reflect the intended tolerance (e.g., 20% difference). Additionally, the integer division (`//`) in the `density/2` predicate may lead to loss of precision.

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                                                                 | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Fixed multipliers (20, 21)           | Inaccurate tolerance calculation for density comparison.                   | Replace with a percentage-based tolerance (e.g., `D1 * 0.8 < D2 < D1 * 1.2`). |
| 2       | Integer division (`//`)              | Loss of precision in density calculations.                                 | Use floating-point division (`/`) for more accurate results.                   |
| 3       | No handling of zero/negative areas   | Potential division by zero or incorrect densities for invalid inputs.      | Add guards to ensure `A > 0` in `density/2`.                                  |

#### 6. **Improvement Suggestions**

##### **Specific Code Fixes**
1. **Replace Fixed Multipliers with Percentage Tolerance**:
   ```prolog
   query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :-
       density(C1,D1),
       density(C2,D2),
       D1 > D2,
       D2 > D1 * 0.8.
   ```

2. **Use Floating-Point Division**:
   ```prolog
   density(C,D) :-
       pop(C,P),
       area(C,A),
       A > 0,  % Guard against zero/negative area
       D is (P*100)/A.
   ```

3. **Add Input Validation**:
   ```prolog
   density(C,D) :-
       pop(C,P),
       P >= 0,  % Ensure non-negative population
       area(C,A),
       A > 0,   % Ensure positive area
       D is (P*100)/A.
   ```

##### **Handling Edge Cases**
- **Zero/Negative Values**: The improved `density/2` predicate now includes guards to ensure valid inputs (`P >= 0`, `A > 0`).
- **Precision**: Floating-point division ensures more accurate density calculations.

---

#### **Final Checks**
- **Examples of Handling Zero/Negative Values**: The updated `density/2` predicate explicitly checks for `A > 0` and `P >= 0`.
- **Table Format and Code Blocks**: Verified for correctness and readability.
