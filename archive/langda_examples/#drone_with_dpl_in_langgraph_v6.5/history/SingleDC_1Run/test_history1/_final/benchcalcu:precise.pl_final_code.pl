Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there are some issues. The generated code incorrectly uses `sumdigit(0, B, C2, C, C3)` instead of `sumdigit(C2, 0, B, C, 0)` for the hundreds place addition, which leads to incorrect results. Additionally, the generated code includes unnecessary comments and formatting inconsistencies. The running results are not consistent, as the original code produces valid solutions while the generated code returns a probability of 0.0000, indicating no valid solutions were found.
