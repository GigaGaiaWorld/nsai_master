Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the constraints and logic of the original zebra puzzle. The only minor discrepancy is the use of 'snail' instead of 'snails' in the generated code, which does not affect the overall logic or result. The generated code includes helpful comments that clarify each constraint, enhancing readability. Both codes produce the same result, confirming their functional equivalence.
