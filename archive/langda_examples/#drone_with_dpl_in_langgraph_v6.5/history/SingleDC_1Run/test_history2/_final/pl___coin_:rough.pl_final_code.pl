problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5. 

***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause by using 'coin(C)' without properly grounding the variable C. This causes a runtime error. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic coin flips by using a conditional structure that properly grounds the probabilistic choices. The generated code also changes the logic structure by removing the disjunction and introducing an unnecessary variable C. The running results are inconsistent as the generated code fails to execute at all due to the error.
