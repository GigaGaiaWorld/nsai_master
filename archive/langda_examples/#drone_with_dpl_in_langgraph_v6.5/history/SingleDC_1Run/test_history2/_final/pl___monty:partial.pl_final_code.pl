The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It accurately models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions and rules. The main differences are in formatting and the explicit addition of 'A \= B' in the conditions, which was implicitly handled by 'A < B' in the original code. Both versions produce identical results, confirming their equivalence.
