  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both pieces of code define the same digit facts and an addition predicate that sums the values of two digits. The only difference is the variable naming in the addition predicate (X2/Y2 in original vs A/B in generated), which does not affect the logic or outcome. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same output for the query addition(img_5,img_6,Z)."
