  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the logic to find countries with approximately equal population density. The main difference is the addition of 'C1 \\= C2' to ensure the same country is not compared with itself, which is an improvement. The logic for comparing densities (20 * D1 < 21 * D2 and 20 * D2 < 21 * D1) is equivalent to the original but expressed differently. The running results are consistent, though the generated code produces more results due to the bidirectional comparison (e.g., [china, 244, france, 246] and [france, 246, china, 244])."
