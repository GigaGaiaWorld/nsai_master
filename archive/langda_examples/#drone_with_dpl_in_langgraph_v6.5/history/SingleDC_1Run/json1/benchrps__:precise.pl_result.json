  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it contains a syntax error in the 'determine_winner' predicate where an arrow '->' is incorrectly used instead of a comma ','. This causes the code to be invalid and results in an error during execution. The original code runs successfully and produces the expected result, while the generated code fails due to the syntax error."
