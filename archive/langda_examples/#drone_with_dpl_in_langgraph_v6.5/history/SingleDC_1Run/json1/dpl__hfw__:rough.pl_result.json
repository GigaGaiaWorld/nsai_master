It lacks several crucial parsing rules for different operators (-, *, /) and only includes a simplified version for the + operator. This results in the code being unable to properly evaluate the given expression, leading to an incorrect result (0.0000) instead of the expected -10.333333333333332. The generated code does not meet the requirements as it fails to handle all specified operations."
