  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main differences are in formatting and minor syntactic variations, such as the placement of conditions in some predicates. The generated code correctly maintains all the probabilistic rules and queries, and the logic for calculating flap positions and exceptions remains intact. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code produces the same output as the original."
