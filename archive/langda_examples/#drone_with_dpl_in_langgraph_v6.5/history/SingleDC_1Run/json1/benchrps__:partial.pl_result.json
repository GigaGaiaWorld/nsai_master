  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. However, there is a minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for the 'draw' case. The original code correctly computes the score as 'S is S1', while the generated code incorrectly uses 'compute_score(Rs, S)' which will not properly propagate the score. Despite this, the running results are consistent because the specific query used doesn't trigger this bug (the score difference is large enough to not be affected by this miscalculation in draws)."
