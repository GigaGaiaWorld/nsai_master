  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has some issues. The main problem is in the 'parse' predicate for addition, where it introduces unnecessary variables V1 and V2, which disrupts the logic flow. Additionally, the generated code does not include the complete set of parse rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are present in the original code. This incompleteness leads to incorrect results. The running results are inconsistent, with the generated code failing to compute the correct value for the query."
