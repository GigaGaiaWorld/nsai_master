  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It simplifies some conditions in the `open_door` clauses by removing redundant checks and ensuring the doors are distinct (A \\= B). The results are consistent with the original, showing the same probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors. However, the generated code could be more readable with consistent indentation and spacing."
