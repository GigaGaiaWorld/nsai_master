  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog. The only differences are in the naming of the predicate 'insert_element' vs 'insert', which does not affect the logic or outcome. The generated code is also well-commented, enhancing readability. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list."
