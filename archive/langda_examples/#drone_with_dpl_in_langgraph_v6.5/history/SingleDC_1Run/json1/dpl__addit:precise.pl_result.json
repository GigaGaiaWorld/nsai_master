  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The code is correct and meets the requirements, demonstrating consistency with the original code's logic while adding more complex functionality. The running results are correct and consistent with the expected behavior."
