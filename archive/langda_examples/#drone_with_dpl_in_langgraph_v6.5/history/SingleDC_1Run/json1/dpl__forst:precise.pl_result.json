  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The sorting logic has been simplified to handle exactly three elements, which is a valid approach but less general than the original insertion sort. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming functional consistency. However, the generated code lacks the general insertion sort implementation, which might be a limitation if sorting more than three elements is required."
