  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct in terms of syntax and logic, but it introduces a critical issue in the 'play_round' predicate by using semicolons (OR) instead of separate clauses. This causes the predicate to generate multiple results (win, lose, draw) for each move pair, leading to incorrect probabilities in the output. The original code correctly handles each case with separate clauses. While the form of the generated code is valid, its execution produces inconsistent results compared to the original."
