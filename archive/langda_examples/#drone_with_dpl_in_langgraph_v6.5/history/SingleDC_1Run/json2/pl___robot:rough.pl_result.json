  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues compared to the original. First, the 'carrying' predicate is simplified incorrectly, missing conditions like 'do(pickup(key),T)' and incorrectly using 'retains_key(T)' instead of checking for putdown/pickup actions. Second, the 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))' predicate is missing a case for failed goto actions. These changes affect the logic and results. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results with the original."
