  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both pieces of code define the same digit facts and the addition predicate, which performs the same arithmetic operation. The only difference is the variable naming in the addition predicate (X2 and Y2 in the original code vs. A and B in the generated code), which does not affect the logic or the result. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same output for the query."
