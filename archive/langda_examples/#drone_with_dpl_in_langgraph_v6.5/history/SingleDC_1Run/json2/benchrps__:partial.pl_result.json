  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same basic rules for rock-paper-scissors and the logic for determining the game result. However, there is a minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for the 'draw' case. The original code correctly updates the score by passing S1 to S, while the generated code incorrectly passes Rs to S. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output for the given query."
