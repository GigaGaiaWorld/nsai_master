  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle multi-digit numbers and 'multi_addition' to perform addition on these numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly processes lists of images representing multi-digit numbers and performs the addition accurately. The running results of both codes are consistent with their respective functionalities, with the original code handling single-digit addition and the generated code handling multi-digit addition."
