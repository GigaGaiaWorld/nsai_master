  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a notable difference in the 'implies' predicate implementation. The original code correctly implements P ⇒ Q as 'P is unprovable or Q is provable', while the generated code incorrectly implements it as 'P is provable and Q is provable'. Despite this logical difference, the running results are consistent for the given queries because the specific test cases happen to work with both implementations. The rest of the code is correctly generated and matches the original functionality."
