  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference lies in the reformatting of the 'attempted_flap_position' rule, which has been rewritten for clarity but maintains the same logical structure and behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected requirements."
