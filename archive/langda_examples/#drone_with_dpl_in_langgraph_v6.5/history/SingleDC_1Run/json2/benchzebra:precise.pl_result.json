  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and does not meet the expectations. It only includes one constraint (the English person in the red house) from the original code, missing all other constraints that define the full zebra puzzle. The form is valid Prolog syntax, but it's not a complete solution. The results show multiple possible configurations with unbound variables, demonstrating that the puzzle wasn't properly constrained."
