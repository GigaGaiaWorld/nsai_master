  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there are some formatting issues and a critical logical error in the generated code. The generated code incorrectly includes 'Carry3 = 0' as part of the main predicate, which was not present in the original code. This addition disrupts the logic and results in no valid solutions being found, as evidenced by the run result showing 0.0000 probability for any solution. The original code correctly produces multiple valid solutions."
