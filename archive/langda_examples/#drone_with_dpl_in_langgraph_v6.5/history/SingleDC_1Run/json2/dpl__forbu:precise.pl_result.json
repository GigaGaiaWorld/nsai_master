  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the definition of the swap predicate: the original code uses negation as failure (\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)) for the swap case, while the generated code directly checks X > Y. This change does not affect the logic or the result. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
