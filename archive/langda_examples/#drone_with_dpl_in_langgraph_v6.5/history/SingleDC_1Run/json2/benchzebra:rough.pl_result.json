  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It successfully replicates the logic of the original zebra puzzle solution. The main differences are in the organization of helper predicates (my_member, next_to, right_of), but these changes do not affect the overall behavior. The generated code is slightly more concise in defining 'next_to' by reusing 'right_of', which is a valid optimization. Both codes produce identical results."
