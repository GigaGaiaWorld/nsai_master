  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that can handle lists of images to form multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate that adds these multi-digit numbers. This is a valid extension and the code is syntactically correct. The running result correctly shows the addition of 79 and 312 to get 391, demonstrating that the generated code works as intended. The generated code is consistent with the original in terms of style and approach, but offers enhanced functionality."
