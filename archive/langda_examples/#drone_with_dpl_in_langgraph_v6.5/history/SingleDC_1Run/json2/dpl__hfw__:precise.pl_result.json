  "final_report": "The generated code is syntactically valid and follows the structure of the original code. However, it modifies the parsing logic for subtraction and division operations, leading to different results. The original code handles subtraction by converting it into a multiplication with -1, while the generated code directly performs subtraction. This change in logic causes the running results to differ. The generated code's result (-0.25) is incorrect compared to the original code's result (-10.333333333333332)."
