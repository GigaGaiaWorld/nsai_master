  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the essential components, including the member/2 predicate, the basic meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, and the examples and queries. The only minor differences are formatting and spacing, which do not affect functionality. The generated code produces the same results as the original code, indicating that it meets the requirements."
