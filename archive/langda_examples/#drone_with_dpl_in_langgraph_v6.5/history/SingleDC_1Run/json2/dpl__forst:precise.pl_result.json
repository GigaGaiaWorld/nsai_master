  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The sorting logic has been simplified using min_list and max_list, which is a valid approach. However, the generated code lacks the insertion_sort predicate used in the original code, replacing it with a custom sort3 predicate. This change is acceptable but should be noted. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating functional consistency."
