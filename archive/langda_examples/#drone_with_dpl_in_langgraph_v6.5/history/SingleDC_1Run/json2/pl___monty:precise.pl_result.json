  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes model the Monty Hall problem accurately, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes of keeping or switching doors. The generated code introduces minor syntactic changes, such as adding 'select_door(Selected)' in the conditions, but these do not affect the logic or results. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
