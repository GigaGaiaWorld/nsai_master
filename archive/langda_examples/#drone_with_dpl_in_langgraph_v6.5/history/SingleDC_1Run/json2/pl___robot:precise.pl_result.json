  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. The logic and structure of the generated code match the original code, including all rules, probabilistic facts, and queries. The only minor difference is in the variable naming in some rules (e.g., 'CurrentPos' instead of 'Pos1'), which does not affect the semantics or execution. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
