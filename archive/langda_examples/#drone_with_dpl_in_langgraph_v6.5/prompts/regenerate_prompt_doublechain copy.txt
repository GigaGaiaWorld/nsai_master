You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog.  Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_information>
{input}
</Regenerate_information>

<Regenerate_format>
{regenerate_template}
<Regenerate_format>

<Syntax_Notes>
ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's control constructs (logical connectives and meta-predicates) that do not break the logical (declarative) semantics. 
It excludes features like cuts and imperative control that have no meaning in a probabilistic setting.

Supported control predicates:
- Conjunction: P, Q (both P and Q must succeed).
- Disjunction: P; Q (either P or Q succeeds).
- true/0 (always succeeds).
- fail/0 (always fails) and synonym false/0.
- Negation-as-failure: \+/1 (or its alias not/1).
- Meta-call: call/1 (invoke a goal at runtime) and call/N for N up to 9 (for calling predicates with N-1 additional arguments).
- You can also write a goal directly as a term (which is equivalent to call/1).

Supported arithmetic evaluation and comparison: 
- X is Y (evaluate expression Y and unify with X).
- Comparison Operators X < Y, X =< Y (or <=), X > Y, X >= Y, as well as numeric equality X =:= Y and inequality X =\\= Y (which compare numerical values after evaluation).

Not supported control constructs:
- The cut !/0 is not supported (no hard cut in ProbLog; see the Cut library for an alternative soft cut mechanism).
- The if-then (->) and if-then-else (*->) constructs are not supported. (You can achieve a similar effect using (Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative).)

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_information> you will receive the code with issue, its test result and its analysis.
2. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
3. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
4. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>
</Regenerate_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed code here
```
</Final_Answer>

*** split ***
In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

{template_code}

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

{first_chain_output}

<generated_code>
<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}}
```
```problog
{{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}}
```
