I need you to fix some errors in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give you the code with placeholders, content of the code block and corresponding analysis to each code block that need to be regenerated, please generate the code as required.
{context}

<\context>
<ruleset>
### The full rule set with placeholders is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

{rule_set}
</ruleset>
<code_list>
### Here are the code blocks and their analysis:

{requirements}

<code_list>
<requirements>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single prolog block of the following form:

```prolog 
{{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}}
``` 

### This is really important! Also make sure to use the correct syntax. Make sure to address all the issues mentioned in the evaluation and please make sure your code fits completely inside the placeholder!
</requirements>
<example>
### original code with placeholder:
nn(net1, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(1,X,Y).
nn(net2, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(2,X,Y).

outcome(X,X,win).
{{LANGDA}}

game(X,Outcome) :-
    coin(1,X,C1),
    coin(2,X,C2),
    {{LANGDA}}.

### Here are the code blocks and their analysis:
### The 1st Code Block:
outcome(X,Y,loss) :- \+outcome(X,Y,win).

It's corresponding analysis:
Report: correct, it's suitable for the current code
Need_regenerate: False

### The 2nd Code Block:
outcome(C1,C2,game)

It's corresponding analysis:
Report: there's an error, the third item should be "Outcome" instead of "game"
Need_regenerate: True

### Generated Code Blocks: 
```prolog 
{{
    "Hash": "ABCD1234",
    "Code": "outcome(X,Y,loss) :- \+outcome(X,Y,win)."
}}
``` 
```prolog 
{{
    "Hash": "EFGH5678",
    "Code": "outcome(C1,C2,Outcome)"
}}
``` 

### then I could fit the generated code into the placeholder myself:
nn(net1, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(1,X,Y).
nn(net2, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(2,X,Y).

outcome(X,X,win).
outcome(X,Y,loss) :- \+outcome(X,Y,win).

game(X,Outcome) :-
    coin(1,X,C1),
    coin(2,X,C2),
    outcome(C1,C2,Outcome).
