Here's the complete code that replaces the langda term with the definition of `addition_noisy/3`:

```prolog
addition_noisy(X, Y, Z) :-
    digit(X, A),
    digit(Y, B),
    (noisy, uniform(A, B, Z); \+ nois, Z is (A + B) mod 19).
```

This code defines the `addition_noisy/3` predicate which:
1. Gets the digit predictions for inputs X and Y (A and B respectively)
2. Either:
   - With probability 0.1 (when `noisy` is true), selects Z uniformly from 0-18
   - Otherwise (90% chance), computes Z as (A + B) modulo 19

The code maintains all the functionality described in the original rules while avoiding the use of the '->' symbol as requested.
