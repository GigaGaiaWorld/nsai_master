Here's the complete Problog code with the `langda` term replaced by the appropriate Prolog rule for `anysum/2`:

```prolog
nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).

addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,X2), digit(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.

anysum(Bag,R) :- member(X,Bag), digit(X,X2), R is X2.
```

Note that this implementation assumes each element in Bag is a digit image that can be processed by the digit/2 predicate. If you need to sum multiple numbers in the bag, you would need a more complex recursive solution, but the current implementation matches the simple case described in the requirements.
