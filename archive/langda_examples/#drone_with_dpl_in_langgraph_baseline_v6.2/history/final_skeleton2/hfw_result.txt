The generated code is a faithful reproduction of the original code, maintaining all its functionality and structure. The neural network declarations for detecting numbers and operators (net1 and net2) are correctly preserved. The detect_all predicate processes lists of images exactly as in the original, handling both single-element lists and recursive cases. The almost_equal predicate for floating-point comparisons is correctly implemented with both ground and variable cases. The expression predicate still ties the detection and parsing together, and the parse predicate handles all arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction via multiplication by -1, multiplication, and division with zero check) identically to the original. The code follows standard Problog syntax and does not use the '->' symbol as requested. There are no syntax errors or logical inconsistencies between the original and generated code.
