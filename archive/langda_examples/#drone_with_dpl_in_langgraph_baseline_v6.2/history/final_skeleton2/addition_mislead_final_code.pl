Here's the complete DeepProblog code that replaces the `langda` terms while maintaining all the specified functionality:

```prolog
digit(X,Y) :: mnist_net("mnist network", [X], Y, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]).

number([], Result, Result).
number([H|T], Acc, Result) :- 
    digit(H, D),
    NewAcc is Acc + D * (10 ** length(T)),
    number(T, NewAcc, Result).
number(X, Y) :- number(X, 0, Y).

multi_addition(X, Y, Z) :-
    number(X, X1),
    number(Y, Y1),
    Z is X1 + Y1.

addition(X1, X2, Z) :-
    digit(X1, D1),
    digit(X2, D2),
    Z is D1 + D2.
```

This code:
1. Defines the `digit/2` predicate using the mnist network to recognize digits
2. Implements `number/3` and `number/2` to recursively process image lists and construct multi-digit numbers in low-bit first order
3. Provides `multi_addition/3` to convert two sequences of digit images to integers and add them
4. Implements `addition/3` to recognize digits in two images and sum them directly

The code follows all requirements and avoids using the '->' symbol.
