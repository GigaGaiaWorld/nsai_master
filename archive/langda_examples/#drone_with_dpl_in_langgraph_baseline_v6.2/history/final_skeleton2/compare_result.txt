The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. It correctly replaces the `langda` term with appropriate Prolog rules for the single pass traversal process of the bubble algorithm. The first version uses a conditional ('->') to handle the swap result, which is a valid approach in Prolog for implementing conditional logic. The second version provides an alternative implementation without using the '->' symbol, splitting the conditional into two separate clauses that pattern match on the swap result. Both versions are consistent with the original code's intent and maintain the same functionality. The generated code adheres to the structure and logic of the original code while providing a complete implementation for the bubble algorithm.
