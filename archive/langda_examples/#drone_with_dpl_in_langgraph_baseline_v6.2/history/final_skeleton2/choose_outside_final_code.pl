Here's the complete code that replaces the langda term with the implementation of the `add/5` predicate:

```prolog
add([H1|T1],[H2|T2],C,Carry,[Digit|Res]) :-
    slot(H1,H2,C,NewCarry,Digit),
    add(T1,T2,NewCarry,Carry,Res).
```

This implementation:
1. Takes two non-empty lists [H1|T1] and [H2|T2], an input carry C, and produces Carry and [Digit|Res] as outputs
2. Uses the slot/4 predicate to compute the current digit (Digit) and new carry (NewCarry) from the current digits H1, H2 and input carry C
3. Recursively processes the tails of the lists (T1, T2) with the new carry value
4. Builds the result list by prepending the computed Digit to the recursive result Res

The code maintains the original functionality while properly handling the carry propagation through the digit addition process.
