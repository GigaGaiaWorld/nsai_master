Here's the complete DeepProblog code that implements bit-by-bit addition of two numbers, replacing the langda term while maintaining all the functionality from the original ruleset:

```prolog
nn(neural1,[I1,I2,Carry],O,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: result(I1,I2,Carry,O).
nn(neural2,[I1,I2,Carry],NewCarry,[0,1]) :: carry(I1,I2,Carry,NewCarry).

slot(I1,I2,Carry,Carry2,O) :-
    result(I1,I2,Carry,O),
    carry(I1,I2,Carry,Carry2).

add_bits([], [], Carry, [], Carry).
add_bits([I1|I1s], [I2|I2s], Carry, [O|Os], FinalCarry) :-
    slot(I1, I2, Carry, NewCarry, O),
    add_bits(I1s, I2s, NewCarry, Os, FinalCarry).
```

This implementation:
1. Keeps the original neural network declarations for `result/4` and `carry/4`
2. Maintains the `slot/5` predicate that combines the result and carry
3. Adds recursive `add_bits/5` predicate that performs bit-by-bit addition of two numbers represented as lists of bits
4. Handles the base case (empty lists) and recursive case (processing each bit pair)
5. Propagates the carry through each bit addition
6. Returns the final result bits and final carry value
