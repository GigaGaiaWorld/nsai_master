Here's the complete DeepProblog code that implements bit-by-bit addition of two numbers, replacing the langda term with the actual implementation:

```prolog
nn(neural1,[I1,I2,Carry],O,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: result(I1,I2,Carry,O).
nn(neural2,[I1,I2,Carry],NewCarry,[0,1]) :: carry(I1,I2,Carry,NewCarry).

slot(I1,I2,Carry,Carry2,O) :-
    result(I1,I2,Carry,O),
    carry(I1,I2,Carry,Carry2).

add_numbers([], [], Carry, [Carry]).
add_numbers([H1|T1], [H2|T2], Carry, [O|Result]) :-
    slot(H1, H2, Carry, NewCarry, O),
    add_numbers(T1, T2, NewCarry, Result).

% Example query:
% add_numbers([7,4,3], [8,6,5], 0, Output).
% Output should be [5,1,9,0] representing 915
```

This implementation:
1. Keeps the original neural predicate definitions for result and carry
2. Maintains the slot predicate that combines result and carry
3. Adds the recursive add_numbers predicate that:
   - Handles the base case when both lists are empty
   - Processes each digit pair with their current carry
   - Recurses with the new carry
4. The example shows how to add 347 + 568 by representing them as [7,4,3] + [8,6,5] with initial carry 0

The output will be in little-endian format (least significant digit first), with the final carry appended at the end if needed.
