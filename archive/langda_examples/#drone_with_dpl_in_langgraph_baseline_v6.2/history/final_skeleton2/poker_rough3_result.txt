The generated code is mostly valid and correctly replaces the `langda` terms with actual game logic. It maintains the original functionality by using the `cards/4` predicate to get the cards for both players, `best_hand_rank/2` to determine the best hand rank for each player, and `outcome/3` to determine the result based on the ranks. The generated code is consistent with the original code and correctly implements the game logic as required. However, there is a minor issue: the `game/3` predicate in the generated code does not account for the house rank, which was part of the original code's probabilistic setup (via `t(1/4)::house_rank/1`). This omission means the generated code does not fully replicate the original's behavior regarding the house rank. Despite this, the core game logic is correctly implemented and the code is syntactically valid.
