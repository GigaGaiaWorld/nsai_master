The generated code is valid and consistent with the original code. The `langda` term from the original code has been correctly replaced by the actual Prolog predicate definition for `almost_equal/2`. The rest of the code remains unchanged and maintains the same functionality. The generated code correctly defines the neural network predicates `detect_number` and `detect_operator`, the `detect_all` predicate for processing lists of images, and the `expression` and `parse` predicates for evaluating mathematical expressions. The `almost_equal` predicate is correctly defined to handle both ground and unbound variables, ensuring numerical comparisons are accurate within a small epsilon. There are no identified issues in the generated code.
