Based on the requirements, I'll generate the Problog code to replace the `langda` term while maintaining the same functionality (calculating the sum of numbers in a bag). Here's the complete code:

```prolog
nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).

addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,X2), digit(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.

anysum([], 0).
anysum([X|Rest], R) :- digit(X, X2), anysum(Rest, R2), R is X2 + R2.
```

This implementation:
1. Keeps the original `digit` and `addition` predicates unchanged
2. Replaces the `langda` term with a recursive Prolog-style predicate `anysum/2` that:
   - Has a base case for empty list (sum is 0)
   - Recursively processes each element in the list, converts it to a digit, and sums them up
3. Maintains the same interface where `anysum(Bag, R)` calculates the sum R of numbers in Bag
