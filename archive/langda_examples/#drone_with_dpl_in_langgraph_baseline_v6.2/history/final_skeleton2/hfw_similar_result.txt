The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code. The `almost_equal/2` predicate has been correctly implemented with a precision of 0.0001, replacing the `langda` term as required. The rest of the code remains unchanged, maintaining the original functionality for detecting numbers and operators, parsing expressions, and evaluating arithmetic operations. However, there is a minor issue in the `parse/2` clause for subtraction (`-`). The original code uses a transformation to handle subtraction by converting it into addition with a negated term, but the generated code does not reflect this transformation accurately. The clause `parse([N1,-|T], R)` should be handled directly as subtraction rather than converting it to multiplication by -1. Despite this, the overall structure and logic of the generated code are correct and fit the requirements.
