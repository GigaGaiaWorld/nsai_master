The generated code is a valid implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in DeepProbLog. It correctly replaces the placeholder `langda` terms with proper Prolog predicates that implement the bubble sort logic. The `bubble/3` predicate now correctly handles a single pass through the list, utilizing the `swap` and `hole` predicates to compare and potentially swap adjacent elements. The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively applies the `bubble/3` predicate to sort the entire list. The implementation is consistent with the original code's structure and maintains the use of the neural predicate `swap` for decision making. No issues are identified in the generated code; it correctly implements the bubble sort algorithm as required.
