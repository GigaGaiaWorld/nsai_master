==============choose_inside_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and correctly implements the ripple-carry addition logic as intended. It replaces the `langda` term with a proper recursive definition of the `add/5` predicate, which is consistent with the original code's structure and requirements. The `add/5` predicate correctly uses the `slot/5` predicate to compute the resulting digit and new carry for each pair of digits from the input lists, then recursively processes the rest of the lists. This maintains the original code's functionality and style. However, there is a minor issue with the `add/4` predicate (the last clause in the generated code). The clause `add(L1,L2,C,[Carry|Res]) :- add(L1,L2,C,Carry,Res).` is syntactically correct but might lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully, as it wraps the final carry in a list. This could be intentional for some use cases, but without additional context, it's hard to determine if this is the desired behavior. Overall, the generated code is valid and fits the requirements, with only a minor potential issue in the `add/4` predicate.

==============choose_outside_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code's intent, but there are a few issues to note. The generated `add/5` predicate correctly implements the logic for adding two lists of digits with carry propagation, using the `slot/4` predicate to compute individual digit sums and carry values. It maintains the recursive structure needed for processing multi-digit numbers. However, there are two problems: 1) The head of the generated predicate shows `Carry` as an output parameter, but in the recursive call it's used as a list `[Carry|Res]`, which is inconsistent with its use in the base case where `C` (the final carry) is not wrapped in a list. 2) The original code shows a base case `add([],[],C,C,[])` which expects the final carry as the fourth argument, but the generated recursive case seems to expect it as part of the result list. This inconsistency in handling the final carry makes the generated code not fully valid as it stands.

==============choose_simple_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and maintains the functionality of the original code. It correctly replaces the `langda` term with direct calls to the neural predicates `result/4` and `carry/4`. The `slot/5` predicate in the generated code combines these two operations to perform a single digit addition with carry propagation, just as the original code intended. The structure and logic of the `add/5` and `add/4` predicates remain unchanged, ensuring consistency with the original code. There are no identified issues in the generated code.

==============simple_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and improved version of the original code. It correctly replaces the langda terms with proper DeepProbLog syntax while maintaining all the original functionality. The analysis is as follows:

1. **Correctness**: The generated code correctly defines the `digit/2` predicate using the mnist_net neural network with 10 possible output digits (0-9). It also correctly implements the `addition/3` predicate by first recognizing digits from images X and Y and then calculating their sum.

2. **Consistency with the original code**: The generated code maintains all the original requirements. It replaces the natural language specifications in the original code with proper DeepProbLog syntax, making it more consistent with standard Prolog and DeepProbLog practices.

3. **Improvements**: The generated code is more concise and eliminates the unnecessary `langda` terms from the original code. It also avoids using the '->' symbol, which was not present in the original code but was mentioned in the requirements.

4. **Identified Issues**: There are no identified issues in the generated code. It is syntactically correct and logically sound.

==============any_sum_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid replacement for the original code. It maintains the same functionality while adhering to proper Prolog syntax and semantics. The analysis is as follows:

1. **Correctness**: 
   - The `digit` and `addition` predicates are preserved exactly as in the original.
   - The new `anysum/2` implementation correctly calculates the sum of numbers in a bag (list) by:
     - Properly handling the base case (empty list returns sum 0)
     - Recursively processing each element and summing them
     - Using the `digit/2` predicate to convert input elements to numbers

2. **Consistency with Original**:
   - The interface remains identical (`anysum(Bag, R)`)
   - The functionality matches the original's intent to calculate sums
   - Replaces the non-standard `langda` term with proper Prolog code

3. **Improvements**:
   - More transparent implementation than the original's LLM reference
   - Better follows Prolog conventions for list processing
   - More maintainable and debuggable

4. **Potential Considerations**:
   - The original's `langda` might have had additional unspecified functionality
   - The new version assumes input is properly formatted as a list
   - No error handling for non-digit elements (same as original)

No actual issues were identified in the generated code.

==============poker_rough3_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and correctly replaces the `langda` terms with actual game logic. It maintains the original functionality by using the `cards/4` predicate to get the cards for both players, `best_hand_rank/2` to determine the best hand rank for each player, and `outcome/3` to determine the result based on the ranks. The generated code is consistent with the original code and correctly implements the game logic as required. However, there is a minor issue: the `game/3` predicate in the generated code does not account for the house rank, which was part of the original code's probabilistic setup (via `t(1/4)::house_rank/1`). This omission means the generated code does not fully replicate the original's behavior regarding the house rank. Despite this, the core game logic is correctly implemented and the code is syntactically valid.

==============hfw_fine1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. It correctly replaces the `langda` term with an implementation of `almost_equal/2` that matches the specified behavior. The first version uses the '->' symbol for conditional logic, which is a natural and efficient way to implement the predicate in Prolog. The alternative version, provided as a note, avoids the '->' symbol by using separate clauses, which is also correct and adheres to the requirement of not using the '->' symbol. Both versions maintain consistency with the original code's functionality and requirements. The rest of the code remains unchanged and correctly implements the expression parsing logic.

==============choose_example_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and correctly implements bit-by-bit addition of two numbers as specified in the requirements. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The neural network predicates `result/4` and `carry/4` are correctly maintained from the original code.
   - The `slot/5` predicate is correctly defined to combine the results from both neural networks.
   - The new `add_numbers/4` predicate correctly implements the recursive addition process:
     - Base case handles empty lists and appends the final carry
     - Recursive case processes each digit pair with current carry
     - Correctly passes the new carry to the next recursion

2. **Consistency with Original Code**:
   - The generated code preserves all the original functionality
   - It properly replaces the langda term with actual implementation
   - The neural network interface remains unchanged

3. **Minor Issues**:
   - The example comment shows output as [5,1,9,0] but the requirement mentions [0,9,1,5]. This is just a documentation inconsistency.
   - The code doesn't handle cases where input lists have different lengths (though this wasn't a requirement)

4. **Requirements Fulfillment**:
   - The code correctly implements little-endian addition as specified
   - Handles carry propagation properly
   - Produces the correct output format with final carry

The generated code is valid and meets all specified requirements. The minor documentation inconsistency doesn't affect the actual functionality.

==============addition_mislead_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and correct implementation of the original requirements. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Digit Recognition**: 
   - The `digit(X,Y)` predicate is correctly defined using the mnist network, matching the original specification.
   - The output range [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] is implicitly handled by the neural network.

2. **Number Construction**:
   - The `number/3` and `number/2` predicates correctly implement recursive processing of image lists.
   - It constructs multi-digit numbers in low-bit first order as specified, using `10 ** length(T)` for proper digit positioning.
   - The base case and accumulator handling are correctly implemented.

3. **Addition Operations**:
   - `multi_addition/3` correctly converts image sequences to numbers and adds them.
   - `addition/3` correctly handles single-digit addition from two images.
   - Both match the original requirements of using the mnist network for digit recognition.

4. **Consistency with Original**:
   - All `langda` terms have been properly replaced with concrete implementations.
   - The functionality described in the original comments is fully preserved.
   - The code avoids using the '->' symbol as requested.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The arithmetic operations are correctly implemented.
   - The recursive logic in `number/3` is sound and will terminate properly.
   - All predicates have the correct arity and parameter handling.

The only minor deviation is that the generated code doesn't explicitly mention the network name ('mnist network') in the comments, but this is not required for functionality.

==============choose_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and fits the requirements for implementing bit-by-bit addition of two numbers. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The generated code correctly maintains the original neural network declarations (`result/4` and `carry/4`) and the `slot/5` predicate.
   - The new `add_bits/5` predicate is correctly implemented to perform recursive bit-by-bit addition, handling both base and recursive cases appropriately.
   - The carry propagation is correctly implemented through each bit addition.

2. **Consistency with Original Code**:
   - The generated code preserves all the functionality from the original ruleset.
   - It properly replaces the `langda` term while maintaining the original intent of bit-by-bit addition.
   - The neural network declarations and their usage remain unchanged.

3. **Improvements**:
   - The generated code actually improves upon the original by providing a concrete implementation of the bit-by-bit addition process.
   - It adds the recursive list processing that was only hinted at in the original code.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code assumes input lists are of equal length (no handling for different-length inputs).
   - There's no input validation or type checking, though this is typical for Prolog code.
   - The neural network output ranges (0-9 for result, 0-1 for carry) might need verification for actual use cases.

5. **Requirements Fulfillment**:
   - The code fully meets the requirement of implementing bit-by-bit addition while maintaining original functionality.
   - It properly structures the solution as a recursive list processing operation.

Overall, the generated code is a valid and correct implementation that improves upon the original while maintaining all required functionality.

==============compare_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. It correctly replaces the `langda` term with appropriate Prolog rules for the single pass traversal process of the bubble algorithm. The first version uses a conditional ('->') to handle the swap result, which is a valid approach in Prolog for implementing conditional logic. The second version provides an alternative implementation without using the '->' symbol, splitting the conditional into two separate clauses that pattern match on the swap result. Both versions are consistent with the original code's intent and maintain the same functionality. The generated code adheres to the structure and logic of the original code while providing a complete implementation for the bubble algorithm.

==============noisy_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code attempts to define the `addition_noisy/3` predicate as specified, but there are several issues that make it invalid or inconsistent with the original code. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Syntax Error**: The generated code uses `\\+ nois` which is incorrect. It should be `\\+ noisy` to properly negate the `noisy` predicate.

2. **Probability Handling**: The original code specifies a probabilistic choice between uniform selection and addition with `t(0.1) :: noisy`, but the generated code doesn't properly reflect this probabilistic nature in its structure. The `;` operator in Prolog doesn't inherently handle probabilities - this should be handled by the probabilistic framework of DeepProbLog.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While the modulo operation is correctly specified as `mod 19`, the context suggests this should be tied to the uniform distribution's range (0-18), which it does correctly.

4. **Consistency with Original**: The generated code doesn't maintain the exact probabilistic semantics of the original. In DeepProbLog, probabilistic choices should be explicitly declared using the probabilistic predicates, not handled through Prolog's disjunction.

5. **Missing Probabilistic Context**: The original code uses DeepProbLog's probabilistic constructs (like `t(0.1) :: noisy`), but the generated code treats this as a regular Prolog predicate without the probabilistic framework.

6. **Variable Scope**: The variables A and B are correctly scoped within the predicate, and the digit/2 predicate is properly used to get the classifications.

==============noisy_static_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code's intent. The `langda` term from the original code, which was a natural language description of the uniform distribution, has been correctly replaced with a `discrete/2` distribution in the generated code. This ensures that the `uniform(X,Y,V)` predicate assigns equal probability (1/19) to each integer value from 0 to 18, as specified. The rest of the code, including the neural network predicate `digit(X,Y)`, the probabilistic fact `noisy`, and the rules for `addition_noisy` and `addition`, remains unchanged and correctly implemented. However, the generated code does not account for the variables `X` and `Y` in the `uniform(X,Y,V)` predicate, which are not used in the distribution definition. This could be seen as a minor inconsistency, though it does not affect the functionality.

==============promis_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code makes several changes to the original code, some of which are valid while others introduce issues. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Replacement of `langda` terms**: The generated code replaces the `langda(LLM:\

==============poker_rough1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and correct implementation to replace the `langda(\

==============quicksort_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and correct implementation of the quicksort algorithm in DeepProbLog. It successfully replaces the `langda` term with the supplementary logic for quicksort, maintaining consistency with the original code's structure and intent. The generated code correctly implements the quicksort algorithm by partitioning the list around a pivot, recursively sorting the partitions, and then combining them. The `swap` predicate, defined via a neural network (`swap_net`), is used within the `partition` predicate to decide the placement of elements relative to the pivot. The `append` predicate is correctly defined for list concatenation. The `forth_sort` predicate remains unchanged, simply acting as an alias for `quicksort`. The code adheres to Prolog syntax and DeepProbLog extensions, with no apparent issues or inconsistencies.

==============hfw_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a faithful reproduction of the original code, maintaining all its functionality and structure. The neural network declarations for detecting numbers and operators (net1 and net2) are correctly preserved. The detect_all predicate processes lists of images exactly as in the original, handling both single-element lists and recursive cases. The almost_equal predicate for floating-point comparisons is correctly implemented with both ground and variable cases. The expression predicate still ties the detection and parsing together, and the parse predicate handles all arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction via multiplication by -1, multiplication, and division with zero check) identically to the original. The code follows standard Problog syntax and does not use the '->' symbol as requested. There are no syntax errors or logical inconsistencies between the original and generated code.

==============any_sum_result.txt:==============
The generated code is not entirely valid for the intended purpose. While it correctly replaces the `langda` term with a Prolog rule for `anysum/2`, the implementation does not fully meet the requirements. The original intention was to calculate the sum of all numbers in the Bag, but the generated code only sums the first element encountered by `member(X,Bag)`. This is because the rule does not recursively or iteratively process all elements in the Bag. A correct implementation should aggregate all elements in the Bag, either through recursion or using built-in predicates like `sum_list/2` if available. Additionally, the generated code assumes each element in Bag is a digit image, which might not be the case if Bag is intended to be a list of numbers directly.

==============wap_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and follows the requirements specified in the original code. It correctly utilizes all the neural networks (net1, net2, net3, net4) and the associated predicates (permute, swap, operator) to implement the logic of 'adding the smallest two numbers and then subtracting the largest'. The code structure is consistent with the original ruleset and correctly processes the input through each step. However, there are a few minor issues: 1) The min/2 and max/2 predicates are used but not defined in the original code, which could lead to runtime errors. 2) The variable 'LLM' from the original langda term is not utilized in the generated code, though this doesn't affect functionality. 3) The logic for finding the two smallest numbers could be simplified by directly selecting the two smallest from the three numbers rather than the current approach of comparing pairs.

==============poker_rough2_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly replaces the 'langda' terms with the actual supplementary logic, maintaining the functionality of the original code. The generated code includes all the necessary predicates and maintains the same probabilistic and neural network declarations as the original. However, there is a minor issue noted in the report about typos (e.g., 'straight' vs 'straight') which were preserved but do not affect the validity of the code. The generated code correctly implements the game logic, hand rankings, and outcome determinations as specified in the original code. The structure and logic flow are preserved, making the generated code a valid replacement for the original.

==============promis_fine_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and aligns well with the original code's intent, but there are a few points to consider:

1. **Correctness**: The generated code correctly replaces the `langda` terms with explicit Problog rules. The bomb safety constraint is accurately translated into a `mission_allowed(X)` rule, and the mission conditions are explicitly defined in the `landscape` predicate.

2. **Consistency**: The generated code maintains all the original rules and properties, such as UAV properties, weather conditions, visual line of sight, and permits. The logic for `vlos(X)`, `can_return(X)`, and `permits(X)` remains unchanged.

3. **Issues**: 
   - The original `langda` term for the bomb safety constraint included a message (`LLM:\

==============quicksort_superrough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid but has some issues that need to be addressed. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Neural Predicate Consistency**: The neural predicate `nn(swap_net, [X,Y], Z, [no_swap, swap]) :: swap(X,Y,Z).` is correctly maintained from the original code, which is good.

2. **Quicksort Implementation**: The quicksort implementation is logically correct and follows standard Prolog syntax. It includes the base case and recursive case for `quick_sort/2`, and the `partition/4` predicate to split the list.

3. **Use of '->' Symbol**: The generated code uses the '->' symbol in the `partition/4` predicate, which is not present in the original code. While this is syntactically correct in Prolog, it might not align with the requirement to avoid using '->' if that was implied by the original code's style.

4. **Prompt Requirement**: The prompt 'Achieve quick sort' is not explicitly included in the generated code, which might be a requirement depending on the context.

5. **Missing Swap Integration**: The generated code does not integrate the `swap/3` predicate into the quicksort logic, which might be expected if the neural network's swap functionality was meant to be part of the sorting process.

6. **Overall Validity**: The code is syntactically correct and implements quicksort as requested, but it does not fully integrate the neural predicate and uses a control structure ('->') that might not be desired.

==============addition_normal_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and aligns well with the original requirements, but there are some issues to note. The `digit` predicate is correctly defined to use the `mnist_net` neural network for digit classification. The `number` predicate is implemented to recursively process a list of digit images and construct a multi-digit number, though the original code suggested low-bit first order, which is not explicitly handled in the generated code. The `multi_addition` and `addition` predicates correctly convert sequences of digit images into numbers and perform addition. However, the original code hinted at using a neural network for these operations, which is not reflected in the generated code. Overall, the generated code is functionally correct but lacks some of the neural network integration suggested in the original code.

==============hfw_similar_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code. The `almost_equal/2` predicate has been correctly implemented with a precision of 0.0001, replacing the `langda` term as required. The rest of the code remains unchanged, maintaining the original functionality for detecting numbers and operators, parsing expressions, and evaluating arithmetic operations. However, there is a minor issue in the `parse/2` clause for subtraction (`-`). The original code uses a transformation to handle subtraction by converting it into addition with a negated term, but the generated code does not reflect this transformation accurately. The clause `parse([N1,-|T], R)` should be handled directly as subtraction rather than converting it to multiplication by -1. Despite this, the overall structure and logic of the generated code are correct and fit the requirements.

==============compare_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in DeepProbLog. It correctly replaces the placeholder `langda` terms with proper Prolog predicates that implement the bubble sort logic. The `bubble/3` predicate now correctly handles a single pass through the list, utilizing the `swap` and `hole` predicates to compare and potentially swap adjacent elements. The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively applies the `bubble/3` predicate to sort the entire list. The implementation is consistent with the original code's structure and maintains the use of the neural predicate `swap` for decision making. No issues are identified in the generated code; it correctly implements the bubble sort algorithm as required.

==============hfw_rough1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and maintains the functionality described in the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The neural network declarations (`nn/4`) for `detect_number` and `detect_operator` are preserved correctly.
   - The `detect_all/2` predicate is unchanged and correctly processes lists of images into symbols.
   - The `almost_equal/2` predicate remains the same, handling floating-point comparisons.
   - The `expression/2` predicate still serves as the main interface, connecting symbol detection with parsing.
   - The new `parse/2` and `evaluate/4` predicates correctly implement the arithmetic expression evaluation described in the `langda` term.

2. **Consistency with Original Code**:
   - The generated code replaces the `langda` term with explicit parsing and evaluation rules, which aligns with the described functionality.
   - The interface (`expression/2`) remains consistent, ensuring backward compatibility.

3. **Identified Issues**:
   - The original code mentions a `parse/2` predicate but doesn't define it, while the generated code provides its implementation. This is actually an improvement.
   - The generated code assumes that the input symbols are already numbers and operators, but the original code's `detect_number` and `detect_operator` might output atoms (e.g., '+') rather than evaluable terms. This could cause issues in `evaluate/4` if the symbols are not properly converted.
   - There's no error handling for division by zero or invalid operations.

4. **Additional Notes**:
   - The generated code successfully implements step-by-step calculation of mathematical expressions as required.
   - It handles all four basic arithmetic operations and processes expressions recursively.
   - The absence of the '->' symbol is correctly noted, as per requirements.

Overall, the generated code is valid and fits the requirements, though it could benefit from additional checks for symbol conversion and error handling.

==============hfw_base_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and consistent with the original code. The `langda` term from the original code has been correctly replaced by the actual Prolog predicate definition for `almost_equal/2`. The rest of the code remains unchanged and maintains the same functionality. The generated code correctly defines the neural network predicates `detect_number` and `detect_operator`, the `detect_all` predicate for processing lists of images, and the `expression` and `parse` predicates for evaluating mathematical expressions. The `almost_equal` predicate is correctly defined to handle both ground and unbound variables, ensuring numerical comparisons are accurate within a small epsilon. There are no identified issues in the generated code.
