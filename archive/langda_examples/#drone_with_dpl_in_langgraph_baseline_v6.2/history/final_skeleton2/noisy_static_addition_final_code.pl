Here's the complete Problog code with the `langda` term replaced by the appropriate uniform distribution definition:

```prolog
nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).

t(0.1) :: noisy.

uniform(X,Y,V) : discrete(V,[0:1/19,1:1/19,2:1/19,3:1/19,4:1/19,5:1/19,6:1/19,7:1/19,8:1/19,9:1/19,10:1/19,11:1/19,12:1/19,13:1/19,14:1/19,15:1/19,16:1/19,17:1/19,18:1/19]).

addition_noisy(X,Y,Z) :- noisy, uniform(X,Y,Z).
addition_noisy(X,Y,Z) :- \+noisy, digit(X,N1), digit(Y,N2), Z is N1+N2.

addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,N1), digit(Y,N2), Z is N1+N2.
```

The `uniform(X,Y,V)` predicate is defined using the `discrete/2` distribution to assign equal probability (1/19) to each integer value from 0 to 18, exactly as specified in the natural language description.
