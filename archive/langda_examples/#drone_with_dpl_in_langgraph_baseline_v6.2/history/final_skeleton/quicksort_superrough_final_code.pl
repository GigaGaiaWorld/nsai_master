Here's the complete DeepProbLog code based on your requirements:

```prolog
% Neural network declaration for swap operation
nn(swap_net, [X, Y], Z, [no_swap, swap]) :: swap(X, Y, Z).

% LLM prompt for quick sort
prompt(LLM:"Achieve quick sort").
```

This code includes:
1. A neural predicate `swap_net` that takes two inputs (X and Y) and outputs Z with two possible actions: 'no_swap' or 'swap'
2. A prompt directive for the LLM to achieve quick sort functionality

The code avoids using the '->' symbol as requested in your annotations.
