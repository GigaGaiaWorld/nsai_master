Here's the complete DeepProblog code based on the provided ruleset:

```prolog
% UAV properties
initial_charge ~ normal(90, 5).
charge_cost ~ normal(-0.1, 0.2).
weight ~ normal(0.2, 0.1).

% Weather conditions
1/10::fog; 9/10::clear.

% Langda predicate for bomb warning
langda(LLM:"we found a bomb on the map, please stay 100 meters away from it", FUP:"F").

% Visual line of sight definition
vlos(X) :- 
    fog, distance(X, operator) < 50.
vlos(X) :- 
    clear, distance(X, operator) < 100.
vlos(X) :- 
    clear, over(X, bay), distance(X, operator) < 400.

% Sufficient charge to return to operator
can_return(X) :-
    B is initial_charge, 
    O is charge_cost,
    D is distance(X, operator), 
    0 < B + (2 * O * D).

% Definition of a valid mission
landscape(X) :- 
    langda(LLM:"If the drone meets one of the following conditions, the mission will be allowed to be carried out: 
        1.visual route range + light weight + returnable
        2.permission obtained + returnable
        # Additionally, it should not violate the requirements of other langda predicates.
    ", FUP:"T").

% Mission validity conditions
valid_mission(X) :-
    vlos(X),
    weight < 0.3,
    can_return(X),
    not(langda(_, "F")).

valid_mission(X) :-
    permits(X),
    can_return(X),
    not(langda(_, "F")).

% Permits related to local features
permits(X) :- 
    distance(X, service) < 15.
permits(X) :- 
    distance(X, primary) < 15.
permits(X) :- 
    distance(X, secondary) < 10.
permits(X) :- 
    distance(X, tertiary) < 5.
permits(X) :- 
    distance(X, crossing) < 5.
permits(X) :- 
    distance(X, rail) < 5.
permits(X) :- 
    over(X, park).
```

Key points about this implementation:
1. I've separated the disjunctive conditions in `vlos/1` and `permits/1` into multiple clauses for clarity
2. Added a `valid_mission/1` predicate that implements the two conditions mentioned in the landscape description
3. Ensured the bomb warning langda predicate is checked in both mission validity conditions
4. Maintained all the original probability distributions and numerical relationships
5. Kept all the original natural language annotations in the langda predicates
6. Avoided using the '->' symbol as requested

The code captures all the requirements from the original ruleset while maintaining proper Prolog syntax.
