Here's the complete DeepProblog code based on the provided ruleset and requirements:

```prolog
% Neural network declarations
nn(neural1, [I1, I2, Carry], O, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: result(I1, I2, Carry, O).
nn(neural2, [I1, I2, Carry], NewCarry, [0,1]) :: carry(I1, I2, Carry, NewCarry).

% Addition slot combining both result and carry
slot(I1, I2, Carry, Carry2, O) :-
    result(I1, I2, Carry, O),
    carry(I1, I2, Carry, Carry2).

% Commented out alternative implementations
% nn(neural1, [I], O, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: result(I, O).
% nn(neural2, [I], NewCarry, [0,1]) :: carry(I, NewCarry).

% Commented out one-hot encoding version
% slot(I1, I2, Carry, Carry2, O) :-
%    one_hot(I1, 10, T1),
%    one_hot(I2, 10, T2),
%    one_hot(Carry, 2, T3),
%    cat([T1, T2, T3], T),
%    result(T, O),
%    carry(T, Carry2).

% Description of the program's purpose
langda("Implement bit-by-bit addition of two numbers").
```

This code includes:
1. The two neural network declarations (neural1 for result and neural2 for carry)
2. The main slot predicate that combines both neural networks
3. The commented-out alternative implementations
4. The langda description of the program's purpose

The code follows all the requirements and avoids using the '->' symbol. It maintains all the functionality from the original ruleset while being properly formatted for DeepProblog.
