Here's the complete DeepProbLog code based on the provided ruleset and requirements:

```prolog
% Neural network declarations
nn(neural1, [I1, I2, Carry], O, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: result(I1, I2, Carry, O).
nn(neural2, [I1, I2, Carry], NewCarry, [0,1]) :: carry(I1, I2, Carry, NewCarry).

% Slot predicate combining result and carry
slot(I1, I2, Carry, Carry2, O) :-
    result(I1, I2, Carry, O),
    carry(I1, I2, Carry, Carry2).

% Base case for addition
add([], [], C, C, []).

% Recursive case for addition
add([H1|T1], [H2|T2], C, Carry, [Digit|Res]) :-
    slot(H1, H2, C, NewCarry, Digit),
    add(T1, T2, NewCarry, Carry, Res).

% Wrapper predicate for addition
add(L1, L2, C, [Carry|Res]) :- 
    add(L1, L2, C, Carry, Res).
```

Key points about this implementation:
1. The neural network declarations (`neural1` and `neural2`) remain unchanged from the original
2. The `slot/5` predicate combines the results from both neural networks
3. The `add/5` predicate handles the recursive digit-by-digit addition:
   - Base case handles empty lists
   - Recursive case uses `slot/5` to get current digit and carry, then recurses
4. The wrapper `add/4` predicate provides the interface for the addition operation
5. All original functionality is preserved without using the '->' symbol

The code implements a digit-by-digit addition with carry propagation, where each digit addition is handled by neural networks that predict both the result digit and the new carry value.
