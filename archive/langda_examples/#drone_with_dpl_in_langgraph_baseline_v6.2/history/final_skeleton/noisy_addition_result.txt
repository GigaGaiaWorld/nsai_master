The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of structure and content. Both codes include the neural network predicate for digit classification, the probabilistic fact for noise, and the uniform distribution over 19 possible values. The generated code also correctly avoids using the '->' symbol as specified. However, there are a few points to consider: 1) The generated code separates each uniform distribution statement into individual lines, which is syntactically correct but differs slightly from the original's semicolon-separated format. This does not affect functionality. 2) The lambda expression 'langda(LLM:\
