The generated code is a faithful reproduction of the original code with improved formatting and comments. It maintains all the key components and logic of the original while being more readable. The analysis reveals:

1. **Neural Network Declarations**: Perfectly matches the original with identical network names, input/output formats, and possible output values.

2. **detect_all/2 Predicate**: Exactly replicates the original's recursive structure for processing lists of images into symbols.

3. **almost_equal/2 Predicate**: Maintains the original's dual functionality for both ground and unbound variables with the same comparison tolerance.

4. **expression/2 Predicate**: Correctly combines symbol detection and parsing as in the original.

5. **parse/2 Predicate**: All cases (single number, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are implemented identically to the original, including:
   - The clever subtraction implementation using multiplication by -1
   - Division by zero protection
   - Proper recursive parsing
   - Floating point result handling

6. **Style Improvements**: The generated code adds helpful comments and better formatting while preserving all functionality.

7. **Requirements Compliance**: The code doesn't use the '->' symbol as requested and implements all specified operations.

The generated code is not only valid but also improves upon the original's readability without altering its behavior.
