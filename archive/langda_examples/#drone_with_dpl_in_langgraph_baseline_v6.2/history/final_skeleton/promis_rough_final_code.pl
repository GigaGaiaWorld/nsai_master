Here's the complete DeepProblog code based on the provided ruleset:

```prolog
% UAV properties
initial_charge ~ normal(90, 5).
charge_cost ~ normal(-0.1, 0.2).
weight ~ normal(0.2, 0.1).

% Weather conditions
1/10::fog; 9/10::clear.

% Language model directive
langda(LLM:"stay away from the bomb", FUP:"F").

% Visual line of sight rules
vlos(X) :- 
    fog, distance(X, operator) < 50.
vlos(X) :- 
    clear, distance(X, operator) < 100.
vlos(X) :- 
    clear, over(X, bay), distance(X, operator) < 400.

% Sufficient charge to return to operator
can_return(X) :-
    B is initial_charge, 
    O is charge_cost,
    D is distance(X, operator), 
    0 < B + (2 * O * D).

% Permits related to local features
permits(X) :- distance(X, service) < 15.
permits(X) :- distance(X, primary) < 15.
permits(X) :- distance(X, secondary) < 10.
permits(X) :- distance(X, tertiary) < 5.
permits(X) :- distance(X, crossing) < 5.
permits(X) :- distance(X, rail) < 5.
permits(X) :- over(X, park).

% Definition of a valid mission
landscape(X) :- 
    langda(LLM:"").
```

Key features implemented:
1. UAV properties with normal distributions
2. Weather conditions with probabilities
3. Language model directive
4. Visual line of sight rules with different conditions for fog/clear weather
5. Charge calculation for return capability
6. Multiple permit conditions based on distance to various features
7. Landscape definition tied to language model

The code follows standard Prolog syntax and avoids the '->' symbol as requested. Each rule is clearly separated for readability.
