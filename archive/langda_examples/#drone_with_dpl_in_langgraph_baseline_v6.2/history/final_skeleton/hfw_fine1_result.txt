The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the neural network predicates `detect_number` and `detect_operator` as specified. The `detect_all` predicate is also correctly implemented to process lists of images into symbols. The `almost_equal/2` predicate is accurately defined to handle both cases where Y is ground and where it is a variable, fulfilling the requirements. The parsing rules for arithmetic expressions (`parse/2`) are correctly implemented, including handling for addition, subtraction (converted to addition with negative), multiplication, and division (with a check for division by zero). The operator precedence is handled correctly by processing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. The only minor issue is that the subtraction case in the original code uses `parse([-1,*|T], R2)`, which might be less intuitive but is correctly replicated in the generated code. Overall, the generated code meets all requirements and is valid.
