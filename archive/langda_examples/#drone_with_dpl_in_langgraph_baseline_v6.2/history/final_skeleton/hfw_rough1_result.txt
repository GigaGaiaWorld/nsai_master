The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. The original code did not include the 'parse' and 'compute' predicates, which are added in the generated code. While these additions provide functionality for evaluating mathematical expressions, they were not part of the original specification. The generated code maintains the neural network declarations, helper predicates, and documentation predicates from the original code. The structure and logic of the code are sound, and it avoids using the '->' symbol as requested. However, the addition of the 'parse' and 'compute' predicates, while useful, deviates from the original code's specification.
