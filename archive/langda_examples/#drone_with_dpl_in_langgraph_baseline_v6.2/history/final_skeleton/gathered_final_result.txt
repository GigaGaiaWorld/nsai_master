==============choose_inside_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code's intent. It correctly implements the digit-by-digit addition with carry propagation using neural networks. The key aspects of the analysis are:

1. **Neural Network Declarations**: The generated code preserves the original neural network declarations exactly, maintaining the same input/output structures and value domains.

2. **Slot Predicate**: The implementation of the slot/5 predicate is correct and identical to the original, properly combining the results from both neural networks.

3. **Addition Predicates**: 
   - The base case for add/5 is correctly implemented to handle empty lists.
   - The recursive case properly uses slot/5 to get the current digit and new carry, then recurses.
   - The wrapper add/4 predicate provides the correct interface for the addition operation.

4. **Consistency**: The generated code maintains all the original functionality without introducing any new constructs or changing the logical flow.

5. **Completeness**: The code properly implements the addition logic that was only hinted at in the original code's commented section (langda(LLM:\

==============choose_outside_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. First, the generated code correctly maintains the neural network declarations for `result/4` and `carry/4` and the `slot/5` predicate combines these as intended. The `add/5` predicate is implemented with a base case and a recursive case, which processes each digit pair and uses the `slot/5` predicate to compute the digit sum and carry. However, the wrapper predicate `add/4` is problematic. The original code suggests that `add/4` should have the form `add(L1,L2,C,[Carry|Res])`, but the generated code's wrapper predicate does not match the intended functionality. The wrapper should likely be `add(L1,L2,C,Res)` or similar, as the current form may lead to incorrect list structures. Despite this, the core logic for addition is correctly implemented and follows DeepProblog syntax.

==============choose_simple_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code's functionality, but there are some important differences and potential issues to note:

1. Correctness:
- The neural network declarations are correctly preserved from the original
- The `slot` predicate implementation differs significantly - the generated version directly calls `result` and `carry` predicates, while the original used a `langda` construct with neural network references
- The `add` predicates are correctly implemented and match the original's recursive structure

2. Consistency:
- The generated code removes the commented alternative versions (which is fine)
- The generated code doesn't use the `langda` construct from the original, which might be significant depending on the intended functionality
- The one-hot encoding and tensor operations from the original's commented section are omitted (which is appropriate since they were commented out)

3. Issues:
- The main validity concern is the replacement of the `langda` construct with direct predicate calls. If `langda` was serving a special purpose (like neural network integration or custom operations), this change could affect functionality
- The generated code assumes the neural networks can be called directly, which might not match the original's intended architecture

While the generated code is syntactically correct and logically structured, its semantic validity depends on whether the `langda` construct was essential to the original implementation. Without knowing the exact purpose of `langda`, we can't be certain this is a fully valid replacement.

==============simple_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. First, the original code uses 'lann' for the neural network declaration, while the generated code uses 'nn'. Although 'nn' is a valid DeepProbLog predicate, it does not match the original code's 'lann'. Second, the generated code correctly implements the addition rule by first recognizing the digits in the input images and then calculating their sum, which aligns with the original intention. The 'langda' predicate is correctly declared and used in both the original and generated code. The generated code avoids using the '->' symbol as requested. Overall, the generated code is functionally correct and meets the requirements, but it does not perfectly match the original code's syntax.

==============any_sum_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of structure and functionality. It correctly maintains the neural network predicate `digit(X, Y)` for digit recognition and the `addition(X, Y, Z)` rule for summing recognized digits. However, there are a few issues to note:

1. The `anysum(Bag, R)` rule in the generated code does not utilize the `Bag` parameter, which appears to be a placeholder for input data. This makes the rule incomplete and potentially non-functional as it stands.

2. The `langda(LLM:\

==============poker_rough3_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and maintains the core functionality of the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The probabilistic facts for house_rank are correctly separated into individual statements (though this is syntactically equivalent to the original's semicolon-separated version).
   - The neural network declaration for rank prediction is correctly preserved.
   - All hand definitions (straight, threeofakind, pair, high) are correctly replicated.
   - The hand ranking system and best hand determination logic are perfectly preserved.
   - The outcome determination rules are correctly implemented.

2. **Improvements**:
   - The generated code properly implements the `game/3` predicate that was only a placeholder in the original code. This implementation follows logically from the rest of the codebase.
   - The code is more readable with consistent spacing and formatting.

3. **Consistency**:
   - The generated code maintains all the original functionality while making it more complete by implementing the game logic.
   - All predicates and their behaviors remain consistent with the original.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - None significant. The implementation of `game/3` is reasonable though we can't verify if it exactly matches the original author's intent (since that was only a placeholder).
   - The original had duplicate `langda` statements which were removed in the generated code - this is actually an improvement.

5. **Validity**:
   - The code is syntactically correct and appears semantically correct based on the original requirements.
   - It properly combines probabilistic facts, neural network predictions, and logical rules.

==============hfw_fine1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the neural network predicates `detect_number` and `detect_operator` as specified. The `detect_all` predicate is also correctly implemented to process lists of images into symbols. The `almost_equal/2` predicate is accurately defined to handle both cases where Y is ground and where it is a variable, fulfilling the requirements. The parsing rules for arithmetic expressions (`parse/2`) are correctly implemented, including handling for addition, subtraction (converted to addition with negative), multiplication, and division (with a check for division by zero). The operator precedence is handled correctly by processing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. The only minor issue is that the subtraction case in the original code uses `parse([-1,*|T], R2)`, which might be less intuitive but is correctly replicated in the generated code. Overall, the generated code meets all requirements and is valid.

==============choose_example_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid implementation of bit-by-bit addition of two numbers using DeepProblog. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The code correctly implements the neural network declarations (`neural1` and `neural2`) as specified in the original code.
   - The `slot` predicate is correctly defined to combine the results from both neural networks.
   - The main addition logic (`add_numbers` and `add_digits`) follows the described processing steps, handling both recursive cases and the base case for final carry.
   - The example usage matches the requirements, showing how to represent and add two numbers in reverse digit order.

2. **Consistency with Original Code**:
   - The neural network declarations are identical to the original code.
   - The `slot` predicate is also identical to the original.
   - The generated code extends the original by implementing the full addition logic that was only described in comments in the original.

3. **Identified Issues**:
   - There are no significant issues. The code correctly handles the addition process and carry propagation.
   - One minor consideration is that the result is built in reverse order (least significant digit first), which is consistent with the requirements but might need to be reversed for human-readable output.

4. **Additional Notes**:
   - The code includes proper handling of the final carry, which was mentioned in the requirements.
   - The recursive logic correctly accumulates results and propagates carries through each digit position.
   - The example provided in the comments correctly demonstrates the expected behavior.

==============addition_mislead_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and improved version of the original code. It correctly implements the functionality described in the original ruleset while adhering to DeepProbLog syntax and conventions. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The `digit/2` predicate is properly defined using `nn/4` instead of the original `lann/4`, which is the correct way to define neural network predicates in DeepProbLog.
   - The recursive `number/3` predicate correctly implements digit sequence to number conversion with proper accumulation.
   - Both addition predicates (`multi_addition/3` and `addition/3`) correctly implement their respective functionalities.

2. **Improvements over original**:
   - Replaces vague `langda` predicates with concrete implementations
   - Properly implements the recursive number conversion with correct little-endian handling
   - Adds missing base case for `number/3`
   - Includes necessary module imports
   - Provides clearer variable naming

3. **Consistency with original**:
   - Maintains all the original functionality
   - Preserves the same predicate names and arities
   - Keeps the neural network integration for digit recognition

4. **Potential issues**:
   - None significant - the code is well-structured and correctly implements the described functionality.

5. **Additional notes**:
   - The code properly handles both single-digit and multi-digit cases
   - The mathematical operations are correctly implemented
   - The neural network integration follows DeepProbLog best practices

==============choose_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a faithful reproduction of the original code, maintaining all the key components and structure. It correctly declares two neural networks (neural1 for the result and neural2 for the carry) with the same input/output specifications as the original. The main 'slot' predicate combines these neural networks exactly as in the original code. The generated code also preserves all the commented-out alternative implementations from the original, including both the simplified neural network declarations and the one-hot encoding version. The langda description is correctly maintained at the end. The code is properly formatted and doesn't introduce any new elements or syntax that would make it invalid. All requirements are met, including the avoidance of the '->' symbol.

==============compare_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a significant improvement over the original code in terms of completeness and syntactic correctness. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Neural Predicates**: The generated code properly defines neural predicates using `nn` syntax, which is correct DeepProblog syntax. The original had an undefined `lann` predicate and an unclear `langda` construct.

2. **Consistency**: The generated code maintains all the core functionality of the original:
   - Keeps the same `hole/4` predicate for swap operations
   - Maintains the same sorting algorithm structure
   - Preserves the `forth_sort/2` wrapper

3. **Improvements**:
   - Properly implements the bubble sort pass with a neural network decision point
   - Uses correct Prolog syntax (variable capitalization, predicate names)
   - Adds missing base cases and recursive cases
   - Provides clear neural network decision points

4. **Validity**: The code is valid DeepProblog that would compile and run (assuming the neural networks are properly defined elsewhere). It correctly implements a neural-guided bubble sort algorithm.

5. **Assumptions**: The generator made reasonable assumptions about the unclear parts of the original code, particularly replacing the `langda` construct with a proper neural network decision.

The only minor note is that the original used `lann` while the generated code uses `nn`, but this is actually a correction since `nn` is the proper DeepProblog syntax.

==============noisy_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of structure and content. Both codes include the neural network predicate for digit classification, the probabilistic fact for noise, and the uniform distribution over 19 possible values. The generated code also correctly avoids using the '->' symbol as specified. However, there are a few points to consider: 1) The generated code separates each uniform distribution statement into individual lines, which is syntactically correct but differs slightly from the original's semicolon-separated format. This does not affect functionality. 2) The lambda expression 'langda(LLM:\

==============noisy_static_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but contains some issues that affect its validity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness of Neural Network Definition**: The `digit/2` predicate definition is correctly preserved from the original code.

2. **Noisy Probability**: The `t(0.1) :: noisy.` declaration is correctly preserved from the original.

3. **Uniform Distribution Implementation**: The generated code attempts to implement the uniform distribution differently from the original. The original uses a `langda` directive with an LLM explanation, while the generated code uses a Prolog implementation with `between/3` and `t(P)`. This implementation is problematic because:
   - It doesn't actually enforce a uniform distribution (all values would have probability 1/19 simultaneously)
   - The `t(P)` calls don't properly create a probabilistic choice between the values
   - This differs significantly from the original's intended behavior

4. **Addition Rules**: The `addition_noisy/3` and `addition/3` rules are correctly preserved from the original.

5. **Main Issue**: The uniform distribution implementation is not valid DeepProbLog code. DeepProbLog doesn't support probabilistic choices in this way (using `between/3` with `t(P)`). The original's approach using `langda` was likely intended to use a proper probabilistic primitive.

6. **Missing Requirement**: The generated code doesn't properly implement the requirement that 'the value V of the predicate uniform(X,Y,V) is chosen randomly from the integers 0 to 18 with equal probability (1/19)' in a way that DeepProbLog can execute.

==============promis_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements all the specified rules and maintains the same logic. The key improvements in the generated code include better readability through clear separation of rules and consistent formatting. The generated code also avoids the '->' symbol as requested. However, there is one minor inconsistency: the original code has a combined rule for 'vlos(X)' with multiple conditions separated by semicolons, while the generated code splits these into separate rules. This does not affect the logical outcome but changes the structural representation. The 'landscape(X)' rule in both codes appears incomplete as it checks for an empty LLM directive, which might not be the intended behavior. Overall, the generated code is valid and meets the requirements.

==============poker_rough1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly maintains the structure and logic of the original, including the probabilistic facts for house rank, neural network for rank prediction, hand definitions, hand rankings, best hand determination, game outcomes, and card distribution. The standardization of variable names (e.g., 'Cards' instead of 'Cards') is a minor but correct improvement. The 'langda' predicates are preserved as placeholders, which is appropriate since they appear to be intended for additional logic. However, the generated code does not address the missing logic for 'pair' and 'threeofakind' hand types, which are referenced in the hand rankings but not defined in the hand predicates. This omission could lead to incomplete functionality when evaluating certain hand types.

==============quicksort_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and complete implementation of the quicksort algorithm in DeepProbLog, addressing all the requirements from the original code while expanding it to be fully functional. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The generated code correctly implements the quicksort algorithm with neural network-based swap decisions
   - The `quicksort/2` predicate now contains the complete recursive logic (partitioning, recursive sorting, and appending)
   - The `partition/4` predicate correctly uses the swap decisions to place elements in left/right partitions
   - All base cases are properly handled (empty list cases)

2. **Consistency with Original**:
   - Maintains all original predicates (swap, quicksort, partition, append, forth_sort)
   - Keeps the same neural network declaration for swap_net
   - Preserves the same interface through forth_sort/2
   - The main improvement is completing the partial quicksort implementation from the original

3. **Improvements**:
   - Replaces the LLM placeholder comment with actual quicksort implementation logic
   - Maintains clean Prolog style with proper recursive definitions
   - All predicates are properly connected to form a working sorting algorithm

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - None identified - the code is syntactically correct and logically complete
   - The neural network swap_net would need to be properly trained for actual use, but this is beyond the code validation scope

5. **DeepProbLog Specifics**:
   - Correctly uses the nn/4 declaration for probabilistic facts
   - Maintains proper integration between logical and neural components
   - Follows DeepProbLog's syntax requirements

==============hfw_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a faithful reproduction of the original code with improved formatting and comments. It maintains all the key components and logic of the original while being more readable. The analysis reveals:

1. **Neural Network Declarations**: Perfectly matches the original with identical network names, input/output formats, and possible output values.

2. **detect_all/2 Predicate**: Exactly replicates the original's recursive structure for processing lists of images into symbols.

3. **almost_equal/2 Predicate**: Maintains the original's dual functionality for both ground and unbound variables with the same comparison tolerance.

4. **expression/2 Predicate**: Correctly combines symbol detection and parsing as in the original.

5. **parse/2 Predicate**: All cases (single number, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are implemented identically to the original, including:
   - The clever subtraction implementation using multiplication by -1
   - Division by zero protection
   - Proper recursive parsing
   - Floating point result handling

6. **Style Improvements**: The generated code adds helpful comments and better formatting while preserving all functionality.

7. **Requirements Compliance**: The code doesn't use the '->' symbol as requested and implements all specified operations.

The generated code is not only valid but also improves upon the original's readability without altering its behavior.

==============any_sum_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and improved version of the original code. It correctly implements the functionality described in the original requirements while adhering to proper Prolog conventions. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The `digit/2` predicate remains unchanged from the original, correctly representing the neural network for digit recognition.
   - The `addition/3` rule is identical to the original and correctly sums two recognized digits.
   - The `anysum/2` implementation is now properly defined using a helper predicate with an accumulator pattern, which is a correct approach for summing list elements in Prolog.

2. **Consistency with Original**:
   - The generated code maintains all the functionality of the original code.
   - It improves upon the original by providing a complete implementation of `anysum` (which was only partially specified in the original).
   - The code follows the requirement of not using the `->` symbol.

3. **Improvements**:
   - The generated code is more complete than the original, providing a working implementation where the original had only a placeholder.
   - The accumulator pattern used in `anysum_helper/3` is more efficient than other possible implementations for summing lists.
   - The code is well-structured and properly commented.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - None identified. The generated code correctly handles all specified requirements and edge cases (like empty lists).

5. **Additional Notes**:
   - The implementation correctly processes each element through the digit recognizer before summing, maintaining consistency with the original digit recognition approach.
   - The helper predicate pattern is an appropriate choice for this kind of recursive calculation.

==============wap_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. First, the generated code includes an empty list `[]` as an additional parameter in the `nn(rnn, [Text], Embedding, [])` declaration, which was not present in the original code. This could cause compatibility issues if the original code does not support this parameter. Second, the `wap` predicate in the generated code is more detailed and follows a logical sequence of operations, which aligns with the requirement to 'Add the smallest two numbers and then subtract the largest'. However, the original `wap` predicate was incomplete and contained placeholders (NET and LLM) that were not defined. The generated code correctly implements the missing logic. Overall, the generated code is a valid and complete implementation of the requirements, but the extra parameter in the `rnn` declaration might need to be removed for full consistency with the original code.

==============poker_rough2_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and maintains the functionality of the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**: The generated code correctly implements all the rules and logic from the original code, including the probabilistic facts for house rank, neural network for rank prediction, hand type definitions, hand rankings, best hand determination, game outcomes, card selection, and game rules.

2. **Consistency**: The generated code is consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. All predicates and rules are preserved, and the variable names are maintained as in the original.

3. **Identified Issues**: 
   - The note about a typo in the original code regarding `Cards` vs `Cards` is misleading because there is no actual typo; the variable name is consistently `Cards` throughout the code.
   - The mention of unmatched parentheses in the `cards` predicates is incorrect; the parentheses in the original code are properly matched.
   - The generated code does not include the `langda` comments from the original code, which might have been intended for documentation or debugging purposes.

4. **Additional Observations**: 
   - The generated code is well-formatted and easier to read due to consistent spacing and indentation.
   - The comments in the generated code are helpful for understanding the different sections of the code.

Overall, the generated code is valid and fits the requirements, with only minor discrepancies that do not affect functionality.

==============promis_fine_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code, with several improvements and clarifications. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The generated code correctly implements all the rules from the original code.
   - The separation of disjunctive conditions in `vlos/1` and `permits/1` into multiple clauses is syntactically correct and improves readability.
   - The addition of `valid_mission/1` correctly implements the two conditions mentioned in the `landscape/1` description.

2. **Consistency with Original Code**:
   - All original predicates (`initial_charge`, `charge_cost`, `weight`, `fog/clear`, `langda`, `vlos`, `can_return`, `landscape`, `permits`) are preserved.
   - The numerical relationships and probability distributions are maintained exactly as in the original.
   - The natural language annotations in the `langda` predicates are preserved.

3. **Improvements**:
   - The generated code is more modular and readable due to the separation of disjunctive conditions.
   - The explicit `valid_mission/1` predicate makes the mission validity conditions clearer.
   - The bomb warning check (`not(langda(_, \

==============quicksort_superrough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a direct copy of the original code with added comments and formatting. It maintains the same neural network declaration for the swap operation and the LLM prompt for quick sort. The code is syntactically correct for DeepProbLog and does not introduce any new elements or modifications that would make it invalid. The requirement to avoid using the '->' symbol has been respected, as there was no such symbol in the original code to begin with. The generated code is consistent with the original in both structure and functionality.

==============addition_normal_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and improved version of the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The generated code correctly implements all the specified functionality from the original code.
   - The `digit/2` predicate properly uses the MNIST network for digit classification.
   - The recursive `number/3` predicate correctly builds multi-digit numbers from image lists.
   - Both addition predicates (`multi_addition/3` and `addition/3`) correctly perform their specified operations.

2. **Improvements over Original**:
   - The generated code replaces the vague `langda` predicates with concrete implementations.
   - It properly implements the recursive number building that was only described in comments in the original.
   - It includes proper arithmetic operations instead of placeholder descriptions.
   - The code structure is clearer with proper predicate definitions and comments.

3. **Consistency with Original**:
   - Maintains all the same predicate names and functionality from the original.
   - Implements the low-bit first order as specified in the original comments.
   - Keeps the separation between single-digit and multi-digit addition.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The only minor issue is that the original mentioned 'pick the output from one of there value' which had a typo ('there' instead of 'these'), but this doesn't affect functionality.
   - The generated code doesn't include the `FUP:\

==============hfw_similar_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the neural network predicates for digit and operator recognition, the helper predicate to detect all symbols in the image sequence, and the main expression evaluation predicate. The `almost_equal` predicate is correctly defined with the requested precision of 0.0001. The `parse` predicate handles all arithmetic operations with proper precedence, including a check for division by zero. The subtraction case is correctly converted to addition with a negative number. The code follows standard Prolog syntax and avoids using the '->' symbol as requested. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the subtraction case where the original code uses `parse([-1,*|T],R2)` while the generated code uses `parse([-1,*|T], R2)`. This does not affect the functionality of the code but is a slight deviation from the original. Overall, the generated code is valid and fits the requirements.

==============compare_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and improves upon the original code in several ways. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Neural Predicate Syntax**: The generated code correctly uses `nn` instead of `lann` for neural predicates, which is the proper DeepProblog syntax.

2. **Added Neural Network**: The code introduces `bubble_net` to handle comparison and swapping decisions during the bubble pass, which was missing in the original code (where it used `langda`). This makes the implementation more complete.

3. **Logical Structure**: The recursive cases and base cases maintain proper logical structure for bubble sort:
   - The `bubble/3` predicate correctly handles both base and recursive cases
   - The `bubblesort/3` predicate properly accumulates the sorted elements
   - The wrapper predicate `forth_sort/2` is correctly implemented

4. **Consistency with Original**: The generated code preserves all the functionality described in the original while fixing syntax issues.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The `bubble_net` neural network is referenced but not defined in the code (though this might be defined separately)
   - The original code's `langda` placeholder for the main bubble sort body has been properly implemented

6. **Improvements**:
   - Better variable naming (e.g., `L3` instead of unspecified variables)
   - More complete implementation of the bubble sort algorithm
   - Proper handling of neural network decisions

==============hfw_rough1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. The original code did not include the 'parse' and 'compute' predicates, which are added in the generated code. While these additions provide functionality for evaluating mathematical expressions, they were not part of the original specification. The generated code maintains the neural network declarations, helper predicates, and documentation predicates from the original code. The structure and logic of the code are sound, and it avoids using the '->' symbol as requested. However, the addition of the 'parse' and 'compute' predicates, while useful, deviates from the original code's specification.

==============hfw_base_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the neural network predicates for digit and operator recognition, the helper predicate for floating point comparison, and the main expression evaluation predicate. The recursive `parse/2` predicate is also correctly implemented with handling for single numbers, addition, subtraction (converted to addition with negative), multiplication, and division (with zero division check). The code follows standard Prolog syntax and avoids using the '->' symbol as requested. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the subtraction case where the original code uses `parse([-1,*|T],R2)` while the generated code uses `parse([-1,*|T], R2)`. This does not affect the functionality of the code but is a slight deviation from the original. Overall, the generated code is valid and fits the requirements.
