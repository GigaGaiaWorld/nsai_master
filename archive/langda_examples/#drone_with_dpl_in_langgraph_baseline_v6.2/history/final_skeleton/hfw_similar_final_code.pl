Here's the complete DeepProbLog code based on the provided ruleset:

```prolog
% Neural network predicates for digit and operator recognition
nn(net1, [X], Y, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: detect_number(X, Y).
nn(net2, [X], Y, [+,-,*,/]) :: detect_operator(X, Y).

% Helper predicate to detect all symbols in the image sequence
detect_all([N], [N2]) :- detect_number(N, N2).
detect_all([N,O|T], [N2,O2|T2]) :- 
    detect_number(N, N2), 
    detect_operator(O, O2), 
    detect_all(T, T2).

% Define almost_equal with precision 0.0001
almost_equal(X, Y) :- abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.

% Main expression evaluation predicate
expression(Images, Result) :- 
    detect_all(Images, Symbols),
    parse(Symbols, Result).

% Base case for single number
parse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R).

% Addition case
parse([N1,+|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).

% Subtraction case (converted to addition with negative)
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
    parse([-1,*|T], R2),
    almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).

% Multiplication case
parse([N1,*,N2|T], R) :-
    N3 is N1 * N2,
    parse([N3|T], R).

% Division case (with check for division by zero)
parse([N1,/,N2|T], R) :-
    N2 \== 0,
    N3 is N1 / N2,
    parse([N3|T], R).
```

Key points about this implementation:
1. It includes both neural network declarations for digit and operator recognition
2. The `detect_all` predicate processes a sequence of images into symbols
3. The `almost_equal` predicate is defined with the requested precision
4. The `parse` predicate handles all arithmetic operations with proper precedence
5. Division includes a check for division by zero
6. Subtraction is handled by converting it to addition with a negative number

The code follows standard Prolog syntax and avoids using the '->' symbol as requested.
