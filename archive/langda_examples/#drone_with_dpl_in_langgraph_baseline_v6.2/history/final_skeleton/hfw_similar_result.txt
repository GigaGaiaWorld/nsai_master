The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the neural network predicates for digit and operator recognition, the helper predicate to detect all symbols in the image sequence, and the main expression evaluation predicate. The `almost_equal` predicate is correctly defined with the requested precision of 0.0001. The `parse` predicate handles all arithmetic operations with proper precedence, including a check for division by zero. The subtraction case is correctly converted to addition with a negative number. The code follows standard Prolog syntax and avoids using the '->' symbol as requested. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the subtraction case where the original code uses `parse([-1,*|T],R2)` while the generated code uses `parse([-1,*|T], R2)`. This does not affect the functionality of the code but is a slight deviation from the original. Overall, the generated code is valid and fits the requirements.
