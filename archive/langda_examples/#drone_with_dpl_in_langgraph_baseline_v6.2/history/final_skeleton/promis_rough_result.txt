The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements all the specified rules and maintains the same logic. The key improvements in the generated code include better readability through clear separation of rules and consistent formatting. The generated code also avoids the '->' symbol as requested. However, there is one minor inconsistency: the original code has a combined rule for 'vlos(X)' with multiple conditions separated by semicolons, while the generated code splits these into separate rules. This does not affect the logical outcome but changes the structural representation. The 'landscape(X)' rule in both codes appears incomplete as it checks for an empty LLM directive, which might not be the intended behavior. Overall, the generated code is valid and meets the requirements.
