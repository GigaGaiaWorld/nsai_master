Here's the complete DeepProbLog code based on the provided ruleset and requirements:

```prolog
% Neural network for swap decision
nn(swap_net, [X,Y], Z, [no_swap, swap]) :: swap(X,Y,Z).

% Quicksort predicate
quicksort([X|Xs], Ys) :-
    partition(Xs, X, Left, Right),
    quicksort(Left, SortedLeft),
    quicksort(Right, SortedRight),
    append(SortedLeft, [X|SortedRight], Ys).
quicksort([], []).

% Partition predicate with swap decisions
partition([X|Xs], Y, [X|Ls], Rs) :-
    swap(X, Y, swap),
    partition(Xs, Y, Ls, Rs).
partition([X|Xs], Y, Ls, [X|Rs]) :-
    swap(X, Y, no_swap),
    partition(Xs, Y, Ls, Rs).
partition([], _, [], []).

% Append predicate
append([], Ys, Ys).
append([X|Xs], Ys, [X|Zs]) :-
    append(Xs, Ys, Zs).

% Main sorting predicate
forth_sort(L, L2) :-
    quicksort(L, L2).
```

Key points about this implementation:
1. The `swap_net` neural network is defined to make swap decisions between two elements
2. The quicksort implementation follows the standard recursive pattern:
   - Partition the list around a pivot
   - Recursively sort the sublists
   - Combine the results
3. The partition predicate uses the swap decisions to determine element placement
4. The basic list operations (append) are included
5. The main interface is through `forth_sort/2` which calls quicksort

Note that I've expanded the quicksort predicate to include the full logic rather than the placeholder comment, while maintaining all the functionality from the original ruleset.
