The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. First, the original code uses 'lann' for the neural network declaration, while the generated code uses 'nn'. Although 'nn' is a valid DeepProbLog predicate, it does not match the original code's 'lann'. Second, the generated code correctly implements the addition rule by first recognizing the digits in the input images and then calculating their sum, which aligns with the original intention. The 'langda' predicate is correctly declared and used in both the original and generated code. The generated code avoids using the '->' symbol as requested. Overall, the generated code is functionally correct and meets the requirements, but it does not perfectly match the original code's syntax.
