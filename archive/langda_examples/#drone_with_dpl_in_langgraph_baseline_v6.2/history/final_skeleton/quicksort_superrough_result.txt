The generated code is a direct copy of the original code with added comments and formatting. It maintains the same neural network declaration for the swap operation and the LLM prompt for quick sort. The code is syntactically correct for DeepProbLog and does not introduce any new elements or modifications that would make it invalid. The requirement to avoid using the '->' symbol has been respected, as there was no such symbol in the original code to begin with. The generated code is consistent with the original in both structure and functionality.
