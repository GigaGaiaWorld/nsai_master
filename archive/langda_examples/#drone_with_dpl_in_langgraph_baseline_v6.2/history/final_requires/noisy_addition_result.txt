The generated code is mostly valid and fits the requirements, but there are a few points to consider. The code defines the addition_noisy/3 predicate with two clauses: one for the base case where the sum Z is calculated from the actual digits X1 and Y1, and another for the noisy case where a uniform random number U is used instead. The noisy case is correctly conditioned on the noisy predicate, which has a probability of 0.1 as defined in the original code. The generated code follows the Problog syntax and does not use the '->' symbol, which is a requirement. However, the uniform/3 predicate in the noisy case should be defined with three arguments, but the generated code uses it with two arguments (X and Y), which is inconsistent with the original code where uniform/3 is defined with three arguments (X, Y, and a value). This inconsistency could lead to issues. Despite this, the overall structure and intent of the generated code align with the requirements.
