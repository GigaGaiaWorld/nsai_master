Here's the completed code with the placeholders filled according to the requirements:

```prolog
nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).

number([],Result,Result).
number([H|T],Acc,Result) :- 
    digit(H,D),
    NewAcc is Acc + D * (10 ** length(T)),
    number(T, NewAcc, Result).
number(X,Y) :- number(X,0,Y).

multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
    number(X,0,X1),
    number(Y,0,Y1),
    Z is X1 + Y1.

addition(X1,X2,Z) :- 
    digit(X1,D1),
    digit(X2,D2),
    Z is D1 + D2.
```

Explanation:
1. For the first placeholder (3BD8A6E2):
   - Recursively processes the image list [H|T]
   - For each digit image H, gets its value D using the mnist network
   - Calculates the new accumulator value by adding D multiplied by 10^position
   - Continues processing the tail T with the new accumulator

2. For the second placeholder (4A20D0D6):
   - Converts both input sequences X and Y to numbers using number/2
   - Adds the resulting numbers together to get Z

3. For the third placeholder (F9EBF407):
   - Uses the mnist network to recognize digits X1 and X2
   - Adds the recognized digit values D1 and D2 to get Z

The code maintains the original structure while implementing the required functionality for each placeholder.
