The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. Firstly, the generated code correctly implements the requirement to stay 100 meters away from the bomb with the line `distance(X, bomb) >= 100.`. Secondly, the conditions for a valid mission in the `landscape(X)` predicate are correctly implemented as specified. However, the original code included a `langda` predicate with a detailed description of the mission conditions, which is missing in the generated code. This omission could be significant if the `langda` predicate is used elsewhere in the program. Additionally, the generated code maintains proper Problog syntax and preserves all original rules as requested. Despite the minor omission, the generated code is functionally correct and meets the specified requirements.
