Here's the code that fits in the {{LANGDA}} placeholder, meeting all the requirements:

```prolog
almost_equal(X,Y) :- 
    ground(Y), 
    Xf is float(X), 
    Yf is float(Y), 
    abs(Xf - Yf) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X,Y) :- 
    var(Y), 
    Y is float(X).
```

This code:
1. Defines the `almost_equal/2` predicate as required
2. Checks if Y is ground (has a value) in the first clause
3. Converts both X and Y to floats and checks if their difference is less than 0.0001
4. In the second clause, if Y is unbound (var(Y)), simply unifies Y with X converted to float
5. Avoids using the '->' symbol as requested
6. Uses proper Prolog syntax with correct variable naming and float conversion
