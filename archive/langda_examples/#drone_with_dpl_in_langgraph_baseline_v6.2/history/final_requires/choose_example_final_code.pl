Here's the complete code that fits in the {LANGDA} placeholder:

```prolog
add([],[],C,[C]) :- C > 0.
add([],[],_,[]).
add([H1|T1],[H2|T2],C0,[O|T]) :-
    slot(H1,H2,C0,C1,O),
    add(T1,T2,C1,T).
```

This code implements bit-by-bit addition of two numbers represented as lists (LSB first) with carry propagation. The rules work as follows:
1. Base case when both lists are empty but there's a remaining carry
2. Base case when both lists are empty and no carry remains
3. Recursive case that processes each digit pair and carry, then continues with the rest of the digits and new carry

The code matches the example given where [7,4,3] + [8,6,5] with initial carry 0 would produce [5,1,9,0] (which is 915 when read normally).
