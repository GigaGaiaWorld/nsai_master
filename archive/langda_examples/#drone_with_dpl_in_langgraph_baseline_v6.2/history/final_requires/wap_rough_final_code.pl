Here's the complete code that fits in the {LANGDA} placeholder:

```
rnn(Text,Embedding),
net1(Embedding,P),
permute(P,X1,X2,X3,A,B,C),
net3(Embedding,Swap),
swap(Swap,B,C,B1,C1),
net2(Embedding,Op1),
operator(Op1,A,B1,Res1),
net4(Embedding,Op2),
operator(Op2,Res1,C1,Out).
```

This code:
1. Uses all required networks (rnn, net1, net2, net3, net4)
2. Follows the requirement to "Add the smallest two numbers and then subtract the largest" by:
   - First permuting the numbers to get them in order
   - Then adding the two smaller numbers
   - Finally subtracting the largest number
3. Maintains proper Problog syntax without using '->'
4. Fits completely within the placeholder
5. Matches the hash tag EC80EE82 requirements
