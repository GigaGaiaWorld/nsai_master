Here's the complete code that fits in the {LANGDA} placeholder for the quicksort/2 predicate:

```prolog
    partition(Xs,X,Littles,Bigs),
    quicksort(Littles,Ls),
    quicksort(Bigs,Bs),
    append(Ls,[X|Bs],Ys).
```

This code:
1. Takes the head X and tail Xs of the input list
2. Partitions Xs into elements less than X (Littles) and greater than X (Bigs)
3. Recursively sorts both partitions
4. Combines the sorted partitions with X in the middle

The code maintains proper Prolog syntax and doesn't use the '->' symbol as requested. It completes the quicksort implementation by handling the recursive case after the base case (empty list) that's already defined in the original code.
