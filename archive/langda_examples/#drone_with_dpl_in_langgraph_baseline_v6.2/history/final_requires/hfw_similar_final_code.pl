Here's the code that fits in the {{LANGDA}} placeholder:

```prolog
almost_equal(X,Y) :- abs(X-Y) < 0.0001.
```

This code:
1. Defines the `almost_equal/2` predicate as required
2. Uses a precision of 0.0001 for comparing numbers
3. Uses simple Prolog syntax without the '->' symbol
4. Fits completely within the placeholder
5. Matches the requirements from hash 5035696B

The complete rule will compare two numbers and succeed if their absolute difference is less than 0.0001.
