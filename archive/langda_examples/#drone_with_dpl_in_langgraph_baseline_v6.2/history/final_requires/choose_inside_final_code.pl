Here's the code that fits in the {LANGDA} placeholder:

```
slot(H1,H2,C,C2,Digit),
add(T1,T2,C2,Carry,Res).
```

This code:
1. Uses the slot/5 predicate to calculate the current digit (Digit) and new carry (C2) from inputs H1, H2 and current carry C
2. Recursively processes the tails of the lists (T1, T2) with the new carry (C2)
3. Builds the result list by prepending Digit to Res
4. Maintains the carry through the recursion until the base case is reached

The code maintains the correct Problog syntax and fits within the specified placeholder while implementing the addition logic for multi-digit numbers with carry propagation.
