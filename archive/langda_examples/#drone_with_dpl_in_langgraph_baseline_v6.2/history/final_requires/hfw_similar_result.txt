The generated code correctly defines the `almost_equal/2` predicate as required by the original code. It uses a precision of 0.0001 for comparing numbers, which matches the requirement specified in the `langda` directive. The predicate is implemented using simple Prolog syntax without any unnecessary symbols, making it clean and efficient. The implementation fits completely within the placeholder and matches the requirements from hash 5035696B. The generated code is consistent with the original code's intent and functionality, and there are no identified issues.
