Based on the requirements, here's the code that should fit in the {LANGDA} placeholder:

```
hole(H1,H2,X1,Y), swap_net([H1,H2],Z), hole(X1,Y,H1,H2), bubble([Y|T],T1,X).
```

This code:
1. Uses the `hole` predicate to handle potential swaps
2. Calls the `swap_net` neural network to determine if a swap should occur
3. Uses another `hole` predicate to get the correct order of elements
4. Continues the bubble sort process recursively with the remaining elements

The code follows the single-pass traversal process of the bubble algorithm while maintaining the Problog syntax and not using the '->' symbol. It properly integrates with the surrounding bubble sort implementation and uses the defined neural network `swap_net`.
