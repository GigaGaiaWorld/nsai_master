The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the neural network predicates `detect_number` and `detect_operator` using `net1` and `net2`. The `detect_all` predicate correctly processes lists of numbers and operators. The `almost_equal` predicate is correctly defined with two clauses for handling both ground and variable cases. The `expression` and `parse` predicates are correctly implemented to handle arithmetic expressions and their parsing. The generated code maintains the original logic and structure while fixing minor issues such as typographical errors and ensuring proper decimal places in the `almost_equal` comparison. The formatting is consistent, and all rules are properly terminated with periods.
