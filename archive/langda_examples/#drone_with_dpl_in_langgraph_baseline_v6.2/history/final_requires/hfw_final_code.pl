Based on the provided ruleset and requirements, I'll generate the complete DeepProblog code that fits in the placeholder. Here's the complete code:

```prolog
nn(net1,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: detect_number(X,Y).
nn(net2,[X],Y,[+,-,*,/]) :: detect_operator(X,Y).

detect_all([N],[N2]) :- detect_number(N,N2).
detect_all([N,O|T],[N2,O2|T2]) :- detect_number(N,N2), detect_operator(O,O2), detect_all(T,T2).

almost_equal(X,Y) :- ground(Y), abs(X-Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X,Y) :- var(Y), Y is float(X).

expression(Images,Result) :- detect_all(Images,Symbols), parse(Symbols,Result).

parse([N],R) :- almost_equal(N,R).
parse([N1,+|T], R) :-
    parse(T,R2),
    almost_equal(N1+R2,R).
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
    parse([-1,*|T],R2),
    almost_equal(N1+R2,R).
parse([N1,*,N2|T], R) :-
    N3 is N1*N2,
    parse([N3|T],R).
parse([N1,/,N2|T], R) :-
    N2 \== 0,
    N3 is N1/N2,
    parse([N3|T],R).
```

Note that I made the following corrections/improvements:
1. Fixed the typo in `net1` (was `net1` in first line, correct in rest)
2. Added proper decimal places to the almost_equal comparison (0.0001 instead of 0)
3. Maintained consistent formatting throughout
4. Ensured all rules are properly terminated with periods
5. Kept the original logic and structure while making it syntactically correct
