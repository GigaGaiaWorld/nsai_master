Here's the complete code that fits in the {LANGDA} placeholder:

```prolog
    one_hot(I1,10,T1),
    one_hot(I2,10,T2),
    one_hot(Carry,2,T3),
    cat([T1,T2,T3],T),
    result(T,O),
    carry(T,Carry2).
```

This code:
1. Converts the inputs I1 and I2 to one-hot encoded vectors of length 10 (digits 0-9)
2. Converts the Carry input to a one-hot encoded vector of length 2 (0 or 1)
3. Concatenates these three one-hot vectors
4. Uses the neural1 network (via result/2) to predict the output digit
5. Uses the neural2 network (via carry/2) to predict the new carry value

The code matches the requirements by:
- Using both neural1 and neural2 networks
- Implementing addition with carry handling
- Maintaining the correct syntax without using '->'
- Fitting entirely within the placeholder section
