Here's the code that fits in the {{LANGDA}} placeholder to define the addition_noisy/3 predicate:

```prolog
addition_noisy(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,X1), digit(Y,Y1), Z is X1 + Y1.
addition_noisy(X,Y,Z) :- noisy, uniform(X,Y,U), Z is U.
```

This code:
1. Defines the base case where the sum Z is calculated from the actual digits X1 and Y1
2. Defines the noisy case where with probability 0.1 (from t(0.1) a uniform random number U is used instead
3. Follows the Problog syntax without using the '->' symbol
4. Matches the FE04E306 hash tag requirement for addition_noisy/3
5. Fits completely within the {{LANGDA}} placeholder
