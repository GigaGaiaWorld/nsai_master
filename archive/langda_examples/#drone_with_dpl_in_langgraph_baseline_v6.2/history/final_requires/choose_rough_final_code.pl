Here's the code that fits in the {LANGDA} placeholder to implement bit-by-bit addition of two numbers:

```prolog
add_bits([],[],Carry,[Carry]) :- Carry > 0.
add_bits([],[],_,[]).
add_bits([I1|T1],[I2|T2],Carry,[O|T]) :-
    slot(I1,I2,Carry,NewCarry,O),
    add_bits(T1,T2,NewCarry,T).
```

This code:
1. Handles addition of two numbers represented as lists of bits (LSB first)
2. Uses the `slot/5` predicate defined above which combines the neural network predictions
3. Recursively processes each bit pair with carry propagation
4. Includes base cases for when input lists are empty
5. Properly handles final carry if present

The implementation follows standard Prolog recursion patterns for list processing while maintaining the bit-addition logic with carry propagation.
