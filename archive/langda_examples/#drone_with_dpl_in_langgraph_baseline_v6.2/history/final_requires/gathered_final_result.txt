==============choose_inside_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. It correctly implements the addition logic for multi-digit numbers with carry propagation. The code uses the slot/5 predicate to calculate the current digit (Digit) and new carry (C2) from inputs H1, H2, and current carry C. It then recursively processes the tails of the lists (T1, T2) with the new carry (C2) and builds the result list by prepending Digit to Res. The code maintains the correct Problog syntax and is consistent with the original code's structure and logic. There are no identified issues with the generated code.

==============choose_outside_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. It correctly implements the logic for the add/5 predicate, which is designed to handle the addition of two lists of digits with carry propagation. The code uses the slot/5 predicate as defined in the original code to compute the current digit and new carry for each pair of digits from the input lists. It then recursively processes the tails of the lists, maintaining the carry for the next iteration. The generated code is consistent with the original code's style and logic, and it adheres to Problog syntax without using any imperative constructs like '->'. The predicate head matches exactly what was requested in the placeholder, and the implementation correctly handles the carry propagation and digit computation.

==============choose_simple_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. It correctly implements the addition operation with carry handling by using one-hot encoding for the inputs and then concatenating them before passing to the neural networks. The generated code is consistent with the original code's intent, as it uses both neural1 and neural2 networks to predict the output digit and the new carry value, respectively. The syntax is correct and does not use '->', adhering to the requirements. The code fits entirely within the placeholder section and maintains the correct structure for the addition operation.

==============simple_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and improved version of the original code. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The generated code correctly implements digit recognition using `nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).` which is the proper DeepProbLog syntax for neural network predicates (replacing the original 'lann' with standard 'nn').
   - The addition predicate is correctly implemented to first recognize digits from two images and then sum them, which matches the intended functionality described in the original code's comments.

2. **Consistency with Original**:
   - The core functionality (digit recognition and addition) is preserved while using proper DeepProbLog syntax.
   - The original used non-standard predicates ('lann', 'langda') which have been replaced with standard DeepProbLog constructs.
   - The neural network output range [0-9] is correctly maintained.

3. **Improvements**:
   - Removed unnecessary/unused parameters (LLM, FUP) from the original.
   - Implemented the addition in a clear, logical way using standard Prolog arithmetic ('is').
   - The code is more concise while being more semantically correct for DeepProbLog.

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - None. The generated code properly addresses all requirements and improves upon the original.

The code is valid DeepProbLog that performs MNIST digit recognition and addition of recognized digits.

==============any_sum_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code attempts to calculate the sum of numbers in a bag using a custom predicate `bag_sum/3` and then unifies the result with R. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. The predicate `bag_sum/3` is not a standard Prolog or DeepProbLog predicate, and it's not defined in the original code or in common libraries. This makes the code invalid unless this predicate is defined elsewhere.

2. The line `R is R` is redundant and doesn't serve any purpose - it's essentially saying 'R is itself', which is always true but doesn't perform any calculation or validation.

3. The generated code doesn't maintain consistency with the original code's structure. The original `anysum/2` predicate was meant to interface with a language model (as indicated by `langda(LLM:\

==============poker_rough3_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. First, the generated code introduces a new predicate `house_rank/2` which was not present in the original code. This predicate is used to get the rank value of the house card, but it conflicts with the existing probabilistic fact `house_rank/1` defined in the original code. This could lead to ambiguity and potential runtime errors. Second, the generated code leaves the third `langda` placeholder empty, which is acceptable since the `game/3` predicate was already completed. The rest of the code maintains proper Prolog syntax and follows the requirements by not using the '->' symbol and keeping all generated code within the placeholder sections. The main game logic in the `game/3` predicate is correctly implemented, getting both players' cards, determining their best hand ranks, and computing the outcome.

==============hfw_fine1_result.txt:==============
The generated code for the `almost_equal/2` predicate is valid and meets all the specified requirements. It correctly handles both cases where Y is ground and where Y is unbound. When Y is ground, it converts both X and Y to floats and checks if their absolute difference is less than 0.0001. When Y is unbound, it simply unifies Y with X converted to a float. The code is consistent with the original code's requirements and uses proper Prolog syntax without any issues. The variable naming and float conversion are correctly implemented, and the code avoids using the '->' symbol as requested.

==============choose_example_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and fits the requirements for implementing bit-by-bit addition of two numbers represented as lists (LSB first) with carry propagation. The code correctly handles the base cases when both lists are empty, accounting for any remaining carry, and the recursive case processes each digit pair and carry, continuing with the rest of the digits and the new carry. The generated code is consistent with the original code's functionality, as it uses the `slot/5` predicate defined in the original code to compute the result and carry for each digit pair. However, there is a minor issue in the first base case: `add([],[],C,[C]) :- C > 0.` should ideally also check that `C` is a valid carry (i.e., 0 or 1) to ensure correctness, though in practice, the `carry/4` predicate from the original code should only produce 0 or 1. Overall, the generated code is valid and meets the requirements.

==============addition_mislead_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and fits the requirements, but there are some inconsistencies and potential issues when compared to the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The `nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).` line correctly replaces the original `lann` declaration with `nn`, which is the standard way to define neural networks in DeepProbLog.
   - The `number/3` predicate is correctly implemented to recursively process the list of images and construct the corresponding multi-bit integer.
   - The `multi_addition/3` predicate correctly converts the sequences to numbers and adds them.
   - The `addition/3` predicate correctly recognizes digits and adds them.

2. **Consistency with Original Code**:
   - The generated code replaces `lann` with `nn`, which is consistent with DeepProbLog syntax.
   - The generated code does not use the `langda` predicate as in the original code, but the functionality is correctly implemented using standard Prolog predicates.
   - The generated code maintains the same predicate names and arities as the original code.

3. **Identified Issues**:
   - The original code uses `langda` with specific annotations (NET, LLM, FUP), which are not preserved in the generated code. If these annotations were meant to be part of the functionality, their absence could be an issue.
   - The `number/3` predicate in the generated code uses `10 ** length(T)` to calculate the positional value, which assumes the digits are in low-bit first order. However, the original code's annotation mentions 'low-bit first order', but the implementation might not correctly handle this if the list is in high-bit first order.
   - The original code's `addition/3` predicate mentions using 'X1 and X2 as term first', but the generated code does not explicitly handle this, though it does use X1 and X2 as terms.

4. **Overall Validity**:
   - The generated code is functionally correct and implements the required behavior.
   - It adheres to DeepProbLog syntax and Prolog conventions.
   - Minor inconsistencies with the original code's annotations and comments do not affect the core functionality.

==============choose_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid implementation of bit-by-bit addition of two numbers represented as lists of bits (LSB first). It correctly uses the `slot/5` predicate defined in the original code, which combines the neural network predictions for result and carry. The code handles the base cases for empty input lists and properly propagates the carry through recursive calls. The implementation is consistent with the original code's structure and requirements, effectively utilizing the neural network predicates (`result/4` and `carry/4`) within the `slot/5` predicate. No issues are identified in the generated code.

==============compare_result.txt:==============
The generated code is not valid for several reasons. First, the predicate `hole(H1,H2,X1,Y)` is called with four arguments, but the original `hole` predicate only accepts two or four arguments in specific patterns (hole(X,Y,X,Y) or hole(X,Y,Y,X)). The usage here doesn't match either pattern. Second, the call to `swap_net([H1,H2],Z)` doesn't match the original declaration which expects four arguments (lann(swap_net:\

==============noisy_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and fits the requirements, but there are a few points to consider. The code defines the addition_noisy/3 predicate with two clauses: one for the base case where the sum Z is calculated from the actual digits X1 and Y1, and another for the noisy case where a uniform random number U is used instead. The noisy case is correctly conditioned on the noisy predicate, which has a probability of 0.1 as defined in the original code. The generated code follows the Problog syntax and does not use the '->' symbol, which is a requirement. However, the uniform/3 predicate in the noisy case should be defined with three arguments, but the generated code uses it with two arguments (X and Y), which is inconsistent with the original code where uniform/3 is defined with three arguments (X, Y, and a value). This inconsistency could lead to issues. Despite this, the overall structure and intent of the generated code align with the requirements.

==============noisy_static_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits all the requirements specified. It correctly defines a uniform distribution for values 0 through 18, assigning equal probability (1/19) to each possible value. The syntax used is appropriate for Problog and does not include the '->' symbol, which aligns with the requirements. The code fits completely within the {{LANGDA}} placeholder and matches the hash tag requirement 9B4AB2A2. Additionally, the generated code is consistent with the original code's intent of defining a uniform distribution for the predicate uniform(X,Y,V). There are no identified issues with the generated code.

==============promis_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. First, the generated code introduces a new predicate `safe_distance(X)` which is not present in the original code, but it logically fits the requirement implied by the `langda(LLM:\

==============poker_rough1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. The first placeholder correctly implements the `hand/2` predicate with rules for `pair(R)` and `threeofakind(R)`, which are consistent with the original code's style and functionality. The second placeholder correctly implements the `game/3` predicate to determine the outcome between two hands by using `best_hand_rank/2` and `outcome/3`, which aligns with the original code's logic. Both segments follow the exact syntax requirements without using '->' and match the provided hash tags for verification. The generated code fits perfectly within the placeholder locations in the original code and maintains consistency with the original code's structure and logic.

==============quicksort_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly correct and fits the requirements for completing the quicksort/2 predicate. It maintains proper Prolog syntax and follows the logical structure of quicksort by partitioning the list and recursively sorting the partitions. However, there are a few issues to note: 1) The variable 'Xs' in the partition call should be matched with the tail of the input list, which is not explicitly shown in the generated code. 2) The generated code assumes that 'partition/4' will handle the comparison logic, but the original code uses a neural predicate 'swap/3' for this purpose, which might lead to inconsistency if not properly integrated. 3) The generated code does not explicitly show the handling of the head element 'X' from the input list [X|Xs], though it's implicitly used in the partition call.

==============hfw_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the neural network predicates `detect_number` and `detect_operator` using `net1` and `net2`. The `detect_all` predicate correctly processes lists of numbers and operators. The `almost_equal` predicate is correctly defined with two clauses for handling both ground and variable cases. The `expression` and `parse` predicates are correctly implemented to handle arithmetic expressions and their parsing. The generated code maintains the original logic and structure while fixing minor issues such as typographical errors and ensuring proper decimal places in the `almost_equal` comparison. The formatting is consistent, and all rules are properly terminated with periods.

==============any_sum_result.txt:==============
The generated code partially fits the requirements but has significant issues. The original code's intention for `anysum/2` is to calculate the sum of all numbers in `Bag`, but the generated code only sums one element due to its use of `member/2` without aggregation. The note in the generated code correctly identifies this limitation and suggests a recursive approach for a complete solution, which would be more appropriate. However, the suggested recursive solution does not fit the placeholder constraint as specified. The generated code is consistent with the use of `member/2` but fails to fulfill the original requirement of summing all elements in `Bag`.

==============wap_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and follows the structure of the original code. It correctly uses all the required networks (rnn, net1, net2, net3, net4) and maintains proper Problog syntax. The code also adheres to the requirement of 'Add the smallest two numbers and then subtract the largest' by permuting the numbers, adding the two smaller numbers, and then subtracting the largest number. However, there are a few issues: 1. The variable 'NET' and 'LLM' in the original code's 'wap' predicate are not utilized in the generated code. 2. The generated code does not explicitly ensure that the numbers are ordered (smallest to largest) before performing the operations, which is implied by the requirement. Despite these minor issues, the generated code is functionally correct and fits the requirements.

==============poker_rough2_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code. It correctly adds the rules for detecting straight hands (both low and high) in the first placeholder, which was missing in the original code. The syntax and structure are maintained accurately, and the added rules fit logically within the existing framework. However, there is a minor inconsistency: the generated code does not include the 'langda' comments that were present in the original code ('Supplementary logic of hand/2' and 'Supplementary logic of game/3'). While these comments do not affect the functionality, their absence makes the generated code slightly less consistent with the original. The second placeholder is correctly left empty as it appears to be at the end of the file before the game rules. Overall, the generated code is functionally correct and adheres to the requirements.

==============promis_fine_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. Firstly, the generated code correctly implements the requirement to stay 100 meters away from the bomb with the line `distance(X, bomb) >= 100.`. Secondly, the conditions for a valid mission in the `landscape(X)` predicate are correctly implemented as specified. However, the original code included a `langda` predicate with a detailed description of the mission conditions, which is missing in the generated code. This omission could be significant if the `langda` predicate is used elsewhere in the program. Additionally, the generated code maintains proper Problog syntax and preserves all original rules as requested. Despite the minor omission, the generated code is functionally correct and meets the specified requirements.

==============quicksort_superrough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid implementation of a quicksort algorithm in DeepProblog, maintaining consistency with the original code's structure and requirements. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**: The code correctly implements the quicksort algorithm, including the partitioning step where the `swap` neural network predicate is used to decide whether elements should be swapped. The base case and recursive cases for `quick_sort` are correctly defined, and the `partition` predicate properly handles the partitioning logic based on the swap decisions.

2. **Consistency with Original Code**: The generated code retains the `nn(swap_net, [X,Y],Z,[no_swap, swap]) :: swap(X,Y,Z).` declaration from the original code, ensuring that the neural network's role in the sorting process is preserved. The rest of the code builds upon this foundation to implement the quicksort algorithm.

3. **Syntax and Requirements**: The code adheres to Problog syntax and avoids using the '->' symbol, as requested. The predicates are well-defined, and the logic flows correctly from partitioning to recursive sorting and finally appending the results.

4. **Potential Issues**: There are no apparent issues in the generated code. It is syntactically correct, logically sound, and fulfills the requirements specified in the prompt.

==============addition_normal_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and aligns well with the original requirements, but there are some issues to note. The original code used `lann` and `langda` predicates, which seem to be custom or placeholders for neural network operations, while the generated code uses `nn` and directly implements the logic. The generated code correctly implements the recursive processing of digit images to form multi-digit numbers and performs addition as required. However, the original code's `langda` predicates with specific instructions (NET, LLM, FUP) are not preserved, which might be significant if those were meant to interface with external systems or have specific behaviors. The generated code's logic for `number/3` and the addition operations is correct and consistent with the described requirements. The main discrepancy is the replacement of custom predicates with standard Prolog, which might or might not be acceptable depending on the context.

==============hfw_similar_result.txt:==============
The generated code correctly defines the `almost_equal/2` predicate as required by the original code. It uses a precision of 0.0001 for comparing numbers, which matches the requirement specified in the `langda` directive. The predicate is implemented using simple Prolog syntax without any unnecessary symbols, making it clean and efficient. The implementation fits completely within the placeholder and matches the requirements from hash 5035696B. The generated code is consistent with the original code's intent and functionality, and there are no identified issues.

==============compare_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and fits the requirements, but there are a few issues to note. The code correctly implements the bubble sort algorithm by filling in the placeholders with appropriate logic. The first placeholder (FC661354) is correctly implemented to handle the single pass traversal of the bubble algorithm, using the `swap` and `hole` predicates as intended. The second placeholder (9B07F29A) correctly implements the main body of the bubble sort by performing one bubble pass and recursively sorting the remaining list. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the variable naming in the `bubble` predicate where `X2` is used but not properly connected to the rest of the logic. Additionally, the original code used `lann` for the neural network declaration, while the generated code uses `nn`, which might be a typo or a version difference. Despite these minor issues, the overall logic and structure of the generated code are correct and consistent with the original requirements.

==============hfw_rough1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. It correctly implements the parsing and evaluation of mathematical expressions from the detected symbols. The code defines a base case for single numbers and recursively parses expressions by calculating intermediate results and continuing with the remaining expression. It also implements basic arithmetic operations for calculation, maintains proper operator precedence by processing left-to-right, and uses standard Prolog arithmetic evaluation with `is`. The generated code is consistent with the original code and addresses the requirements effectively.

==============hfw_base_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits the requirements perfectly. It correctly defines the `almost_equal/2` predicate with two clauses: one for handling ground values and another for handling variables. The syntax is correct and matches the original code's requirements. The generated code is consistent with the original code's functionality and does not introduce any issues. It also fits within the placeholder as specified.
