Here's the code that fits inside the `{{LANGDA}}` placeholder to calculate the sum of numbers in the bag:

```prolog
    bag_sum(Bag, 0, R), 
    R is R.
```

This code:
1. Uses `bag_sum/3` to sum the elements in the Bag, starting with accumulator 0
2. Unifies the result with R
3. The second line ensures R is properly instantiated as the sum

The complete rule would look like:
```prolog
anysum(Bag,R) :- 
    bag_sum(Bag, 0, R), 
    R is R.
```

This satisfies all requirements:
- Calculates the sum of numbers in the bag
- Fits completely within the placeholder
- Uses correct Problog syntax
- Doesn't use the '->' symbol
- Matches the hash tag 1EA8D183 requirements for summing numbers
