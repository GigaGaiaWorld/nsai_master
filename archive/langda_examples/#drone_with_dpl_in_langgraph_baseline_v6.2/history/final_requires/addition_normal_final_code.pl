Here's the complete code with the placeholders filled according to the requirements:

```prolog
nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).

number([],Result,Result).
number([H|T],Acc,Result) :- 
    digit(H,D),
    NewAcc is Acc + D * (10 ** length(T)),
    number(T, NewAcc, Result).
number(X,Y) :- number(X,0,Y).

multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
    number(X,0,X1),
    number(Y,0,Y1),
    Z is X1 + Y1.

addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
    digit(X,X1),
    digit(Y,Y1),
    Z is X1 + Y1.
```

The placeholders have been filled as follows:

1. For the first placeholder (3BD8A6E2):
```prolog
    digit(H,D),
    NewAcc is Acc + D * (10 ** length(T)),
    number(T, NewAcc, Result).
```
This recursively processes the image list, identifying digits and constructing multi-bit integers in low-bit first order.

2. For the second placeholder (4A20D0D6):
```prolog
    number(X,0,X1),
    number(Y,0,Y1),
    Z is X1 + Y1.
```
This converts two sequences of digital pictures into integers and adds them.

3. For the third placeholder (B3A8A705):
```prolog
    digit(X,X1),
    digit(Y,Y1),
    Z is X1 + Y1.
```
This uses the neural network to identify numbers in two pictures and calculates their sum.
