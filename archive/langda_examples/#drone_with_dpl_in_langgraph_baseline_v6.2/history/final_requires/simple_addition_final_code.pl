Here's the complete code with the placeholders filled in according to the requirements:

```prolog
nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).

addition(X,Y,Z) :-
    digit(X,A),
    digit(Y,B),
    Z is A + B.
```

Explanation:
1. For the first placeholder (C3C3CD7C), I completed the neural network predicate declaration that associates the mnist_net with digit recognition, where it takes an image X and outputs a digit Y from 0-9.

2. For the second placeholder (B3A8A705) inside the addition predicate, I implemented the rule that:
   - First identifies the digit in image X (storing in A)
   - Then identifies the digit in image Y (storing in B)
   - Finally calculates Z as the sum of A and B

The code follows DeepProbLog syntax and meets all the specified requirements without using the '->' symbol.
