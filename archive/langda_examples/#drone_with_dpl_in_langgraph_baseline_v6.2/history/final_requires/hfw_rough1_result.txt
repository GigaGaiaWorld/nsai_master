The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. It correctly implements the parsing and evaluation of mathematical expressions from the detected symbols. The code defines a base case for single numbers and recursively parses expressions by calculating intermediate results and continuing with the remaining expression. It also implements basic arithmetic operations for calculation, maintains proper operator precedence by processing left-to-right, and uses standard Prolog arithmetic evaluation with `is`. The generated code is consistent with the original code and addresses the requirements effectively.
