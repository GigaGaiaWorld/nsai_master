System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with langda term that includes natural language requirements, please generate the report as required.



<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with natural language is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

nn(swap_net, [X,Y],Z,[no_swap, swap]) :: swap(X,Y,Z).
quicksort([X|Xs],Ys) :-
Supplementary logic of quicksort/2
quicksort([],[]).
partition([X|Xs],Y,[X|Ls],Rs) :-
swap(X,Y,swap), partition(Xs,Y,Ls,Rs).
partition([X|Xs],Y,Ls,[X|Rs]) :-
swap(X,Y,no_swap), partition(Xs,Y,Ls,Rs).
partition([],Y,[],[]).
append([],Ys,Ys).
append([X|Xs],Ys,[X|Zs]) :- append(Xs,Ys,Zs).
forth_sort(L,L2) :- quicksort(L,L2).

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could replace the langda term and nothing more. 

Please generate the complete new code.
