System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with langda term that includes natural language requirements, please generate the report as required.



<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with natural language is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

nn(rnn,[Text],Embedding) :: rnn(Text,Embedding).
nn(nn_permute, [X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5]) :: net1(X,Y).
nn(nn_op1, [X],Y, [plus,minus,times,div]) :: net2(X,Y).
nn(nn_swap, [X],Y, [no_swap,swap]) :: net3(X,Y).
nn(nn_op2, [X],Y, [plus,minus,times,div]) :: net4(X,Y).
permute(0,A,B,C,A,B,C).
permute(1,A,B,C,A,C,B).
permute(2,A,B,C,B,A,C).
permute(3,A,B,C,B,C,A).
permute(4,A,B,C,C,A,B).
permute(5,A,B,C,C,B,A).
swap(no_swap,X,Y,X,Y).
swap(swap,X,Y,Y,X).
operator(plus,X,Y,Z) :- Z is X+Y.
operator(minus,X,Y,Z) :- Z is X-Y.
operator(times,X,Y,Z) :- Z is X*Y.
operator(div,X,Y,Z) :- Y > 0, 0 =:= X mod Y,Z is X//Y.
wap(Text,X1,X2,X3,Out) :-
Add the smallest two numbers and then subtract the largest

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could replace the langda term and nothing more. 

Please generate the complete new code.
