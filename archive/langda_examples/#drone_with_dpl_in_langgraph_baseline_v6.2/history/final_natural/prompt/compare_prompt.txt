System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with langda term that includes natural language requirements, please generate the report as required.



<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with natural language is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 


nn(swap_net,[X,Y],Z,[no_swap, swap])
 :: swap(X,Y,Z).
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):- 
Single pass traversal process of the bubble algorithm
bubblesort([],L,L).
bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :-
bubble(L,L2,X),
bubblesort(L2,[X|L3],Sorted).
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could replace the langda term and nothing more. 

Please generate the complete new code.
