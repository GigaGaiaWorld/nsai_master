System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with langda term that includes natural language requirements, please generate the report as required.



<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with natural language is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

% UAV properties
initial_charge ~ normal(90, 5).
charge_cost ~ normal(-0.1, 0.2).
weight ~ normal(0.2, 0.1).
% Weather conditions
1/10::fog; 9/10::clear.
stay away from the bomb
% Visual line of sight
vlos(X) :-
fog, distance(X, operator) < 50;
clear, distance(X, operator) < 100;
clear, over(X, bay), distance(X, operator) < 400.
% Sufficient charge to return to operator
can_return(X) :-
B is initial_charge, O is charge_cost,
D is distance(X, operator), 0 < B + (2 * O * D).
% Permits related to local features
permits(X) :-
distance(X, service) < 15; distance(X, primary) < 15;
distance(X, secondary) < 10; distance(X, tertiary) < 5;
distance(X, crossing) < 5; distance(X, rail) < 5;
over(X, park).
% Definition of a valid mission
landscape(X) :-
{{LANGDA}}

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could replace the langda term and nothing more. 

Please generate the complete new code.
