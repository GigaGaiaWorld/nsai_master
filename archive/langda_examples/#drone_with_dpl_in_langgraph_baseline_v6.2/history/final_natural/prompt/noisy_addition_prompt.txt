System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with langda term that includes natural language requirements, please generate the report as required.



<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with natural language is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).
t(0.1) :: noisy.
1/19::uniform(X,Y,0);1/19::uniform(X,Y,1);1/19::uniform(X,Y,2);1/19::uniform(X,Y,3);1/19::uniform(X,Y,4);1/19::uniform(X,Y,5);1/19::uniform(X,Y,6);1/19::uniform(X,Y,7);1/19::uniform(X,Y,8);1/19::uniform(X,Y,9);1/19::uniform(X,Y,10);1/19::uniform(X,Y,11);1/19::uniform(X,Y,12);1/19::uniform(X,Y,13);1/19::uniform(X,Y,14);1/19::uniform(X,Y,15);1/19::uniform(X,Y,16);1/19::uniform(X,Y,17);1/19::uniform(X,Y,18).
define addition_noisy/3

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could replace the langda term and nothing more. 

Please generate the complete new code.
