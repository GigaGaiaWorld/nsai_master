System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with langda term that includes natural language requirements, please generate the report as required.



<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with natural language is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 


nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
 :: digit(X,Y).
number([],Result,Result).
number([H|T],Acc,Result) :- 
Recursively process the image list: identify the digits one by one and construct the corresponding multi-bit integers in low-bit first order.
number(X,Y) :- number(X,0,Y).
multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
Convert two sets of sequences consisting of digital pictures into integers and add them together to get the numerical result.
addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
Use a neural network to identify the numbers in two pictures and then calculate their sum.

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could replace the langda term and nothing more. 

Please generate the complete new code.
