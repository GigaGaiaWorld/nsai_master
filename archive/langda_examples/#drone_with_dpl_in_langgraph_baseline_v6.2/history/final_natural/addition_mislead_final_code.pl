Here's the complete DeepProbLog code that implements the rules as described:

```prolog
nn(mnist_net, [X], Y, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).

number([], Result, Result).
number([H|T], Acc, Result) :- 
    digit(H, D),
    NewAcc is Acc + D * (10 ** length(T)),
    number(T, NewAcc, Result).
number(X, Y) :- number(X, 0, Y).

multi_addition(X, Y, Z) :-
    number(X, X1),
    number(Y, Y1),
    Z is X1 + Y1.

addition(X1, X2, Z) :-
    digit(X1, D1),
    digit(X2, D2),
    Z is D1 + D2.
```

This code:
1. Defines the neural network predicate for digit recognition
2. Implements the `number/3` and `number/2` predicates to convert lists of digit images to numbers
3. Provides `multi_addition/3` for adding two multi-digit numbers represented as image lists
4. Implements `addition/3` for adding two single-digit numbers represented as images

The code follows the requirements by:
- Processing digits recursively in low-bit first order
- Converting image sequences to integers before addition
- Using X1 and X2 as terms in the addition predicate
- Avoiding the use of '->' symbols
