The generated code is a valid replacement for the original code. It maintains all the original functionality while replacing the `langda` term with a proper implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. The generated code correctly implements the neural network predicate `swap_net` for predicting swap actions and preserves the `hole` predicate for handling element swapping based on the swap decision. The bubble sort algorithm is correctly implemented with base and recursive cases, and the main sorting predicate `bubblesort` is consistent with the original code. The interface predicate `forth_sort` is also correctly included to initiate the sorting process. The code follows standard Prolog/ProbLog syntax and does not use the '->' symbol as requested. Overall, the generated code is correct, consistent with the original code, and meets all the specified requirements.
