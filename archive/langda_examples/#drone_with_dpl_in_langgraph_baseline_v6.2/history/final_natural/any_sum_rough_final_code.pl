Here's the complete DeepProblog code that replaces the langda term while capturing all the information from the original rule set:

```prolog
nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).
addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,X2), digit(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.
anysum(Bag,R) :- bag_sum(Bag,0,R).

bag_sum([],Acc,Acc).
bag_sum([X|Xs],Acc,R) :- digit(X,N), NewAcc is Acc + N, bag_sum(Xs,NewAcc,R).
```

The code includes:
1. The original neural network predicate for digit recognition
2. The addition predicate that sums two recognized digits
3. A complete implementation of the anysum predicate that calculates the sum of numbers in a bag, using a helper predicate bag_sum/3 to perform the recursive summation with an accumulator
