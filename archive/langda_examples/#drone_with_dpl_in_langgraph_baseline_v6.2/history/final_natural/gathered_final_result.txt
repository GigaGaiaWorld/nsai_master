==============choose_inside_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and maintains the functionality of the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Neural Network Declarations**: The generated code correctly preserves the original neural network declarations for `neural1` and `neural2`, which are used to compute the result and carry, respectively.

2. **Slot Predicate**: The `slot` predicate is correctly defined to combine results from both neural networks, just like in the original code.

3. **Add Predicate**: The `add` predicate is completed with proper recursive logic. The base case (`add([],[],C,C,[])`) is correctly handled, and the recursive case uses the `slot` predicate to compute individual digit additions and propagate the carry.

4. **Functionality**: The generated code correctly implements the addition of numbers represented as lists of digits, with proper carry propagation through recursive calls.

5. **Consistency**: The generated code is consistent with the original code's intent and functionality. It avoids using the '->' symbol as required and maintains all original features.

6. **Potential Issues**: There are no apparent issues in the generated code. It correctly replaces the `langda` terms and maintains all original functionality.

In conclusion, the generated code is valid and meets all the requirements specified.

==============choose_outside_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and fits the requirements, but there are a few issues to note. First, the generated code correctly maintains the neural network declarations for `neural1` and `neural2` and keeps the `slot` predicate that combines the results from both networks. It also implements the complete `add/5` predicate with recursive logic for multi-digit addition, handling both the base case (empty lists) and the recursive case for lists with heads and tails. However, there is a discrepancy in the arity of the `add` predicate. The original code includes a version of `add/4` and a commented-out version of `add/5`, while the generated code only includes `add/5`. Additionally, the original code has a line `add(L1,L2,C,[Carry|Res]) :- add(L1,L2,C,Carry,Res).` which is not present in the generated code. Despite these minor inconsistencies, the generated code should properly handle the addition of numbers represented as lists of digits.

==============choose_simple_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and maintains the functionality of the original code. It correctly replaces the langda terms with proper tensor operations in the `slot` predicate, which includes one-hot encoding and concatenation of tensors. The neural network declarations (`neural1` and `neural2`) are kept intact, and the `add` predicates for list processing remain unchanged. The variable naming is consistent with the original code, and the functionality appears to be preserved. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the `add` predicate: the original code has a comment block that defines a different version of the `result` and `carry` predicates for single inputs, which is not present in the generated code. This omission does not affect the core functionality but could be considered a slight deviation from the original code's structure. Overall, the generated code is valid and meets the requirements.

==============simple_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and improved version of the original code. It correctly maintains the neural network declaration for digit recognition using the 'nn' predicate, which is the standard way to define neural networks in DeepProblog. The addition rule is properly implemented by first identifying the digits in images X and Y, then calculating their sum. This implementation is more straightforward and cleaner than the original, which used the non-standard 'langda' term. The generated code adheres to Problog syntax and style, and it fulfills all the requirements specified in the original code while avoiding the use of the '->' symbol.

==============any_sum_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and improves upon the original code by providing a concrete implementation for the anysum predicate, which was previously using a placeholder langda term. The generated code maintains the original digit recognition neural network predicate and the addition predicate unchanged, ensuring consistency with the original functionality. The new implementation of anysum uses a helper predicate bag_sum/3 to recursively calculate the sum of digits in a bag, which is a correct and efficient approach. However, there is a minor inconsistency: the original anysum/2 predicate's first argument was named 'Bag', suggesting it should work with a bag (multiset) of numbers, but the generated bag_sum/3 implementation processes a list, not a bag. In Prolog, bags and lists are different structures, and the generated code does not handle potential duplicate elements or unordered collections as a bag would imply. Despite this, the code is logically correct for summing elements of a list of digit images.

==============poker_rough3_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid extension of the original code. It correctly implements the supplementary logic for the `game/3` predicate, maintaining consistency with the original code's structure and functionality. The generated code:

1. Correctly uses the `house_rank/1` predicate to determine the house card.
2. Appropriately calls the `cards/4` predicate to get the cards for both the player ('own') and the opponent.
3. Uses the `best_hand_rank/2` predicate to determine the best hand rank for both sets of cards.
4. Correctly compares the ranks using the `outcome/3` predicate to determine the game outcome.

The code follows Problog syntax and does not use the '->' symbol as requested. It maintains all original functionality and adds the necessary logic to complete the `game/3` predicate. There are no syntax errors or logical inconsistencies in the generated code.

==============hfw_fine1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid replacement for the original code. It maintains all the original functionality while correctly implementing the `almost_equal/2` predicate as specified. The analysis is as follows:

1. **Neural Network Declarations**: The generated code correctly preserves the original neural network declarations for `detect_number` and `detect_operator`.

2. **Detect All Predicate**: The `detect_all` predicate is implemented exactly as in the original code, correctly processing lists of numbers and operators.

3. **Almost Equal Predicate**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly implemented with two clauses:
   - The first clause checks if Y is bound (nonvar) and verifies if the absolute difference between X and Y is less than 0.0001.
   - The second clause handles the case where Y is unbound (var) and assigns Y the float value of X.
   This matches the specified behavior in the original code's langda term.

4. **Expression and Parse Predicates**: All parsing rules for arithmetic expressions are preserved exactly as in the original code, including the special case for subtraction.

5. **Avoidance of '->' Symbol**: The generated code does not use the '->' symbol, adhering to the requirement.

6. **Consistency and Correctness**: The generated code is consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. There are no identified issues or deviations from the original requirements.

==============choose_example_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and fits the requirements for implementing bit-by-bit addition of two numbers. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The neural predicate declarations (neural1 and neural2) are correctly defined to predict the result digit (0-9) and carry (0-1) respectively.
   - The `slot/5` predicate correctly combines both neural network predictions.
   - The recursive `add_numbers/4` predicate properly handles the digit-by-digit addition with carry propagation.
   - The base cases correctly handle the termination condition, including the optional final carry.

2. **Consistency with Original Code**:
   - The neural network declarations match exactly with the original code.
   - The `slot/5` predicate is identical to the original.
   - The generated code adds the missing recursive addition logic that was only described in comments in the original code.

3. **Improvements**:
   - The generated code completes the implementation by providing the actual addition logic that was missing in the original code.
   - It maintains the same reverse-digit-order representation as specified in the requirements.
   - The example query matches exactly with the described use case (347 + 568).

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - None significant. The code correctly implements the described functionality.
   - The only minor note is that the result digits are in reverse order (least significant digit first), which is actually correct for this kind of bit-by-bit processing but might be confusing if not properly documented.

==============addition_mislead_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and improved version of the original code. It correctly implements the functionality described in the original code while fixing several issues and providing clearer, more standard Prolog syntax. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Neural Network Declaration**: 
   - Original used `lann` which is non-standard
   - Generated code correctly uses `nn` which is the standard DeepProbLog predicate for neural networks
   - Maintains the same input/output structure

2. **number/3 and number/2 predicates**:
   - Original had incomplete implementation with `langda` calls
   - Generated code provides a complete, recursive implementation that:
     * Correctly processes digit images
     * Accumulates the number in low-bit first order
     * Uses proper Prolog arithmetic

3. **Addition Predicates**:
   - `multi_addition/3`:
     * Original had vague `langda` call
     * Generated version properly converts image lists to numbers before adding
   - `addition/3`:
     * Original suggested using terms X1/X2 but didn't implement
     * Generated version implements this correctly for single digits

4. **General Improvements**:
   - Removed all `langda` pseudo-code
   - Uses standard Prolog syntax throughout
   - Proper arithmetic operations
   - Clear predicate naming and structure

5. **Requirements Met**:
   - Processes digits recursively in low-bit first order
   - Converts image sequences to integers
   - Uses X1/X2 as terms in addition
   - No '->' symbols used

The only minor discrepancy is that the generated code doesn't include the original's comment annotations, but this doesn't affect functionality.

==============choose_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and correct implementation of bit-by-bit addition of two numbers in DeepProbLog. It maintains the core functionality of the original code while being more concise. The analysis reveals the following points:

1. **Correctness**: 
   - The neural network declarations (neural1 and neural2) are correctly defined with the same input/output specifications as the original.
   - The 'slot' predicate correctly combines both neural networks to perform the addition operation.
   - The code properly handles the carry propagation and result calculation.

2. **Consistency with Original Code**:
   - The generated code preserves all the essential components of the original implementation.
   - It removes the commented-out alternative implementations and one-hot encoding sections, which were not part of the core requirements.
   - The functionality remains identical to the original working code.

3. **Improvements**:
   - The generated code is more focused and cleaner by removing unnecessary commented code.
   - It maintains proper DeepProbLog syntax conventions.

4. **Identified Issues**:
   - No issues were found in the generated code. It correctly implements the required functionality without any syntax or logical errors.

The code is a valid DeepProbLog implementation that meets all specified requirements.

==============compare_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid replacement for the original code. It maintains all the original functionality while replacing the `langda` term with a proper implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. The generated code correctly implements the neural network predicate `swap_net` for predicting swap actions and preserves the `hole` predicate for handling element swapping based on the swap decision. The bubble sort algorithm is correctly implemented with base and recursive cases, and the main sorting predicate `bubblesort` is consistent with the original code. The interface predicate `forth_sort` is also correctly included to initiate the sorting process. The code follows standard Prolog/ProbLog syntax and does not use the '->' symbol as requested. Overall, the generated code is correct, consistent with the original code, and meets all the specified requirements.

==============noisy_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code's intent, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed. The implementation of `addition_noisy/3` correctly uses the `digit/2` predicate to recognize digits from images X and Y, and it properly incorporates the `noisy` probabilistic fact with a 0.1 probability. The use of `uniform/3` to add a random number between 0-18 when noisy is also correct, and the modulo 19 operation ensures the result stays within the desired range. However, there is a syntax error in the generated code: the disjunction (`;`) in the `addition_noisy/3` predicate is not properly closed with parentheses, which would cause a compilation error. Additionally, the `uniform/3` predicate is used correctly but it's worth noting that the variables in `uniform(_, _, C)` are anonymous, which is fine but might be clearer with meaningful variable names. Overall, the logic is sound but the syntax needs correction.

==============noisy_static_addition_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid but has some issues when compared to the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Probabilistic Fact Syntax**: The change from `t(0.1) :: noisy` to `0.1::noisy` is correct and follows standard ProbLog syntax. This is a valid improvement.

2. **Uniform Distribution Implementation**: The generated code implements the uniform distribution over 0-18 using explicit probabilities, which is correct in principle. However, the original code uses a `langda` predicate with an LLM annotation, which suggests a more dynamic or external way of defining the distribution. The generated code's approach is valid but may not fully capture the original intent if the `langda` predicate had additional functionality.

3. **Rule Consistency**: The rules for `addition_noisy` and `addition` are kept exactly as specified in the original code, which is correct.

4. **Missing `langda` Predicate**: The generated code omits the `langda` predicate entirely, replacing it with a direct implementation. This could be an issue if the `langda` predicate was meant to be used elsewhere in the program or had additional functionalities not shown in the original snippet.

5. **Probability Values**: The uniform distribution in the generated code correctly assigns 1/19 probability to each value from 0 to 18, which matches the original requirement.

In summary, the generated code is functionally valid and mostly consistent with the original code, but it lacks the `langda` predicate, which might be significant depending on the broader context. If the `langda` predicate was purely for defining the uniform distribution, then the generated code is valid. Otherwise, it might be incomplete.

==============promis_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and maintains the core functionality of the original code. However, there are a few discrepancies and issues to note:

1. **Missing `langda` Fact**: The original code includes a fact `langda(LLM:\

==============poker_rough1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is valid and fits the requirements. It introduces two new predicates, `hand(Cards,pair(R))` and `hand(Cards,threeofakind(R))`, which are consistent with the style and logic of the original code. The implementation uses `select/3` to find and remove matching cards, then checks for additional cards of the same rank, which is a correct and efficient way to implement these predicates. The generated code does not use the '->' symbol as requested and maintains the declarative style of Prolog. The new predicates also align with the existing `hand_rank/2` facts in the original code, which include ranks for pairs and three-of-a-kind hands. Overall, the generated code is correct, consistent, and meets all specified requirements.

==============quicksort_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and complete implementation of the original requirements. It successfully replaces the langda term with a proper recursive implementation of quicksort while maintaining all the original functionality. The analysis reveals the following points:

1. **Correctness**: The quicksort implementation is now complete with proper recursive calls to partition the list and sort the sublists. The base case for empty lists is correctly maintained.

2. **Consistency**: All original predicates (swap, partition, append, forth_sort) are preserved with their exact original functionality. The neural network declaration for swap_net remains unchanged.

3. **Improvements**: The generated code actually improves upon the original by providing the missing implementation of quicksort that was previously just a placeholder (langda term).

4. **Syntax**: The code follows standard Prolog syntax without using the '->' symbol as requested.

5. **Functionality**: The code maintains the same sorting behavior as implied by the original code structure, but now with a complete implementation.

No issues were identified in the generated code. It correctly implements all required functionality while staying true to the original code's structure and purpose.

==============hfw_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely consistent with the original code and maintains all the original functionality. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The neural network declarations (`net1` and `net2`) are identical to the original.
   - The `detect_all/2` predicate is correctly implemented to process sequences of numbers and operators.
   - The `almost_equal/2` predicate has been modified to use `0.0001` instead of `0.` for floating-point comparison, which is a practical improvement.
   - The `expression/2` and `parse/2` predicates are correctly implemented to evaluate mathematical expressions, handling all basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) as in the original.

2. **Consistency**:
   - The structure and logic of the original code are preserved.
   - Variable names and predicate names remain unchanged.
   - The special case for subtraction (converting it to addition with a negative number) is correctly maintained.

3. **Identified Issues**:
   - There are no significant issues. The generated code is a faithful reproduction of the original with a minor improvement in the floating-point comparison threshold.

4. **Functionality**:
   - The code correctly implements a system that uses neural networks to detect numbers and operators, processes sequences of these, and evaluates mathematical expressions.
   - The handling of division includes a check for division by zero (`N2 \\== 0`), which is correct.

Overall, the generated code is valid and meets all the requirements.

==============any_sum_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid and correct implementation of the original requirements. It successfully replaces the langda terms with proper Prolog-style rules while maintaining the functionality described in the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Neural Network Predicate**: The `digit/2` predicate remains unchanged from the original, correctly representing the MNIST digit classifier.

2. **Addition Rule**: The `addition/3` rule is identical to the original and correctly sums two digits identified by the neural network.

3. **Anysum Implementation**: The generated code properly implements the `anysum/2` predicate using a helper predicate `bag_sum/3` with accumulator style recursion. This is a correct and efficient way to sum a list of numbers in Prolog.

4. **Consistency**: The generated code maintains all the functionality of the original while improving it by providing a concrete implementation for the `anysum` predicate that was previously just a placeholder.

5. **Requirements Met**: The code avoids using the `->` symbol as requested and correctly handles list summation through recursion and accumulation.

6. **Correctness**: The logic is sound and would correctly sum all digit values in a list after they're classified by the neural network.

==============wap_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid implementation that replaces the `langda` term with a complete DeepProbLog implementation. It maintains all the original neural network declarations and helper predicates (`permute`, `swap`, `operator`). The `wap/5` predicate is correctly implemented to: 1) get the text embedding using RNN, 2) predict permutation, operations, and swap using neural networks, 3) apply the permutation and swap operations, and 4) perform the arithmetic operations. The constraint to add the two smallest numbers and subtract the largest is enforced through ordering constraints (A ≤ B1 ≤ C1). The code is consistent with the original requirements and correctly implements the described functionality.

==============poker_rough2_result.txt:==============
The generated code is largely valid and maintains the functionality of the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**: The generated code correctly replicates the logic of the original code, including the probabilistic definitions, neural network declarations, and game rules. All predicates and their implementations are preserved accurately.

2. **Consistency**: The generated code is consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. The replacement of `{{LANGDA}}` terms has been handled appropriately, and the supplementary logic comments have been removed without affecting functionality.

3. **Identified Issues**: 
   - The note about typos in the original code (e.g., 'queen' spelled consistently) is misleading since there are no actual typos in the original code regarding 'queen' or 'threeofakind'.
   - The generated code does not include the comment `langda(\

==============promis_fine_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and aligns well with the original requirements. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**:
   - The bomb constraint is correctly implemented as a Prolog constraint `:- distance(X, bomb) < 100.`, which effectively replaces the original `langda` predicate.
   - The `landscape` predicate is correctly translated into proper Prolog syntax with two alternatives, matching the original conditions.
   - All other rules (UAV properties, weather conditions, visual line of sight, can_return, and permits) are maintained exactly as specified.

2. **Consistency with Original Code**:
   - The generated code maintains the same logical structure and requirements as the original code.
   - The translation of the `langda` terms into standard Prolog syntax is consistent with the original intent.

3. **Identified Issues**:
   - The generated code does not explicitly handle the `FUP` parameter from the original `langda` predicate, but since it was not used in any rules, this omission does not affect functionality.
   - The weight condition in the `landscape` predicate (`weight < 0.3`) is a reasonable interpretation of 'light weight,' but the original code did not specify a threshold, so this might need adjustment based on the exact requirements.

4. **Overall Validity**:
   - The generated code is valid and fits the requirements, as it correctly implements all the original logic without introducing errors.

==============quicksort_superrough_result.txt:==============
The generated code has several issues when compared to the original code and requirements. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Neural Predicate Syntax**: The original code uses `::` for the neural predicate definition, which is the correct DeepProbLog syntax for defining neural predicates. The generated code incorrectly uses `:-`, which is standard Prolog syntax but not valid for DeepProbLog neural predicates.

2. **Missing Prompt**: The original code includes a prompt directive (`prompt(LLM:\

==============addition_normal_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and improves upon the original code by replacing the langda terms with proper DeepProbLog implementations. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Digit Recognition**:
   - Correctly replaces the original lann/4 with nn/4 for digit recognition
   - Maintains the same network name and output classes

2. **Number Construction**:
   - Implements the recursive number construction properly
   - Handles low-bit first order correctly using 10^length(T)
   - Fixes the original's incomplete recursive rule

3. **Addition Operations**:
   - multi_addition/3 correctly handles multi-digit addition
   - addition/3 correctly handles single-digit addition
   - Both properly convert images to numbers before adding

4. **Improvements**:
   - Removes all langda terms and implements actual logic
   - Maintains all required functionality
   - Uses proper Prolog arithmetic

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The original had a FUP:\

==============hfw_similar_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and maintains the functionality of the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Correctness**: The generated code correctly implements the `almost_equal/2` predicate with a precision of 0.0001, replacing the `langda` term from the original code. The rest of the predicates (`detect_number`, `detect_operator`, `detect_all`, `expression`, and `parse`) are identical to the original and correctly handle the arithmetic operations.

2. **Consistency**: The generated code is consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. The only difference is the replacement of the `langda` term with a direct implementation of `almost_equal/2`, which is exactly what was required.

3. **Identified Issues**: There are no significant issues in the generated code. However, it's worth noting that the `parse` predicate for subtraction (`parse([N1,-|T], R)`) is implemented as a combination of multiplication and addition (i.e., `parse([-1,*|T],R2)` followed by `almost_equal(N1+R2,R)`). While this is consistent with the original code, it might be less intuitive than directly handling subtraction.

4. **Functionality**: The generated code correctly processes sequences of images to detect numbers and operators, parses them into arithmetic expressions, and evaluates them with the specified precision for floating-point comparisons.

Overall, the generated code is valid and meets the requirements specified in the original code.

==============compare_rough_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and maintains the functionality described in the original code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Neural Network Declaration**: 
   - The generated code correctly replaces `lann` with `nn` for the neural network declaration, which is the proper syntax in DeepProbLog.
   - The parameters and structure remain identical to the original.

2. **hole/4 Predicate**:
   - The implementation is exactly the same as in the original code, correctly handling both swap and no_swap cases.

3. **bubble/3 Predicate**:
   - The base case `bubble([X], [], X)` is correctly preserved.
   - The recursive case properly implements the single pass traversal by using the `hole/4` predicate, replacing the original `langda` term with actual logic.

4. **bubblesort/3 Predicate**:
   - The base case `bubblesort([], L, L)` is correctly preserved.
   - The recursive case now properly implements the bubble sort algorithm by combining `bubble` and recursive `bubblesort` calls, replacing the original `langda` term.

5. **forth_sort/2 Predicate**:
   - This interface predicate remains unchanged and correctly calls `bubblesort` with an empty accumulator.

**Consistency with Original Code**:
- The generated code maintains all the functionality of the original while properly replacing the placeholder `langda` terms with actual Prolog logic.
- The neural network integration remains intact.

**Identified Issues**:
- There are no significant issues. The code is syntactically correct and logically sound for implementing bubble sort with probabilistic swapping.

**Minor Note**:
- The variable naming in the `bubble` predicate could be slightly improved for clarity (e.g., `X2` could be named more descriptively), but this doesn't affect validity.


==============hfw_rough1_result.txt:==============
The generated code is mostly valid and fits the requirements, but there are a few points to consider. The generated code correctly defines the neural networks for number and operator detection (net1 and net2) and implements the detect_all predicate to process a sequence of images. It also includes the almost_equal predicate for floating point comparison, which is consistent with the original code. The parse and calculate predicates are correctly implemented to evaluate mathematical expressions step by step, and the main expression predicate ties everything together as required. However, the generated code does not include the langda predicate from the original code, which provides a description of the neural network and LLM functionality. If this was an intentional omission, the generated code is valid; otherwise, it is missing a component from the original code. Additionally, the generated code does not use the '->' symbol, as requested.

==============hfw_base_result.txt:==============
The generated code is a valid translation of the original code. It successfully replaces the langda terms while maintaining all the functionality from the original rule set. The neural network declarations (net1 and net2) are preserved, as are the detect_all and almost_equal predicates. The expression and parse predicates are also correctly implemented, including all the original arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction via multiplication by -1, multiplication, and division with zero check). The code follows standard Prolog/ProbLog syntax and avoids using the '->' symbol as requested. There are no identified issues with the generated code.
