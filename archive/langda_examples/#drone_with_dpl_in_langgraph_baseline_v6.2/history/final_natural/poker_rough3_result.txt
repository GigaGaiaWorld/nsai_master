The generated code is a valid extension of the original code. It correctly implements the supplementary logic for the `game/3` predicate, maintaining consistency with the original code's structure and functionality. The generated code:

1. Correctly uses the `house_rank/1` predicate to determine the house card.
2. Appropriately calls the `cards/4` predicate to get the cards for both the player ('own') and the opponent.
3. Uses the `best_hand_rank/2` predicate to determine the best hand rank for both sets of cards.
4. Correctly compares the ranks using the `outcome/3` predicate to determine the game outcome.

The code follows Problog syntax and does not use the '->' symbol as requested. It maintains all original functionality and adds the necessary logic to complete the `game/3` predicate. There are no syntax errors or logical inconsistencies in the generated code.
