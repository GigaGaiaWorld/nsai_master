The generated code is a valid replacement for the original code. It maintains all the original functionality while correctly implementing the `almost_equal/2` predicate as specified. The analysis is as follows:

1. **Neural Network Declarations**: The generated code correctly preserves the original neural network declarations for `detect_number` and `detect_operator`.

2. **Detect All Predicate**: The `detect_all` predicate is implemented exactly as in the original code, correctly processing lists of numbers and operators.

3. **Almost Equal Predicate**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly implemented with two clauses:
   - The first clause checks if Y is bound (nonvar) and verifies if the absolute difference between X and Y is less than 0.0001.
   - The second clause handles the case where Y is unbound (var) and assigns Y the float value of X.
   This matches the specified behavior in the original code's langda term.

4. **Expression and Parse Predicates**: All parsing rules for arithmetic expressions are preserved exactly as in the original code, including the special case for subtraction.

5. **Avoidance of '->' Symbol**: The generated code does not use the '->' symbol, adhering to the requirement.

6. **Consistency and Correctness**: The generated code is consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. There are no identified issues or deviations from the original requirements.
