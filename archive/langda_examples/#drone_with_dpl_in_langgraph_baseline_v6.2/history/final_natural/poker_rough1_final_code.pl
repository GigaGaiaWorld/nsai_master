Here's the complete code that replaces the `{{LANGDA}}` term, maintaining all the logic and requirements:

```prolog
hand(Cards,pair(R)) :-
    select(card(R),Cards,Rest),
    member(card(R),Rest).
hand(Cards,threeofakind(R)) :-
    select(card(R),Cards,Rest1),
    select(card(R),Rest1,Rest2),
    member(card(R),Rest2).
```

This code defines two additional hand types:
1. `pair(R)` - when there are two cards of the same rank R in the hand
2. `threeofakind(R)` - when there are three cards of the same rank R in the hand

The implementation uses `select/3` to find and remove matching cards, then checks if there are additional cards of the same rank in the remaining cards. This matches the style and logic of the surrounding code and doesn't use the '->' symbol as requested.
