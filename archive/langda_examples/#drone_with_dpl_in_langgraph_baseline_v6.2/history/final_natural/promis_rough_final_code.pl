Based on the given ruleset and requirements, here's the complete Problog code that replaces the `{{LANGDA}}` term while maintaining all the original functionality:

```prolog
% UAV properties
initial_charge ~ normal(90, 5).
charge_cost ~ normal(-0.1, 0.2).
weight ~ normal(0.2, 0.1).
% Weather conditions
1/10::fog; 9/10::clear.
% Visual line of sight
vlos(X) :-
    fog, distance(X, operator) < 50;
    clear, distance(X, operator) < 100;
    clear, over(X, bay), distance(X, operator) < 400.
% Sufficient charge to return to operator
can_return(X) :-
    B is initial_charge, O is charge_cost,
    D is distance(X, operator), 0 < B + (2 * O * D).
% Permits related to local features
permits(X) :-
    distance(X, service) < 15; distance(X, primary) < 15;
    distance(X, secondary) < 10; distance(X, tertiary) < 5;
    distance(X, crossing) < 5; distance(X, rail) < 5;
    over(X, park).
% Definition of a valid mission
landscape(X) :-
    vlos(X),
    can_return(X),
    permits(X).
```

The `{{LANGDA}}` term has been replaced with the conjunction of conditions that define a valid mission: `vlos(X), can_return(X), permits(X).` This means for a location X to be considered valid for the mission landscape, it must satisfy all three conditions: be within visual line of sight, have sufficient charge to return, and have the necessary permits.
