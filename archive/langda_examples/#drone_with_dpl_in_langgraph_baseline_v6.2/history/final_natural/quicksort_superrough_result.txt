The generated code has several issues when compared to the original code and requirements. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Neural Predicate Syntax**: The original code uses `::` for the neural predicate definition, which is the correct DeepProbLog syntax for defining neural predicates. The generated code incorrectly uses `:-`, which is standard Prolog syntax but not valid for DeepProbLog neural predicates.

2. **Missing Prompt**: The original code includes a prompt directive (`prompt(LLM:\
