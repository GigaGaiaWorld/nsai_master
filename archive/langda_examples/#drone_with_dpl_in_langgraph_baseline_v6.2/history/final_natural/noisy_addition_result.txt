The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code's intent, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed. The implementation of `addition_noisy/3` correctly uses the `digit/2` predicate to recognize digits from images X and Y, and it properly incorporates the `noisy` probabilistic fact with a 0.1 probability. The use of `uniform/3` to add a random number between 0-18 when noisy is also correct, and the modulo 19 operation ensures the result stays within the desired range. However, there is a syntax error in the generated code: the disjunction (`;`) in the `addition_noisy/3` predicate is not properly closed with parentheses, which would cause a compilation error. Additionally, the `uniform/3` predicate is used correctly but it's worth noting that the variables in `uniform(_, _, C)` are anonymous, which is fine but might be clearer with meaningful variable names. Overall, the logic is sound but the syntax needs correction.
