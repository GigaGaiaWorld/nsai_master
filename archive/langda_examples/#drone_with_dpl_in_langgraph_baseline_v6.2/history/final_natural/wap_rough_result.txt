The generated code is a valid implementation that replaces the `langda` term with a complete DeepProbLog implementation. It maintains all the original neural network declarations and helper predicates (`permute`, `swap`, `operator`). The `wap/5` predicate is correctly implemented to: 1) get the text embedding using RNN, 2) predict permutation, operations, and swap using neural networks, 3) apply the permutation and swap operations, and 4) perform the arithmetic operations. The constraint to add the two smallest numbers and subtract the largest is enforced through ordering constraints (A ≤ B1 ≤ C1). The code is consistent with the original requirements and correctly implements the described functionality.
