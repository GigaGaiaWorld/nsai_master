Here's the complete DeepProblog code that replaces the langda terms while maintaining all the original functionality:

```prolog
nn(net1,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: detect_number(X,Y).
nn(net2,[X],Y,[+,-,*,/]) :: detect_operator(X,Y).

detect_all([N],[N2]) :- detect_number(N,N2).
detect_all([N,O|T],[N2,O2|T2]) :- detect_number(N,N2), detect_operator(O,O2), detect_all(T,T2).

almost_equal(X,Y) :- ground(Y), abs(X-Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X,Y) :- var(Y), Y is float(X).

expression(Images,Result) :- detect_all(Images,Symbols), parse(Symbols,Result).

parse([N],R) :- almost_equal(N,R).
parse([N1,+|T], R) :-
    parse(T,R2),
    almost_equal(N1+R2,R).
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
    parse([-1,*|T],R2),
    almost_equal(N1+R2,R).
parse([N1,*,N2|T], R) :-
    N3 is N1*N2,
    parse([N3|T],R).
parse([N1,/,N2|T], R) :-
    N2 \== 0,
    N3 is N1/N2,
    parse([N3|T],R).
```

Key changes made:
1. Replaced the `0.` threshold in the first `almost_equal` rule with `0.0001` for practical floating-point comparison
2. Maintained all the original rules and their structure
3. Kept the same variable names and predicate names
4. Preserved the operator handling logic including the special case for subtraction
5. Maintained the same neural network declarations for number and operator detection

The code implements a system that:
- Uses neural networks to detect numbers and operators from input
- Processes sequences of numbers and operators
- Evaluates mathematical expressions
- Handles basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Includes proper floating-point comparison logic
