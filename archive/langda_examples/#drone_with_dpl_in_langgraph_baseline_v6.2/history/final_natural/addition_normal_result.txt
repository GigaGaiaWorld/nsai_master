The generated code is mostly valid and improves upon the original code by replacing the langda terms with proper DeepProbLog implementations. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Digit Recognition**:
   - Correctly replaces the original lann/4 with nn/4 for digit recognition
   - Maintains the same network name and output classes

2. **Number Construction**:
   - Implements the recursive number construction properly
   - Handles low-bit first order correctly using 10^length(T)
   - Fixes the original's incomplete recursive rule

3. **Addition Operations**:
   - multi_addition/3 correctly handles multi-digit addition
   - addition/3 correctly handles single-digit addition
   - Both properly convert images to numbers before adding

4. **Improvements**:
   - Removes all langda terms and implements actual logic
   - Maintains all required functionality
   - Uses proper Prolog arithmetic

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The original had a FUP:\
