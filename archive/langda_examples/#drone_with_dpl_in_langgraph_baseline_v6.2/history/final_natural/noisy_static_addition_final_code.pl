Here's the complete DeepProbLog code that captures all the requirements from the ruleset:

```prolog
nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y).

0.1::noisy.

uniform(X,Y,V) :- V::[0:1/19,1:1/19,2:1/19,3:1/19,4:1/19,5:1/19,6:1/19,7:1/19,8:1/19,9:1/19,10:1/19,11:1/19,12:1/19,13:1/19,14:1/19,15:1/19,16:1/19,17:1/19,18:1/19].

addition_noisy(X,Y,Z) :- noisy, uniform(X,Y,Z).
addition_noisy(X,Y,Z) :- \+noisy, digit(X,N1), digit(Y,N2), Z is N1+N2.
addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,N1), digit(Y,N2), Z is N1+N2.
```

Note that I made the following interpretations:
1. Changed `t(0.1)` to `0.1::noisy` as this is the standard ProbLog syntax for probabilistic facts
2. Implemented the uniform distribution over 0-18 using explicit probabilities for each value
3. Kept all the original rules exactly as specified
4. Maintained the same predicate names and structure from the original ruleset
