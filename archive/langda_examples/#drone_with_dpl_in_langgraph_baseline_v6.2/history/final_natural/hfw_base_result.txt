The generated code is a valid translation of the original code. It successfully replaces the langda terms while maintaining all the functionality from the original rule set. The neural network declarations (net1 and net2) are preserved, as are the detect_all and almost_equal predicates. The expression and parse predicates are also correctly implemented, including all the original arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction via multiplication by -1, multiplication, and division with zero check). The code follows standard Prolog/ProbLog syntax and avoids using the '->' symbol as requested. There are no identified issues with the generated code.
