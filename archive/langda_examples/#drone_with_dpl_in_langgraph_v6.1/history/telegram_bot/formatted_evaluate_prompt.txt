System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the complete code, the code blocks that need to be analyzed, please generate the report as required.

<ruleset>
### The full rule set with is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

% UAV properties
initial_charge ~ normal(90, 5).
charge_cost ~ normal(-0.1, 0.2).
weight ~ normal(0.2, 0.1).
% Weather conditions
1/10::fog; 9/10::clear.
% Visual line of sight
vlos(X) :-
fog, distance(X, operator) < 50;
clear, distance(X, operator) < 100;
clear, over(X, bay), distance(X, operator) < 400.
% Sufficient charge to return to operator
can_return(X) :-
B is initial_charge, O is charge_cost,
D is distance(X, operator), 0 < B + (2 * O * D).
sensitive_section(X) :-
{{LANGDA}}
security(X) :-
vlos(X),
sensitive_section(X).
% Permits related to local features
permits(X) :-
distance(X, service) < 15; distance(X, primary) < 15;
distance(X, secondary) < 10; distance(X, tertiary) < 5;
distance(X, crossing) < 5; distance(X, rail) < 5;
over(X, park).
% Definition of a valid mission
landscape(X) :-
security(X), weight < 25, can_return(X);
permits(X), can_return(X).

</ruleset>
<code_list>
### The parts that need to be analyzed in the entire code are:

The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:
distance(X, bomb) > 100.
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: D729E529
Requirements of Rules: Stay 100 meters away from bomb

Please make sure the code fits inside the placeholder(Which means it doesn't have to be a 'complete' code).


</code_list>
<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
</requirements>
<annotations>
# Important: If there is a '->' symbol in the code, please mark it as an error.
</annotations>
