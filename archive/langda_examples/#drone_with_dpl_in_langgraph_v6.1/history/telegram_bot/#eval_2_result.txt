    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement to stay 100 meters away from a bomb. The rule 'sensitive_section(X) :- distance(X, bomb) > 100.' ensures that any location X is considered a sensitive section only if it is more than 100 meters away from a bomb. This fits perfectly within the placeholder and adheres to the specified requirements. There are no errors such as '->' symbols present in the code.",
