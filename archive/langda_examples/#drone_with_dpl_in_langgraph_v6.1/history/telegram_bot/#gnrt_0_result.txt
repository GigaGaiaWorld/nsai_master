Here's the generated code in the requested JSON format for the first placeholder:

```json
{
    "HASH": "D729E529",
    "Code": "distance(X, bomb) > 100."
}
```

This code satisfies all the requirements:
1. It fits exactly in the `sensitive_section(X)` predicate placeholder
2. It implements the rule to stay 100 meters away from bomb
3. It uses proper Prolog syntax without using the '->' symbol
4. The hash matches exactly as provided in the requirements
5. The code is provided in the requested JSON format

The code will make the `sensitive_section(X)` predicate true when the UAV is more than 100 meters away from any bomb, which is the safety requirement specified.
