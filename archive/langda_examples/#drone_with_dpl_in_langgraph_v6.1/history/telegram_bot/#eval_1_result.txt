However, it is not integrated into any existing rule or predicate in the provided ruleset. To be fully functional within the DeepProblog context, it should be incorporated into a relevant predicate (e.g., 'security(X)' or a new safety-related rule). Currently, it stands alone and does not affect the logic of the program.",
