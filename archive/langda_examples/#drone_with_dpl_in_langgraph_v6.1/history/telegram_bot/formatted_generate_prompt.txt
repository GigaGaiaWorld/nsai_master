System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with placeholders and the requirements, please generate the report as required.


<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with placeholder is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 
% UAV properties
initial_charge ~ normal(90, 5).
charge_cost ~ normal(-0.1, 0.2).
weight ~ normal(0.2, 0.1).
% Weather conditions
1/10::fog; 9/10::clear.
% Visual line of sight
vlos(X) :-
fog, distance(X, operator) < 50;
clear, distance(X, operator) < 100;
clear, over(X, bay), distance(X, operator) < 400.
% Sufficient charge to return to operator
can_return(X) :-
B is initial_charge, O is charge_cost,
D is distance(X, operator), 0 < B + (2 * O * D).
sensitive_section(X) :-
{{LANGDA}}
security(X) :-
vlos(X),
sensitive_section(X).
% Permits related to local features
permits(X) :-
distance(X, service) < 15; distance(X, primary) < 15;
distance(X, secondary) < 10; distance(X, tertiary) < 5;
distance(X, crossing) < 5; distance(X, rail) < 5;
over(X, park).
% Definition of a valid mission
landscape(X) :-
security(X), weight < 25, can_return(X);
permits(X), can_return(X).

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could fit in the {LANGDA} placeholder based on following requirements, and nothing more. 

The Information for Generating Code of 1st Placeholder, inside the Parent Predicate: sensitive_section(X)
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: D729E529
Requirements of Rules: Stay 100 meters away from bomb


Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single prolog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```prolog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```prolog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
``` 

### This is really important! Also make sure to use the correct syntax. Please make sure your code fits completely inside the placeholder.
