    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the given rules for the zebra puzzle. Each rule is accurately translated into Prolog constraints. The constraints are well-structured and cover all 16 requirements. The use of 'member', 'right_of', and 'next_to' predicates is appropriate for solving the puzzle. The code fits within the placeholder and does not contain any '->' symbols, which would be marked as errors.",
