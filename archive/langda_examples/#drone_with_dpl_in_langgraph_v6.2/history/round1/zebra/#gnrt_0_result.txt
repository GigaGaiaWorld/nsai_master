Here's the generated code for the first placeholder in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "HASH": "10D48CC4",
    "Code": "member(house(englishman, _, _, _, red), Houses),\nmember(house(spaniard, dog, _, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, coffee, _, green), Houses),\nmember(house(ukrainian, _, tea, _, _), Houses),\nright_of(house(_, _, _, _, green), house(_, _, _, _, ivory), Houses),\nmember(house(_, snails, _, winston, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, _, kools, yellow), Houses),\nHouses = [_, _, house(_, _, milk, _, _), _, _],\nHouses = [house(norwegian, _, _, _, _)|_],\nnext_to(house(_, _, _, chesterfields, _), house(_, fox, _, _, _), Houses),\nnext_to(house(_, _, _, kools, _), house(_, horse, _, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes, _), Houses),\nmember(house(japanese, _, _, parliaments, _), Houses),\nnext_to(house(norwegian, _, _, _, _), house(_, _, _, _, blue), Houses),\nmember(house(_, zebra, _, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, water, _, _), Houses),"
