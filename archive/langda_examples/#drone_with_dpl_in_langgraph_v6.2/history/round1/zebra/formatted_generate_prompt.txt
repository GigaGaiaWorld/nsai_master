System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with placeholders and the requirements, please generate the report as required.


<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with placeholder is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 
zebra(Houses) :-
 houses(Houses),
 
{{LANGDA}}
houses([
 house(_, _, _, _, _),
 house(_, _, _, _, _),
 house(_, _, _, _, _),
 house(_, _, _, _, _),
 house(_, _, _, _, _)
]).
right_of(A, B, [B, A | _]).
right_of(A, B, [_ | Y]) :- right_of(A, B, Y).
next_to(A, B, [A, B | _]).
next_to(A, B, [B, A | _]).
next_to(A, B, [_ | Y]) :- next_to(A, B, Y).
my_member(X, [X|_]).
my_member(X, [_|Y]) :- my_member(X, Y).
query(zebra(Houses)).

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could fit in the {LANGDA} placeholder based on following requirements, and nothing more.

Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single prolog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```prolog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```prolog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
``` 

### This is really important! Also make sure to use the correct syntax. Please make sure your code fits completely inside the placeholder.
