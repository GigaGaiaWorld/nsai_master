System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with placeholders and the requirements, please generate the report as required.


<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with placeholder is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 
% member/2 for ProbLog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
% --------- Basic meta-interpreter ---------
% Prove "true" always succeeds
prove(true).
prove(Goal) :-
	% For all other goals, use the clause/2 facts/rules defined in the program
	clause(Goal, Body),
	prove(Body).
% Prove compound goal A,B: prove A first, then prove B
prove((A,B)) :-
	prove(A),
	prove(B).
% --------- Extended logic processing ---------
% 1. implies(P,Q): P â‡’ Q, when P is unprovable or Q is provable
prove(implies(P,Q)) :-
	( \+ prove(P) % if P is unprovable
	; prove(Q) ).
 % or Q is provable
% 2. opposite(P): "opposite"/negation of P; that is, P is unprovable
prove(opposite(P)) :-
	\+ prove(P).
% 3. expand(A,B): first use expand/2 rule to expand A into B, then prove B
% You need to define several expand/2 facts or rules in the program
prove(expand(A,B)) :-
	expand(A,B).
% 4. includes(Set,X): set inclusion relation, equivalent to member/2
prove(includes(Set,X)) :-
	member(X,Set).
% 5. extend(List,Elem,Extended): add Elem to the head of List to get Extended
prove(extend(List,Elem,Extended)) :-
	Extended = [Elem|List].
% 6. refute(P): refute, equivalent to "unprovable"
prove(refute(P)) :-
	\+ prove(P).
% --------- Examples ---------- %
% facts:
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, carol).
% Define some expand rules:
{{LANGDA}}
query(prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))).

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could fit in the {LANGDA} placeholder based on following requirements, and nothing more. 

The Information for Generating Code of 1st Placeholder
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: 397E4F86
Requirements of Rules: define the logic of parent and ancestor


Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single prolog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```prolog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```prolog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
``` 

### This is really important! Also make sure to use the correct syntax. Please make sure your code fits completely inside the placeholder.
