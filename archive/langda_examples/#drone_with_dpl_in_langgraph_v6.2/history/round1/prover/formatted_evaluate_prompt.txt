System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the complete code, the code blocks that need to be analyzed, please generate the report as required.


<\context>
<ruleset>
### The full rule set with is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

% member/2 for ProbLog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
% --------- Basic meta-interpreter ---------
% Prove "true" always succeeds
prove(true).
prove(Goal) :-
	% For all other goals, use the clause/2 facts/rules defined in the program
	clause(Goal, Body),
	prove(Body).
% Prove compound goal A,B: prove A first, then prove B
prove((A,B)) :-
	prove(A),
	prove(B).
% --------- Extended logic processing ---------
% 1. implies(P,Q): P â‡’ Q, when P is unprovable or Q is provable
prove(implies(P,Q)) :-
	( \+ prove(P) % if P is unprovable
	; prove(Q) ).
 % or Q is provable
% 2. opposite(P): "opposite"/negation of P; that is, P is unprovable
prove(opposite(P)) :-
	\+ prove(P).
% 3. expand(A,B): first use expand/2 rule to expand A into B, then prove B
% You need to define several expand/2 facts or rules in the program
prove(expand(A,B)) :-
	expand(A,B).
% 4. includes(Set,X): set inclusion relation, equivalent to member/2
prove(includes(Set,X)) :-
	member(X,Set).
% 5. extend(List,Elem,Extended): add Elem to the head of List to get Extended
prove(extend(List,Elem,Extended)) :-
	Extended = [Elem|List].
% 6. refute(P): refute, equivalent to "unprovable"
prove(refute(P)) :-
	\+ prove(P).
% --------- Examples ---------- %
% facts:
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, carol).
% Define some expand rules:
{{LANGDA}}
query(prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))).

</ruleset>
<code_list>
### The parts that need to be analyzed in the entire code are:

The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y).
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: 397E4F86
Requirements of Rules: define the logic of parent and ancestor

Please make sure the code fits inside the placeholder(Which means it doesn't have to be a 'complete' code).


</code_list>
<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
</requirements>
<annotations>
# Important: If there is a '->' symbol in the code, please mark it as an error.
</annotations>
