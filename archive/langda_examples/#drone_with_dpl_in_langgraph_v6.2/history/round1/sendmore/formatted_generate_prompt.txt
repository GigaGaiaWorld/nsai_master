System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate the code in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the the code with placeholders and the requirements, please generate the report as required.


<\context>
<ruleset>
### The original rule set with placeholder is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 
% Cryptoaddition:
% Find the unique answer to:
% SEND
% + MORE
% -------
% MONEY
query_sum([C,R,O,S,S,R,O,A,D,S]) :-
 
{{LANGDA}}
a
digit(0).
 digit(1).
 digit(2).
 digit(3).
 digit(4).
digit(5).
 digit(6).
 digit(7).
 digit(8).
 digit(9).
leftdigit(D) :- digit(D), D =\= 0.
all_different([]).
all_different([H|T]) :- \+ member(H, T), all_different(T).
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
query(query_sum(X)).

</ruleset>
<requirements>
To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could fit in the {LANGDA} placeholder based on following requirements, and nothing more. 

The Information for Generating Code of 1st Placeholder, inside the Parent Predicate: query_sum([C,R,O,S,S,R,O,A,D,S])
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: E8F86752
Requirements of Rules: % Cryptoaddition:  % Find the unique answer to:  % CROSS  % + ROADS  % -------  % DANGER


Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single prolog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```prolog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```prolog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
``` 

### This is really important! Also make sure to use the correct syntax. Please make sure your code fits completely inside the placeholder.
