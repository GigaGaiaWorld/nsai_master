    "Report": "The code block implements a cryptarithmetic puzzle solver for the equation CROSS + ROADS = DANGER. The constraints are correctly set up to ensure that each letter represents a unique digit (0-9) and that the first digits of each word (C, R, D) are non-zero. The carry variables (C1-C5) are initialized and used correctly to propagate the addition constraints. The all_different/1 predicate ensures all letters have distinct values. The code matches the requirements specified in the ruleset and correctly implements the cryptoaddition problem.",
