Here are the reports for the code blocks:

```report
{
    "HASH": "CD6DE9CB",
    "Report": "The code block correctly implements a query to find pairs of countries with roughly equal population density. It uses the density/2 predicate to calculate the density for two different countries (C1 and C2), ensures they are not the same country (C1 \\= C2), and checks if their density difference is within 5 units (abs(D1 - D2) =< 5). The logic is sound and matches the requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "23C2CC6E",
    "Report": "The code block correctly lists population facts for various countries in the specified format (pop(country, population)). The values match the requirements exactly (e.g., china has population 8250, india has 5863, etc.). The syntax is correct and there are no errors.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
