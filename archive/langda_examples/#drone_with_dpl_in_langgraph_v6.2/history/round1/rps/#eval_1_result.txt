Here's the report for the first code block:

```report
{
    "HASH": "8934D879",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the specified rules for the extended rock-paper-scissors game. It defines 5 possible moves (mammals, arthropods, lizards, birds, fishes) and establishes the correct beating relationships as per requirements: 1. mammals beat arthropods and fishes, 2. arthropods beat lizards, 3. lizards beat mammals and birds, 4. birds beat arthropods and fishes, 5. fishes beat arthropods. The syntax is correct and matches Prolog conventions. All specified requirements are properly implemented without any errors or '->' symbols present.",
    "Need_regenerate": "false"
}
```

Note: Since only one code block was provided in the code_list section, I've only generated one report. The report confirms that the code correctly implements all the specified rules for the extended rock-paper-scissors game variant and doesn't need to be regenerated.
