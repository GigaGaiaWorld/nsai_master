System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the complete code, the code blocks that need to be analyzed, please generate the report as required.

<ruleset>
### The full rule set with is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

% -------------------------
% Basic rules of rock-paper-scissors
% -------------------------
% Three gestures
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
{{LANGDA}}
% -------------------------
% Calculate the result of the game
% -------------------------
% Same gestures are considered a draw
result(X, X, draw) :-
move(X).
% If X beats Y, then X wins
result(X, Y, win) :-
beats(X, Y).
% If Y beats X, then X loses
result(X, Y, lose) :-
beats(Y, X).
% End of recursion: empty list corresponds to empty result
play([], [], []).
% Recursive advancement: take out each round of gestures, calculate the results, and continue
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
% The correct call is result(P1,P2,R), not semicolon
result(P1, P2, R),
% (Optional) Update the score according to R
play(P1T, P2T, Rs).
compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), 
compute_score(Results,S), 
( S > 0, Winner = player1 
; S < 0, Winner = player2 
; S = 0, Winner = draw 
).
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).

</ruleset>
<code_list>
### The parts that need to be analyzed in the entire code are:

The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:
move(mammals).
move(arthropods).
move(lizards).
move(birds).
move(fishes).
beats(mammals, arthropods).
beats(mammals, fishes).
beats(arthropods, lizards).
beats(lizards, mammals).
beats(lizards, birds).
beats(birds, arthropods).
beats(birds, fishes).
beats(fishes, arthropods).
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: 8934D879
Requirements of Rules: We define new rules for rock-paper-scissors:  1. mammals restrain arthropods and fishes  2. arthropods restrain lizards  3. lizards restrain mammals and birds  4. birds restrain arthropods and fishes  5. fishes restrain arthropods.

Please make sure the code fits inside the placeholder(Which means it doesn't have to be a 'complete' code).


</code_list>
<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
</requirements>
<annotations>
# Important: If there is a '->' symbol in the code, please mark it as an error.
</annotations>
