Report:
The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues to note. First, the generated code correctly translates the natural language constraints into Prolog predicates, such as 'member', 'right_of', and 'next_to'. The structure of the 'houses' predicate and the auxiliary predicates ('right_of', 'next_to', 'my_member') are correctly replicated from the original code. However, there is a redundant definition of the 'houses' predicate at the end of the generated code, which is already defined at the beginning. This redundancy does not affect the functionality but is unnecessary. Additionally, the 'query(zebra(Houses))' at the end of the generated code is misplaced and should not be part of the predicate definition. Despite these minor issues, the generated code is functionally correct and meets the requirements.
