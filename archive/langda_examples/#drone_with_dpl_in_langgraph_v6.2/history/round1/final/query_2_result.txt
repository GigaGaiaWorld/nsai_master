Report:
The generated code is mostly valid but contains some issues. The main issue is the duplicate definition of the `query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2])` predicate. The first definition is incomplete and lacks the body, while the second definition is correct and matches the intended functionality of finding pairs of countries with roughly equal population density. The rest of the code, including the `density/2` predicate and the facts for `pop/2` and `area/2`, is correctly replicated from the original code. The `query(query_pop(X))` directive is also correctly included. The generated code would work as intended if the incomplete first definition of `query_pop/1` is removed.
