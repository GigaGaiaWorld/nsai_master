Here's the generated code for the placeholder in JSON format:

```json
{
    "HASH": "CD6DE9CB",
    "Code": "density(C1,D1),\ndensity(C2,D2),\nC1 \\= C2,\nabs(D1 - D2) =< 10."
}
```

This code:
1. Finds densities for two different countries (C1 and C2)
2. Ensures they're different countries (C1 \= C2)
3. Checks if their densities are roughly equal (within 10 units of each other)
4. Matches the requirement to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population density

The code uses absolute difference (abs) to determine approximate equality rather than exact equality, which fits the "roughly equal" requirement. The threshold of 10 units provides a reasonable margin for considering densities approximately equal.
