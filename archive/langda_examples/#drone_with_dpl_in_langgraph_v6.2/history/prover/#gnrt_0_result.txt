Here's the generated code for the placeholder based on the requirements:

```json
{
    "HASH": "397E4F86",
    "Code": "ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y).\nancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y)."
}
```

This code defines the ancestor relationship in two parts:
1. A direct ancestor relationship (parent is an ancestor)
2. A transitive ancestor relationship (if X is parent of Z and Z is ancestor of Y, then X is ancestor of Y)

The code fits the requirements by:
- Using the exact hash provided (397E4F86)
- Defining the logic of parent and ancestor relationships
- Not using the '->' symbol
- Being valid Prolog syntax that will work with the existing prove/1 meta-interpreter
- Fitting completely within the placeholder
