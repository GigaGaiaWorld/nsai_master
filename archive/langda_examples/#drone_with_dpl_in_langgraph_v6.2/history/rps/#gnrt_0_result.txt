Here's the generated code for the placeholder {LANGDA} based on the requirements:

```json
{
    "HASH": "8934D879",
    "Code": "move(mammals).\nmove(arthropods).\nmove(lizards).\nmove(birds).\nmove(fishes).\n\nbeats(mammals, arthropods).\nbeats(mammals, fishes).\nbeats(arthropods, lizards).\nbeats(lizards, mammals).\nbeats(lizards, birds).\nbeats(birds, arthropods).\nbeats(birds, fishes).\nbeats(fishes, arthropods)."
}
```

This code defines:
1. All possible moves (mammals, arthropods, lizards, birds, fishes)
2. The beating relationships according to the specified rules:
   - mammals beat arthropods and fishes
   - arthropods beat lizards
   - lizards beat mammals and birds
   - birds beat arthropods and fishes
   - fishes beat arthropods

The code follows standard Prolog syntax and completely replaces the {LANGDA} placeholder in the original ruleset.
