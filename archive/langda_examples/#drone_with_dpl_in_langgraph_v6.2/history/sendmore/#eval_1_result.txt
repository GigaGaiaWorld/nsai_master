    "Report": "The code block implements a cryptarithmetic puzzle solver for the equation CROSS + ROADS = DANGER. The constraints are correctly set up with leftdigit/1 ensuring leading digits (C, R, D) are non-zero, and digit/1 allowing digits 0-9 for other letters. The all_different/1 constraint ensures all letters map to unique digits. The arithmetic equation correctly represents the addition with proper place values (units, tens, hundreds, etc.). The code fits the placeholder and matches the requirements specified in the ruleset.",
