System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the complete code, the code blocks that need to be analyzed, please generate the report as required.


<\context>
<ruleset>
### The full rule set with is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

% Cryptoaddition:
% Find the unique answer to:
% SEND
% + MORE
% -------
% MONEY
query_sum([C,R,O,S,S,R,O,A,D,S]) :-
 
{{LANGDA}}
digit(0).
 digit(1).
 digit(2).
 digit(3).
 digit(4).
digit(5).
 digit(6).
 digit(7).
 digit(8).
 digit(9).
leftdigit(D) :- digit(D), D =\= 0.
all_different([]).
all_different([H|T]) :- \+ member(H, T), all_different(T).
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
query(query_sum(X)).

</ruleset>
<code_list>
### The parts that need to be analyzed in the entire code are:

The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:
leftdigit(C), leftdigit(R), leftdigit(D),
    digit(O), digit(A), digit(S), digit(N), digit(G), digit(E),
    all_different([C,R,O,S,A,D,N,G,E]),
    S + S + 10*O + 10*R + 100*A + 100*S + 1000*R + 1000*O + 10000*C =
    E + 10*R + 100*G + 1000*N + 10000*A + 100000*D.
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: E8F86752
Requirements of Rules: % Cryptoaddition:  % Find the unique answer to:  % CROSS  % + ROADS  % -------  % DANGER

Please make sure the code fits inside the placeholder(Which means it doesn't have to be a 'complete' code).

<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
</requirements>
<annotations>
# Important: If there is a '->' symbol in the code, please mark it as an error.
</annotations>
