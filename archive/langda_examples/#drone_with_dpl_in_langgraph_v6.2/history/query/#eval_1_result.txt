    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the logic to find pairs of countries with roughly equal population density. It uses the 'density/2' predicate to calculate the population density for two different countries (C1 and C2), ensures they are not the same country (C1 \\= C2), and checks if the absolute difference in their densities is less than or equal to 1 (abs(D1 - D2) =< 1). This meets the requirement of finding countries with approximately equal population density. The code is syntactically correct and fits well within the DeepProblog framework.",
