Here's the generated code for the placeholder {LANGDA} based on the requirements:

```json
{
    "HASH": "CD6DE9CB",
    "Code": "density(C1,D1), density(C2,D2), C1 \\= C2, abs(D1 - D2) =< 1."
}
```

This code:
1. Finds two countries (C1 and C2) with their respective densities (D1 and D2)
2. Ensures they are different countries (C1 \\= C2)
3. Checks if their population densities are roughly equal (within 1 unit of each other)
4. Uses the abs/1 function to calculate absolute difference between densities

The code fits the requirement of finding pairs of countries with approximately equal population density and will work within the given Prolog-style rule structure.
