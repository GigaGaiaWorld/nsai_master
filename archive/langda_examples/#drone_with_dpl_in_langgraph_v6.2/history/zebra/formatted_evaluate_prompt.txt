System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <context>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the complete code, the code blocks that need to be analyzed, please generate the report as required.


<\context>
<ruleset>
### The full rule set with is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

zebra(Houses) :-
 houses(Houses),
 
{{LANGDA}}
houses([
 house(_, _, _, _, _),
 house(_, _, _, _, _),
 house(_, _, _, _, _),
 house(_, _, _, _, _),
 house(_, _, _, _, _)
]).
right_of(A, B, [B, A | _]).
right_of(A, B, [_ | Y]) :- right_of(A, B, Y).
next_to(A, B, [A, B | _]).
next_to(A, B, [B, A | _]).
next_to(A, B, [_ | Y]) :- next_to(A, B, Y).
my_member(X, [X|_]).
my_member(X, [_|Y]) :- my_member(X, Y).
query(zebra(Houses)).

</ruleset>
<code_list>
### The parts that need to be analyzed in the entire code are:

The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:
member(house(englishman, _, _, red, _), Houses),
member(house(spaniard, dog, _, _, _), Houses),
member(house(_, _, coffee, green, _), Houses),
member(house(ukrainian, _, tea, _, _), Houses),
right_of(house(_, _, _, green, _), house(_, _, _, ivory, _), Houses),
member(house(_, snails, _, _, winston), Houses),
member(house(_, _, _, yellow, kools), Houses),
Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, milk, _, _), _, _],
Houses = [house(norwegian, _, _, _, _)|_],
next_to(house(_, _, _, _, chesterfields), house(_, fox, _, _, _), Houses),
next_to(house(_, _, _, _, kools), house(_, horse, _, _, _), Houses),
member(house(_, _, orange_juice, _, lucky_strikes), Houses),
member(house(japanese, _, _, _, parliaments), Houses),
next_to(house(norwegian, _, _, _, _), house(_, _, _, blue, _), Houses),
member(house(_, zebra, _, _, _), Houses),
member(house(_, _, water, _, _), Houses),
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: 10D48CC4
Requirements of Rules: 1. The Englishman lives in the red house. 2. The Spaniard owns the dog. 3. The owner of the green house drinks coffee. 4. The Ukrainian drinks tea. 5. The green house is to the right of the ivory house. 6. The Winston smoker keeps snails. 7. The Kools are smoked in the yellow house. 8. Milk is in the middle (third) house. 9. The Norwegian lives in the first house. 10. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the one who keeps a fox. 11. The man who smokes Kools lives next to the one who keeps a horse. 12. The Lucky Strikes smoker drinks orange juice. 13. The Japanese smokes Parliaments. 14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house. 15. One of the house­holders keeps a zebra. 16. One of the house­holders drinks water.

Please make sure the code fits inside the placeholder(Which means it doesn't have to be a 'complete' code).

<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
</requirements>
<annotations>
# Important: If there is a '->' symbol in the code, please mark it as an error.
</annotations>
