I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the complete code, the code blocks that need to be analyzed, please generate the report as required.

### The parts that need to be analyzed in the entire code are:

The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:
country(C1), country(C2), C1 \\= C2, density(C1,D1), density(C2,D2), abs(D1 - D2) < 10.
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: CD6DE9CB
Requirements of Rules: Find a pair of countries with roughly equal population density

Please make sure the code fits inside the placeholder(Which means it doesn't have to be a 'complete' code).

The 2nd Code Block That You Should Analyse:
pop(china, 8250).
pop(india, 5863).
pop(ussr, 2521).
pop(usa, 2119).
pop(indonesia, 1276).
pop(japan, 1097).
pop(brazil, 1042).
pop(bangladesh, 750).
pop(pakistan, 682).
pop(w_germany, 613).
Hash tag of code, please use it actually for generation: 23C2CC6E
Requirements of Rules: the popluation of china is 8250,  the popluation of india is 5863,  the popluation of ussr is 2521,  the popluation of usa is 2119,  the popluation of indonesia is 1276,  the popluation of japan is 1097,  the popluation of brazil is 1042,  the popluation of bangladesh is 750,  the popluation of pakistan is 682,  the popluation of w_germany is 613

Please make sure the code fits inside the placeholder(Which means it doesn't have to be a 'complete' code).


</code_list>
<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
</requirements>
<annotations>
# Important: If there is a '->' symbol in the code, please mark it as an error.
</annotations>
