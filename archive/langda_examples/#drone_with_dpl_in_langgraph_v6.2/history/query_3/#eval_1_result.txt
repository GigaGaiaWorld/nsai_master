Here are the reports for the provided code blocks:

```report
{
    "HASH": "CD6DE9CB",
    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the logic to find pairs of countries with roughly equal population density. It uses the 'country' predicate to get country names, ensures they are different (C1 \\= C2), calculates their densities using the 'density' predicate, and checks if the absolute difference between densities is less than 10. The logic is sound and fits the requirements perfectly.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "23C2CC6E",
    "Report": "The code block correctly lists population facts for various countries in the specified format (pop(country, population)). All values match the requirements exactly (e.g., china has population 8250, india has 5863, etc.). The syntax is correct and complete for a Prolog fact database.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
