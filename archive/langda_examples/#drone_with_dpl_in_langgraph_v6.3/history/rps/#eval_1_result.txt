{"HASH": "8934D879","Report": "// Analysis: The code block correctly implements all specified Langda rules. It accurately defines: 1) mammal beats arthropod and fish, 2) arthropod beats lizard, 3) lizard beats mammal and bird, 4) bird beats arthropod and fish, and 5) fish beats arthropod. The test failure is due to incompatible test inputs (standard RPS moves) rather than code errors. The implementation fully satisfies the design requirements.","Need_regenerate": "false"}
```

The zero probability result in the test is expected because the query uses standard RPS moves ('rock', 'paper') which aren't defined in this Langda implementation. The code itself is correct and complete for the specified biological version of the game.
