### The full rule set with placeholders is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code:

<code_list>
### Here are the code blocks and their analysis:

{requirements}

<code_list>
<requirements>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}}
``` 


### This is really important! Also make sure to use the correct syntax. Make sure to address all the issues mentioned in the evaluation and please make sure your code fits completely inside the placeholder!
