I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the complete code, the code blocks that need to be analyzed, please generate the report as required.

<ruleset>
### The full rule set with is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

{output}

<code_list>
### The parts that need to be analyzed in the entire code are:

{code_list}

</code_list>
<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
</requirements>
<annotations>
# Important: If there is a '->' symbol in the code, please mark it as an error.
