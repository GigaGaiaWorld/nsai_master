To complete the Prolog-style rule code according to the following Problog Code, Please generate the code that could fit in the {{LANGDA}} placeholder based on following requirements, and nothing more. 

{requirements}

Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}}
``` 

### This is really important! Also make sure to use the correct syntax. Please make sure your code fits completely inside the placeholder.
