Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action

Final Answer: the final answer should be a single string containing an analysis for each generated code block.  Provide each code block's evaluation as a JSON object in the following format:
```report
{{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "// Analysis: This segment correctly implements the intended logic with no errors or redundancies.","Need_regenerate": "false"}}
```
```report
{{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Report": "// Analysis: This segment fails to cover an important case and has a logic error in the recursion.","Need_regenerate": "true"}}
```
