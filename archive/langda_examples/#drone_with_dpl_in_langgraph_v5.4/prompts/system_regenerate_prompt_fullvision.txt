I need you to fix some errors in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give you the code with placeholders, content of the code block and corresponding analysis to each code block that need to be regenerated, please generate the code as required.

<ruleset>
### The full rule set with placeholders is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

{rule_set}
</ruleset>
<code_list>
### Here are the code blocks and their analysis:

{blocks_with_analysis}

<code_list>
<requirements>
### Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report. For the code blocks that do not need to be regenerated, please keep the same content. 
### For each block of code, please output a code block in the following format:

```prolog
// Your fixed code here
```

Make sure to address all the issues mentioned in the evaluation.

<example>
### original code with placeholder:
nn(net1, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(1,X,Y).
nn(net2, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(2,X,Y).

outcome(X,X,win).
{{LANGDA}}

game(X,Outcome) :-
    coin(1,X,C1),
    coin(2,X,C2),
    {{LANGDA}}.

### Here are the code blocks and their analysis:
### The 1st Code Block:
outcome(X,Y,loss) :- \+outcome(X,Y,win).

It's corresponding analysis:
Report: correct, it's suitable for the current code
Need_regenerate: False

### The 2nd Code Block:
outcome(C1,C2,game)

It's corresponding analysis:
Report: there's an error, the third item should be "Outcome" instead of "game"
Need_regenerate: True

### Generated Code Blocks: 
```prolog
outcome(X,Y,loss) :- \+outcome(X,Y,win).
```
```prolog
outcome(C1,C2,Outcome)
```
### then I could fit the generated code into the placeholder myself:
nn(net1, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(1,X,Y).
nn(net2, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(2,X,Y).

outcome(X,X,win).
outcome(X,Y,loss) :- \+outcome(X,Y,win).

game(X,Outcome) :-
    coin(1,X,C1),
    coin(2,X,C2),
    outcome(C1,C2,Outcome).
