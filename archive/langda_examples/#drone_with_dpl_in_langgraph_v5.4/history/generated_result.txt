Here are the generated code blocks for the placeholders:

For the 0th placeholder (bomb safety requirement):
```prolog
distance(X, bomb) >= 100.
```

For the 1st placeholder (landscape predicate):
```prolog
(vlos(X), weight < 0.3, can_return(X));
(permits(X), can_return(X)),
distance(X, bomb) >= 100.
```

The code follows all requirements:
1. For the bomb safety, it enforces a 100m distance requirement
2. For the landscape predicate, it implements both conditions:
   - Visual range + light weight + return capability
   - Permits + return capability
3. It maintains the bomb safety requirement from the first placeholder
4. Uses proper Prolog syntax without the '->' operator
5. Each block can be directly inserted into its respective placeholder
