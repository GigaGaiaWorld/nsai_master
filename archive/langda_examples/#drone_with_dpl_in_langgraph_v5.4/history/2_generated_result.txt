Based on the analysis, I'll regenerate the code blocks that need fixing:

### For the 0th Code Block:
This should be integrated into the landscape rule rather than being standalone.

### For the 1st Code Block:
This needs to be properly structured as a rule body.

Here are the regenerated code blocks:

```prolog
% Removed standalone constraint - will be integrated into landscape rule
```

```prolog
landscape(X) :-
    ((vlos(X), weight < 0.3, can_return(X));
    (permits(X), can_return(X))),
    distance(X, bomb) >= 100.
```

The changes:
1. Removed the standalone distance constraint as it should be part of the landscape rule
2. Fixed the landscape rule by:
   - Properly nesting the disjunction (;) within parentheses
   - Moving the distance constraint into the rule body
   - Maintaining all the original conditions while fixing the structure

The regenerated code maintains all the original functionality while fixing the syntax issues identified in the analysis.
