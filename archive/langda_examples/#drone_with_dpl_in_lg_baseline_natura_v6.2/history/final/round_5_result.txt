The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are some issues to note. The supplementary logic for `game/3` has been implemented, but there are problems with the implementation. Specifically, in the `game(Cards,House,Outcome)` rule, the variables `R1` and `R2` are used inconsistently. The rule calls `best_hand_rank([card(R1),card(R2),House],R1)` and `best_hand_rank([card(R3),card(R4),House],R2)`, but these calls do not correctly reference the hands `H1` and `H2` obtained from the `game(Cards,House,H1,H2)` call. Additionally, the lists `[card(R1),card(R2),House]` and `[card(R3),card(R4),House]` do not correspond to the actual hands `C1` and `C2` that are derived from the `cards/4` predicate. This inconsistency could lead to incorrect outcomes. The rest of the code, including the probability distributions, neural network predictions, and other game logic, remains correct and consistent with the original code.
