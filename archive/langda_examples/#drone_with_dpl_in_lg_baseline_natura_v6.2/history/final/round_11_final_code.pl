Here's the completed DeepProblog code that replaces the langda term with the required supplementary logic for `game/3`:

```prolog
game(Cards,House,Outcome) :-
    cards(Cards,own,House,C1),
    cards(Cards,opponent,House,C2),
    best_hand_rank(C1,R1),
    best_hand_rank(C2,R2),
    outcome(R1,R2,Outcome).
```

This implementation:
1. Gets both player's cards using the `cards/4` predicate
2. Determines the rank of the best hand for each player using `best_hand_rank/2`
3. Compares the ranks using the `outcome/3` predicate to determine win/loss/draw
4. Matches the structure shown in the original code where `game/3` takes Cards, House, and Outcome as arguments

The code maintains all the existing functionality from the original rules while properly implementing the missing `game/3` predicate.
