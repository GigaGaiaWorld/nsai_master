The generated code is a valid replacement for the `langda` term in the original code. It correctly implements the supplementary logic for `game/3` by following the same pattern as the original `game/4` predicate but simplified for the 3-argument version. The generated code:

1. Maintains consistency with the original code's structure and logic
2. Properly uses all the existing predicates (cards/4, best_hand_rank/2, outcome/3)
3. Correctly determines the game outcome by comparing hand ranks
4. Preserves the same argument structure (Cards, House, Outcome)
5. Doesn't introduce any new variables or logic that would conflict with the original code

The implementation is correct and complete, providing the missing functionality while being fully compatible with the rest of the program.
