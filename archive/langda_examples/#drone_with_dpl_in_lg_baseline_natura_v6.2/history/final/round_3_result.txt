The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are some issues that need to be addressed. The supplementary logic for `game/3` has been implemented, but there are problems with the way it calculates the hand ranks. Specifically, the generated code uses `best_hand_rank` on individual cards (`[card(R1), card(R2), House]`), which is incorrect because `best_hand_rank` should be applied to the full hand (C1 and C2) that includes the house card. Additionally, the variables R1 and R2 in the `game(Cards,House,Outcome)` rule are reused in a way that could lead to confusion and incorrect results. The original code's structure and logic are preserved, but the implementation of the supplementary logic is flawed.
