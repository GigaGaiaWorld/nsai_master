The generated code is mostly valid and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed. The supplementary logic for `game/3` has been correctly implemented by adding the rule that takes a House parameter and computes the Outcome by getting the best hands for both players, their corresponding ranks, and determining the outcome based on these ranks. The rule that doesn't take a House parameter and instead samples it from `house_rank/1` has been kept as well. However, there is a critical issue in the generated code: the variables `C1` and `C2` used in the `best_hand_rank/2` calls within the `game(Cards, House, Outcome)` rule are not bound. These variables should be the same as those used in the `cards/4` calls earlier in the rule. Additionally, the `langda` annotation from the original code has been removed in the generated code, which might affect the intended functionality if it was meant to be part of the logic. Despite these issues, the overall structure and logic of the generated code are sound and mostly consistent with the original code.
