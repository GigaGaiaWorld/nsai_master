I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the complete code, the code blocks that need to be analyzed, please generate the report as required.
{context}

<\context>
<ruleset>
### The full rule set with is as follows, make sure you capture all the information from the code: 

{output}

</ruleset>
<error_report>
{error_report}
</error_report>
<code_list>
### The parts that need to be analyzed in the entire code are:

{code_list}

</code_list>
<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

```report
{{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[boolean]"
}}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
</requirements>
<example>
### The full code:
nn(net1, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(1,X,Y).
nn(net2, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(2,X,Y).

outcome(X,X,win).
outcome(X,Y,loss) :- \+outcome(X,Y,win).

game(X,Outcome) :-
    coin(1,X,C1),
    coin(2,X,C2),
    outcome(C1,C2,game).

### The parts that need to be analyzed in the entire code are:

The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:
outcome(X,Y,loss) :- \+outcome(X,Y,win).

The 2nd Code Block That You Should Analyse:
outcome(C1,C2,game)

### Generated Report Blocks: 
```report
{{
    "HASH": "ABCD1234",
    "Report": "correct, it's suitable for the current code",
    "Need_regenerate": "False"
}}
```
```report
{{
    "HASH": "EFGH5678",
    "Report": "there's an error, the third item should be 'Outcome' instead of 'game'",
    "Need_regenerate": "True"
}}
```

### then I could let llm regenerate code based on the errors in each part
nn(net1, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(1,X,Y).
nn(net2, [X], Y, [heads, tails]) :: coin(2,X,Y).

# Important: If there is a '->' symbol in the code, please mark it as an error.
