Based on the instructions, I'll extract and format only the exact content that was inside the <Langda> block from the original code, which has been completed in the generated code. Here's the extracted block:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900","Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n sumdigit(C2, E, N, O, C3),\n \n digit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n \n leftdigit(S), leftdigit(M),\n C4 = 0,\n all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y])."}
