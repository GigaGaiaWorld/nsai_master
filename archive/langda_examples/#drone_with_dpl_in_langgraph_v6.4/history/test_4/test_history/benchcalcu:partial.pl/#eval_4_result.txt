    "Report": "The code appears to be a partial implementation of a cryptarithmetic puzzle solver (likely for SEND+MORE=MONEY). The predicates 'digit' and 'all_different' are correctly used, but the 'sumdigit' predicate is incomplete/missing implementation. The error message indicates a problem with arithmetic evaluation ('is/2' predicate) where it expects ground terms but gets expressions with variables. The code needs the actual implementation of sumdigit predicate that properly handles digit addition with carry.",
