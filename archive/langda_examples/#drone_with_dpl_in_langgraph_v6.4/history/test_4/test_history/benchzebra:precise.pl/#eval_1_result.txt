    "Report": "The provided code block appears to be a description of a logic puzzle (similar to Einstein's Zebra Puzzle) rather than valid DeepProbLog code. The error message indicates that the parser expected binary operators but found natural language rules instead. To make this work in DeepProbLog, the rules need to be translated into proper probabilistic logic programming syntax with correct operators and predicates. The current format is not executable as DeepProbLog code.",
