    "Report": "The code block is a valid Prolog/DeepProblog implementation of the Zebra puzzle. It correctly defines the 5 houses and all the required constraints for solving the puzzle. The rules are properly implemented using my_member and next_to predicates to express the relationships between house attributes. The code matches all the requirements listed in the LLM section, including house arrangement, nationality rules, pet ownership, color constraints, and smoking preferences. The inference result shows it successfully solves the puzzle with probability 1.0000, indicating the code works correctly.",
