Based on the instructions, I'll extract and format only the code block that was inside the <langda> tags in the original code, which has been completed in the generated code.

The extracted code block is:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c), position(1,b)."}
```
