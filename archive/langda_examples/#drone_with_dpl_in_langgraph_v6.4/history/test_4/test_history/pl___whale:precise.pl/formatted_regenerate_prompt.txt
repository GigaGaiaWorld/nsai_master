In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

<Final_Answer> Each code block SHOULD ONLY CONTAINS THE EXACT CONTENT of <langda> blocks, for example:
for the following original code:
<Code>
head(X) :-
<Langda> Information of 1st Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: XXXXABCD </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules:...  </LLM></Langda>
//other contents...
</Code>
if you extracted code contains "head(X) :-", it's wrong, because it's OUTSIDE the <langda> block

For each code block , extract it and format it as follows:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
