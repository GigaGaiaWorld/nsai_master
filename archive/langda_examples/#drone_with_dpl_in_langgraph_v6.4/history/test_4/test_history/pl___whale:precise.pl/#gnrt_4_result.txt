Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c), position(1,b)."}
```

This is the exact content that replaced the <langda> block in the generated_code, maintaining the same hash tag (A90B08DE) that was present in the original placeholder. The code implements the rule for determining when the adult sperm whale abandons the baby whale based on the specified conditions.
