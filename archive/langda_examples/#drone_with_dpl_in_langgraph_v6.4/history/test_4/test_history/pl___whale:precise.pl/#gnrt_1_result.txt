Based on the instructions, I'll extract and format only the code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the original code. Here's the extracted and formatted code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c), true."}
```

Note that:
1. I only included the code that was inside the <langda> block's placeholder
2. The completed version adds ", true" at the end to properly connect the conditions to the 'abandon' action
3. I maintained the same HASH value from the original code block
4. The formatting follows exactly the requested structure with the problog language tag
