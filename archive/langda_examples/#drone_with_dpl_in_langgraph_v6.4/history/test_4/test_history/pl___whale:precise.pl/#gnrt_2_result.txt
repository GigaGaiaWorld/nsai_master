Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here is the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c), position(1,b)."}
```

Note that this is the completed version of the code that was previously marked as needing regeneration in the <langda> block. The main change is the addition of `position(1,b)` to properly model the abandonment condition (when the adult sperm whale is at position c and the calf is at position b).
