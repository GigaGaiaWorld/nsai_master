Here's the JSON report for each code block:

```report
{
    "HASH": "0C388A60",
    "Report": "The code 'move(paper).' is valid and correctly defines a possible move in the game. It matches the requirement of specifying a move of paper.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "BF964057",
    "Report": "The code 'move(scissor).' is valid and correctly defines a possible move in the game. It matches the requirement of specifying a move of scissor.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "59C3D0D4",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(paper, rock).' is valid and correctly defines the win-lose relationship where paper beats rock. It matches the requirement of specifying the win-lose relationship of paper.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "58D60F5E",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(scissor, paper).' is valid and correctly defines the win-lose relationship where scissor beats paper. It matches the requirement of specifying the win-lose relationship of scissor.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "94C4D48B",
    "Report": "The code 'compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.' is valid and correctly implements the scoring logic for lose cases. It recursively computes the score and decrements by 1 for each lose result.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "026B015E",
    "Report": "The code 'compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S).' is valid and correctly implements the scoring logic for draw cases. It recursively computes the score without changing it for draw results.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
