    "Report": "The code block implements all required functionalities for the prove/1 predicate as specified in the requirements. It correctly handles: 1. implies/2 for logical implication, 2. opposite/1 for negation, 3. expand/2 for term expansion, 4. includes/2 for list membership check, 5. extend/2 for list extension, and 6. refute/1 which is equivalent to opposite/1. The implementation matches the test results provided, showing correct behavior for all cases. The code is well-structured and follows logical programming conventions.",
