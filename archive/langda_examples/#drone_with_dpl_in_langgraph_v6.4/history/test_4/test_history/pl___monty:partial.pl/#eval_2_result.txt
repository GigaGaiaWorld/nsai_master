    "Report": "The code attempts to model a scenario where one of two unselected, non-prize doors is opened randomly with equal probability. However, there are several issues:\n1. The syntax for probabilistic disjunction is incorrect - ';' should be used between the probabilistic choices, not in the head.\n2. The conditions in the body are logically correct but the syntax needs adjustment.\n3. The error message indicates an operator priority clash, likely due to incorrect syntax structure.\n4. The rule doesn't properly implement the Monty Hall problem logic where the host knowingly opens an empty door.",
