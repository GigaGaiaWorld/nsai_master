Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code blocks that correspond to the <langda> placeholders:

1. For the first <langda> block (HASH: C5B4A895):
```problog
{"HASH": "C5B4A895", "Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    member(A, [1,2,3]),\n    member(B, [1,2,3]),\n    A \\= B,\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ select_door(B),\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B)."}
```

2. For the second <langda> block (placeholder after "open_door(A) :-"):
```problog
{"HASH": "", "Code": "member(A, [1,2,3]),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ prize(A)."}
```

3. For the third <langda> block (placeholder after "win_keep :-"):
```problog
{"HASH": "", "Code": "select_door(D),\n    prize(D)."}
```
