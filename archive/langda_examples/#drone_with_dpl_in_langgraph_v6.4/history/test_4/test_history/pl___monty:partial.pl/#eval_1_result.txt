Here are the evaluation reports for each code block in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "C5B4A895",
    "Report": "The code has a syntax error due to operator priority clash. The semicolon (;) operator for probabilistic disjunction is not properly used. The rule attempts to implement a random choice between two doors when both are unselected and empty, but the syntax is incorrect. The conditions (member/2, \\=/2, \\+/1) are correctly specified but the probability distribution syntax needs correction.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "338175EC",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the rule for when one unselected door has no prize and the other has a prize. The host will definitely open the door without a prize. The conditions are properly specified using member/2, \\=/2, and \\+/1 predicates. The logic is sound and matches the requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

For the third Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "B73E5085",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the winning condition for keeping the original door strategy. It simply states that you win if your selected door contains the prize. The implementation is concise and matches the requirements perfectly.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```
