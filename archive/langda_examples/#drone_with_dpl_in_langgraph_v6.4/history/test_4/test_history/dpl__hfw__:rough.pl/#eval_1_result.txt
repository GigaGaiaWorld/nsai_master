    "Report": "The code implements a recursive expression evaluator (parse/2) that handles basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as required. The implementation appears correct for processing expressions in list form, recursively reducing them until a single result is obtained. The operations are properly defined with operator precedence handled implicitly through the recursive parsing order. The code matches the requirements specified.",
