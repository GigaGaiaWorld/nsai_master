Here are the reports for each code block in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "11FB8FD3",
    "Report": "The code appears to be a valid Problog implementation of the 'SEND + MORE = MONEY' cryptarithmetic puzzle. It correctly defines the constraints for the puzzle including: digit assignments, uniqueness constraints, and the arithmetic relationship. The code follows proper Problog syntax and should work for solving this puzzle.",

}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "9D7ABC12",
    "Report": "The code block is empty, which is causing the 'Empty statement found' error. According to the requirements, this block should contain additional rules to complete query_sum/1. Since it's completely empty, it needs to be regenerated with the appropriate rules.",
