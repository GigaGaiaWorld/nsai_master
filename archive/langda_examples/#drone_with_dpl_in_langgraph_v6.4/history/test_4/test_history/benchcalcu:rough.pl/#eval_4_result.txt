The predicates 'leftdigit' and 'digit' are not defined in this code block\n2. The 'all_different' constraint is not a built-in Problog predicate\n3. The arithmetic expressions and equality constraint (=:=) are not properly formatted for Problog\n4. The error message indicates the grounding failed due to unexpected fact format\n\nThis needs to be rewritten using proper Problog syntax with defined predicates and constraints.",
