Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> blocks in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "11FB8FD3","Code": "leftdigit(S),\n    leftdigit(M),\n    all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\n    D1 is 1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D,\n    D2 is 1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E,\n    Sum is 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y,\n    Sum is D1 + D2."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "9D7ABC12","Code": ""}
```

Note that the second placeholder didn't require any additional code as the first block already completed the entire query_sum/1 predicate. The second <langda> block was just a placeholder for potential additional rules that weren't needed in the final implementation.
