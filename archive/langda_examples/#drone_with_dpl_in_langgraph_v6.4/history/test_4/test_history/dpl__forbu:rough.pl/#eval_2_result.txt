    "Report": "The provided code block only implements the append/3 predicate for list concatenation, which is a helper function but does not implement the required bubblesort/3 algorithm. The error message indicates that the system cannot find clauses for 'bubblesort/3', which confirms the missing implementation. The append/3 predicate itself is correctly implemented but insufficient for the stated requirements.",
