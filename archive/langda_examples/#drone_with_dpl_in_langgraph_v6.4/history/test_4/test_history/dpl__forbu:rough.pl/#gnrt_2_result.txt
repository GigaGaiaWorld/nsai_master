Based on the given instructions, I'll extract and format only the code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code. In this case, the <langda> block was requesting the implementation of the bubblesort/3 algorithm to replace the incomplete part.

Here's the extracted and formatted code:

```prolog
{"HASH": "47D659C8","Code": "% Implement the bubblesort/3 algorithm
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort([H|T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(H, T, NT, Max),
    bubblesort(NT, [Max|Acc], Sorted).

% Helper predicate to perform a single bubble pass
bubble(X, [], [], X).
bubble(X, [Y|T], [X|NT], Max) :-
    X =< Y,
    bubble(Y, T, NT, Max).
bubble(X, [Y|T], [Y|NT], Max) :-
    X > Y,
    bubble(X, T, NT, Max)."}
```
