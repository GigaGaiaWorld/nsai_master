System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n % Problog Inference Result：\nforth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>% Implement the bubblesort/3 algorithm\nbubblesort([], Acc, Acc).\nbubblesort([H|T], Acc, Sorted) :-\n    bubble(H, T, NT, Max),\n    bubblesort(NT, [Max|Acc], Sorted).\n\n% Helper predicate to perform a single bubble pass\nbubble(X, [], [], X).\nbubble(X, [Y|T], [X|NT], Max) :-\n    X =< Y,\n    bubble(Y, T, NT, Max).\nbubble(X, [Y|T], [Y|NT], Max) :-\n    X > Y,\n    bubble(X, T, NT, Max).</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </LLM></Langda>']

Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
