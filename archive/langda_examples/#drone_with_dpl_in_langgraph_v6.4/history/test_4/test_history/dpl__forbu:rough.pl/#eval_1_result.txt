    "Report": "The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog with three main predicates: bubblesort/3, bubble_pass/3, and append/3. The implementation follows the standard bubble sort logic where adjacent elements are compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order. The base cases and recursive cases are correctly defined. However, the error message indicates that the Problog engine cannot find clauses for a certain predicate, likely due to the missing append/3 predicate. The append/3 predicate is essential for concatenating lists but is not defined in the provided code. Additionally, the error suggests there might be an issue with the predicate signature or usage in the Problog environment.",
