Based on the instructions, I'll extract and format only the code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the original code, which was missing the append/3 predicate definition. Here's the extracted and formatted code:

```problog
{"HASH": "47D659C8","Code": "% Define the append predicate for concatenating lists\nappend([], L, L).\nappend([H|T], L, [H|R]) :- append(T, L, R)."}
```

This is the only code block that was added to complete the original <langda> block's missing functionality (the append/3 predicate). The rest of the code in the generated version was already present in the original code.
