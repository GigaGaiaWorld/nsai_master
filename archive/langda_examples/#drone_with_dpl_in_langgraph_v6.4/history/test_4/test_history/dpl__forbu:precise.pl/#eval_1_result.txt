The predicate 'bubble(L,L2,X)' is not defined here, and the recursive call to bubblesort seems to be missing the base case. The code partially meets the requirement of recursively calling bubblesort and building the sorted list, but it needs the full implementation to be valid.",

It properly defines two cases: 'swap(X,Y,swap)' when X > Y (needs swap) and 'swap(X,Y,no_swap)' when X =< Y (no swap needed). This fully meets the requirement of determining whether to exchange elements and is a valid implementation.",
