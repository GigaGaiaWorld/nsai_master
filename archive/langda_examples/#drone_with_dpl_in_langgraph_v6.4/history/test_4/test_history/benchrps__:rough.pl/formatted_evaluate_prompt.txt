System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n Error evaluating Problog model:\n    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call\n    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)\nproblog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for \'play/3\' at 25:1.</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y\nbeats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(scissor, paper).\nbeats(paper, rock).</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: CFA63C1E </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: please define the game rules of rock-paper-scissors. </LLM></Langda>']

Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
