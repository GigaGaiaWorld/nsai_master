    "Report": "The provided code block defines a predicate 'multi_addition' that takes three arguments X, Y, and Z. It converts X and Y to numbers (XNum and YNum) and then computes Z as their sum. However, this code does not fulfill the requirement of parsing an image list from left to right into numbers. The requirement specifically asks for handling lists like [img_3,img_4] to produce 34, but the current code only handles individual numbers and their addition. Additionally, the error message suggests there's a parsing priority clash, likely due to incorrect operator usage or syntax.",
