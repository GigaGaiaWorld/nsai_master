Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Code": "number(X, XNum),\n    number(Y, YNum),\n    Z is XNum + YNum"}
```

Note that this is the exact content that was inside the <Current_Code> tags in the <langda> block, which has been completed in the generated_code (though the completed version remains functionally the same in this case, as the actual list processing logic was implemented in the number/3 predicate rather than changing this particular block).
