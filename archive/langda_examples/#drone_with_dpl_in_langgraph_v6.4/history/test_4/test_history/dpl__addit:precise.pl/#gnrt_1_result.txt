Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section:

```problog
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Code": "multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :-\n    number(X, XNum),\n    number(Y, YNum),\n    Z is XNum + YNum."}
```

Note that I've only included the exact content that would replace the {{LANGDA}} placeholder in the original code, maintaining the exact structure and indentation from the generated code. The extracted code matches the hash tag 4A9D0B2A from the original <langda> block.
