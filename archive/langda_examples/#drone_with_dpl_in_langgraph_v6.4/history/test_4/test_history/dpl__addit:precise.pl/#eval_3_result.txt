    "Report": "The provided code snippet does not fully meet the requirements. The requirement is to parse an image list (e.g., [img_3, img_4]) into a number (e.g., 34). However, the current code only handles individual numbers (X and Y) and performs addition (Z is XNum + YNum). It does not address the parsing of an image list into a number. The code needs to be extended to handle the image list parsing as specified in the requirements.",
