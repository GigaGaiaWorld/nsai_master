The requirements specify parsing an image list from left to right into numbers (e.g., [img_3, img_4] should be parsed into 34). However, the given code snippet only handles individual numbers (X and Y) and performs addition (Z is XNum + YNum). It does not address the image list parsing requirement at all.",
