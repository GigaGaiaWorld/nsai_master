Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Code": "number(X,XNum),\n    number(Y,YNum),\n    Z is XNum + YNum"}
```

Note that I've only included the exact content that was inside the <Current_Code> tags of the <langda> block, as per your instructions. The completed implementation from generated_code (which includes the recursive number/3 predicate) is not included here because it wasn't part of the original <langda> block.
