Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder:

```problog
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Code": "number(X,XNum),\n    number(Y,YNum),\n    Z is XNum + YNum"}
```

This is the exact content that replaced the {{LANGDA}} placeholder in the original code, matching the hash tag provided in the <langda> block. The extracted code implements the required functionality of parsing image lists into numbers and performing addition, addressing the original requirements mentioned in the LLM section.
