    "Report": "The code 'my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)' appears to be a Prolog predicate that checks if a house with specific attributes (yellow color and kools brand) is a member of the list 'Houses'. The underscores represent wildcards for unspecified attributes. The code is syntactically correct for Prolog/DeepProblog, but without seeing the full context or rules it's meant to be part of, it's unclear if it fully meets requirements. The predicate seems to be part of a larger puzzle-solving system (likely the Zebra puzzle given the error context).",
