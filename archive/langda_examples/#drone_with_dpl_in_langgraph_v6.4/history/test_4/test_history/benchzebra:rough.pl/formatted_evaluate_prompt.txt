System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n Error evaluating Problog model:\n    @property\n    \n  File "/Users/zhenzhili/MASTERTHESIS/#Expert_System_Design/examples/LANGDA/#drone_with_dpl_in_langgraph_v6.4/utils/test_tools.py", line 17, in timeout_handler\n    raise TimeoutError(f"Function timed out while processing file: {file_basename}")\nTimeoutError: Function timed out while processing file: benchzebra:rough.pl</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: 0F506A43 </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: please complete the rules </LLM></Langda>']

<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
