    "Report": "The provided code block defines a predicate `game/4` that takes `Cards`, `House`, `H1`, and `H2` as arguments. The predicate checks the cards for both the player and the opponent, calculates the best hand ranks for both, and determines the outcome. However, the error message indicates a parsing issue related to operator priority, which suggests there might be a syntax error in the surrounding code or in how this predicate is being used. The code itself appears logically correct for its intended purpose, but the error suggests it needs to be integrated properly with the rest of the program. The requirement to randomly draw a hole card from `house_rank/1` is not implemented in this snippet.",
