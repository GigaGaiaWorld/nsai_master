    "Report": "The provided code block defines a predicate `game/4` that takes `Cards`, `House`, `H1`, and `H2` as arguments. The predicate checks the cards for both the player and the opponent, determines the best hand rank for each, and then computes the outcome. However, the error message indicates a parsing issue related to operator priority, which suggests there might be a syntax error in the surrounding code or in how this predicate is being used. The current code does not fully meet the requirement of randomly drawing a hole card from the probability distribution `house_rank/1` before calling `game/3`. The code needs to be adjusted to include this random drawing step.",
