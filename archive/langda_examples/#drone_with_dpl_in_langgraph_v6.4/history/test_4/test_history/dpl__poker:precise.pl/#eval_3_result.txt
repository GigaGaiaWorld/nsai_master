    "Report": "The provided code block defines a predicate `game/4` that takes `Cards`, `House`, `H1`, and `H2` as arguments. The predicate checks the cards for both the player and the opponent, determines the best hand ranks for both, and then computes the outcome. However, the error message indicates a parsing issue related to operator priority, which suggests there might be a syntax error in the surrounding code or in how this predicate is being used. The predicate itself appears syntactically correct for Prolog/ProbLog, but the error suggests it's not being called correctly or there's a conflict in the file. The requirement mentions needing to randomly draw a hole card from `house_rank/1` before calling `game/3`, but the provided code is `game/4`, which might indicate a mismatch in the expected arity.",
