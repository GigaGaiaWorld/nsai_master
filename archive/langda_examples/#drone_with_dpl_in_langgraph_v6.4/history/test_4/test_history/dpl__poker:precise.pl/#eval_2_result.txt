Here are the reports for the provided code blocks:

```report
{
    "HASH": "EF02D81B",
    "Report": "The first code block defines a predicate game/3 that correctly implements the required logic. It takes Cards and House as input, retrieves both player's cards using cards/4, calculates their best hand ranks using best_hand_rank/2, and then determines the outcome using outcome/3. The logic matches the requirement of comparing ranks and returning Outcome âˆˆ {win, loss, draw}. The code appears syntactically correct and logically sound for the described purpose.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "C53A4763",
    "Report": "The second code block defines a predicate game/2 that attempts to randomly select a House using house_rank/1 and then calls game/3. However, there appears to be a syntax error in the implementation (as indicated by the ParseError in the test results). The code structure is conceptually correct for the requirements, but needs to be fixed to properly handle the random selection of House and the subsequent game evaluation.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
