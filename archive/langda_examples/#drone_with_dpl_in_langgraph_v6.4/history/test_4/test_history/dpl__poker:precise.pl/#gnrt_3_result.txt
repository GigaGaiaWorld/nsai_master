Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the `<langda>` blocks in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "C53A4763","Code": "game(Cards,House,H1,H2) :-\n    cards(Cards,own,House,H1),\n    cards(Cards,opponent,House,H2),\n    best_hand_rank(H1,R1),\n    best_hand_rank(H2,R2),\n    outcome(R1,R2,Outcome)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "","Code": "game(Cards,House,Outcome) :-\n house_rank(House),\n game(Cards,House,_,_,Outcome)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "","Code": "game(Cards,Outcome) :-\n house_rank(House),\n game(Cards,House,Outcome)."}
```

Note: The second and third blocks don't have hash tags in the original code, so I've left them empty. The first block maintains its original hash tag "C53A4763".
