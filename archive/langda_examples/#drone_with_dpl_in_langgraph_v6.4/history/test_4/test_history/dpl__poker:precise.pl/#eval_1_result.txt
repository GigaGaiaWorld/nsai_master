Here are the reports for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
    "HASH": "D38F9F68",
    "Report": "The code block correctly defines predicates for card distribution and hand evaluation. It takes Cards and House as input, distributes cards to own and opponent, and calculates best hands (H1, H2). However, the implementation of best_hand/2 predicate is missing which could be causing the timeout error. The logic structure is correct but needs the actual hand evaluation implementation.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "EF02D81B",
    "Report": "The code attempts to compare hand ranks and determine game outcome, but has several issues: 1) The game/4 predicate doesn't match the required game/3 in the requirements, 2) OwnCards and OpponentCards are used but not defined in this scope, 3) The outcome/3 predicate logic isn't shown. The structure needs adjustment to properly compare ranks and return win/loss/draw.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "C53A4763",
    "Report": "The code structure is mostly correct but incomplete. It correctly uses house_rank/1 to randomly select a House card, but the game/2 predicate doesn't match the required game/3 from previous blocks. The predicate arity mismatch suggests this won't work with the other code blocks. Needs adjustment to properly connect with the game logic.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
