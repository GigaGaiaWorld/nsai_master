    "Report": "The provided Prolog code correctly implements an insertion sort algorithm. The code consists of three main parts: 1) A base case for an empty list, 2) A recursive case that sorts the tail and then inserts the head into the sorted tail, and 3) An insert predicate that handles the actual insertion of elements into the correct position in a sorted list. The code is valid Prolog and matches the requirements of implementing an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm. The test result shows it correctly sorts [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12] into [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] with 100% probability, confirming its correctness.",
