System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n Error evaluating Problog model:\n    rf = self.fold(\n         ^^^^^^^^^^\n  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1101, in fold\n    raise ParseError(\nproblog.parser.ParseError: Operator priority clash at 10:36.</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    get_top_n(Stack, 3, [A,B,C], Rest),\n    sort([A,B,C], [X,Y,Z]),\n    append([X,Y,Z], Rest, SortedStack).</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6931D64E </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: A custom stack operation: sort, which sorts the three elements at the top of the stack in ascending order and then puts them back to the original stack. </LLM></Langda>']

Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
