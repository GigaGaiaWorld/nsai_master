Here are the reports for the provided code blocks:

```report
{
    "HASH": "E659D458",
    "Report": "The first code block correctly implements a stack push operation in Prolog. The rule 'stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])' takes an element X and a stack, then returns a new stack with X added to the top. This matches the requirement of pushing element X onto the top of the stack and returning the new stack [X|Stack]. The syntax is correct and the implementation is straightforward.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "6931D64E",
    "Report": "The second code block attempts to implement a custom stack sorting operation but contains several issues. The error message indicates an operator priority clash, likely due to syntax problems. While the logic (sorting top 3 elements) matches the requirements, the implementation is problematic. The predicate get_top_n/4 is not defined in the shown code, and there might be issues with the sorting and appending operations. The code needs to be revised to properly handle the stack operations and sorting.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
