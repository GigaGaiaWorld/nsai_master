Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    get_top_n(Stack, 3, [A,B,C], Rest),\n    sort([A,B,C], [X,Y,Z]),\n    append([X,Y,Z], Rest, SortedStack)."}
```

This is the only code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code, which had the hash tag 6931D64E and was marked as needing regeneration. The extracted code is exactly the completed version of what was in the <langda> block's <Current_Code> section.
