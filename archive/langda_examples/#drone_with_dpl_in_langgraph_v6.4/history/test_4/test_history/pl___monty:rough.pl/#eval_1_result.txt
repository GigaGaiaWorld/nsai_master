    "Report": "The code defines the `open_door/1` predicate which correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic. It handles two scenarios: 1) When the player's selected door has the prize (randomly opens one of the two empty doors), and 2) When the player's selected door does not have the prize (host must open the remaining empty door). The code uses `findall` and `random_member` appropriately for the random selection case. However, the error message suggests there might be missing supporting predicates (`select_door/1` and `prize/1`) or their definitions might not be visible in the current context. The core logic of the `open_door/1` predicate itself appears correct.",
