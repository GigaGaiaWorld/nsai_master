System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n % Problog Inference Resultï¼š\nquery_pop([(china, france), (indonesia, pakistan), (pakistan, indonesia), (w_germany, uk), (mexico, ethiopia), (uk, w_germany), (italy, philippines), (france, china), (philippines, italy), (ethiopia, mexico)]) = 1.0000</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>% Calculate population density (population / area)\ndensity(Country, Density) :-\n    pop(Country, Pop),\n    area(Country, Area),\n    Density is Pop / Area.\n\n% Query to find countries with approximately equal population density (not larger than 5%)\nquery_pop(Pairs) :-\n    findall((Country1, Country2), (\n        density(Country1, Density1),\n        density(Country2, Density2),\n        Country1 \\= Country2,\n        abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05\n    ), Pairs).</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: 5738285A </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: define query_pop to query population and area database to find countries of approximately equal population density(not larger than 5%),  you might also need to define density predicate to calculate the density. </LLM></Langda>']

<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
