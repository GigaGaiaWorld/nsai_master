    "Report": "The code correctly implements the required functionality. It defines a 'density' predicate that calculates population density by dividing population by area. The 'query_pop' predicate then finds all pairs of distinct countries where the absolute difference in their densities is not larger than 5% of the first country's density. The code structure is logical and follows Prolog syntax. The test results show it successfully finds country pairs with approximately equal population densities.",
