    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements for calculating the new flap position. It follows the steps: 1) Retrieves previous flap position (Old), 2) Checks if Old is not equal to goal position (GP), 3) Uses an actuator with its strength (AS), 4) Calculates the direction (Sign) and ideal movement (AE), 5) Incorporates wind effect (WE), and 6) Computes the new position (Pos). The logic aligns with the requirements and the Problog results show reasonable probabilities for different outcomes.",
