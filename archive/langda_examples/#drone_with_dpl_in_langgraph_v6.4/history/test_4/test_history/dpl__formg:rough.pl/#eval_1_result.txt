    "Report": "The provided code implements a correct and interpretable merge sort algorithm in Prolog. The code consists of three main predicates: split/3, merge/3, and merge_sort/2. The split/3 predicate correctly divides a list into two halves, which is essential for the merge sort algorithm. The merge/3 predicate correctly merges two sorted lists into one sorted list. The merge_sort/2 predicate recursively splits the input list, sorts the halves, and merges them back together. The base cases are correctly handled for empty lists and single-element lists. The test result shows that the algorithm works as expected, sorting the list [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12] into [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] with a probability of 1.0000, indicating a deterministic and correct implementation.",
