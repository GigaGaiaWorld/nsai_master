Here are the evaluation reports for the provided code blocks in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "95E704F2",
    "Report": "The code block correctly implements all required rules: 1. It gets the length of the list using length/2 predicate. 2. It includes the recursive boundary condition (Len > 1) to determine when to stop splitting. 3. It properly splits the list into Left and Right parts using split_list/3 for recursive processing. The logic matches exactly with the merge sort algorithm requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": "false"
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "26E82D5D",
    "Report": "The code block perfectly implements all specified requirements: 1. It recursively calls merge_sort on the left half (Left) to produce SortedLeft. 2. It recursively sorts the right half (Right) to produce SortedRight. 3. It merges the two sorted sublists (SortedLeft and SortedRight) into the final sorted result (Sorted) using merge/3. The implementation correctly follows the merge sort algorithm's divide-and-conquer approach.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```
