The rules cover: 1) Initial infection with 0.1 probability (0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X)), 2) Contact transmission with different probabilities for susceptible (0.8) and non-susceptible (0.6) individuals, and 3) Additional travel risk with 0.2 probability (0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)). The syntax is valid DeepProblog and matches the described logic.",
