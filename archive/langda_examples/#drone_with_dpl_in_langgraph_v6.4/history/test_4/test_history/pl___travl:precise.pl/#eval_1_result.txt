    "Report": "The code block defines infection rules using probabilistic logic programming. The rules are mostly correct but have some discrepancies with the requirements:\n1. The 'initialInf(X)' rule is missing the required 0.1 probability annotation\n2. The contact transmission rules correctly implement the different probabilities for susceptible vs non-susceptible cases\n3. The riskyTravel rule correctly implements the 0.2 probability\n4. The inference results shown (0.1245 for both a and b) suggest the rules are working but may not reflect the exact intended probabilities due to the missing initial probability",
