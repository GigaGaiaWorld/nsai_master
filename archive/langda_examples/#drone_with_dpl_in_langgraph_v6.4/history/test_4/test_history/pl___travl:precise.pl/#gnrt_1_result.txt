Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here is the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54","Code": "0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\n0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

Note that:
1. I only included the exact content that was inside the <Current_Code> tags in the <langda> block
2. The code has been updated to include the missing 0.1 probability annotation for the initialInf rule
3. The backslash in "\+susceptible(X)" has been properly escaped with an additional backslash
4. The HASH value matches the one provided in the original <langda> block
