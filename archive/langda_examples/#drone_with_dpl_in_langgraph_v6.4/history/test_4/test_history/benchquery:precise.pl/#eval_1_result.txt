Here are the reports for the two code blocks in JSON format:

```report
{
    "HASH": "A37F4273",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the requirements for finding countries with approximately equal population density. It uses the inequality 20×D1 < 21×D2 to approximate D1/D2 < 1.05, which avoids division and decimals as specified. The code also ensures C1 and C2 are different countries (C1 \\= C2). The test results show correct pairings of countries with similar densities, confirming the code works as intended.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "3A3D0149",
    "Report": "The code correctly calculates integer population density using floor division as specified. It multiplies population P by 100 before dividing by area A to maintain precision, then uses integer division (//). This matches the requirements exactly. The calculation method is appropriate for the task and produces correct results when used with the density comparison in the first code block.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
