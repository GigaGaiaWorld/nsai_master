Here are the reports for each code block in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "3F277A35",
    "Report": "The code 'result(X, X, draw) :- move(X).' is syntactically correct and meets the requirement of declaring a draw when both players show the same gesture. The rule is properly defined with the same variable X for both inputs, which correctly implements the 'same gestures are considered a draw' requirement.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "D91BB7A0",
    "Report": "The code 'result(X, Y, win) :- beats(X, Y).' is syntactically correct and properly implements the requirement that if X beats Y, then X wins. The rule structure is appropriate for this logical relationship.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

For the third Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "0940BB04",
    "Report": "The code 'result(X, Y, lose) :- beats(Y, X).' is syntactically correct and correctly implements the requirement that if Y beats X, then X loses. The rule properly inverts the relationship to determine the losing condition.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

Note: The error message shown in the test results appears to be related to operator priority in a different part of the code (not shown in these blocks). The three rules analyzed here are all syntactically correct and properly implement their respective requirements. The error likely comes from elsewhere in the Problog program.
