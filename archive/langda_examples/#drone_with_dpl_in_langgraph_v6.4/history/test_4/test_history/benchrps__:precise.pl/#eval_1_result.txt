Here's the evaluation report for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
    "HASH": "3F277A35",
    "Report": "The code 'move(X).' is too generic and doesn't implement the required rule about same gestures being a draw. It needs to be expanded to define specific moves (rock, paper, scissor) and their comparison logic.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "D91BB7A0",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(X, Y).' is incomplete as it doesn't define the actual winning conditions between moves (rock beats scissor, scissor beats paper, paper beats rock). It needs concrete facts to be useful.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "0940BB04",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(Y, X).' is similarly incomplete as the previous beats predicate. It needs the same concrete facts about move relationships to properly implement the losing condition.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "583E41B6",
    "Report": "The compute_score predicate for 'win' cases is correctly implemented. It properly handles recursive score calculation and increments the score by 1 for player1's win.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "D324979D",
    "Report": "The compute_score predicate for 'lose' cases is correctly implemented. It properly handles recursive score calculation and decrements the score by 1 (equivalent to adding a point to player2).",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "FD850DEC",
    "Report": "The compute_score predicate for 'draw' cases is correctly implemented. It properly handles the case where the score remains unchanged for a draw.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "3FEB17D7",
    "Report": "The main predicate logic is mostly correct but depends on the incomplete play/3 predicate (not shown in the code blocks). The score comparison and winner determination logic is properly implemented.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```
