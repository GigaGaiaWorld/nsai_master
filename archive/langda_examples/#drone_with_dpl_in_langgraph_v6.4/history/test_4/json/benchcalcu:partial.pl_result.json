  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it incorrectly uses 'sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4)' without ensuring 'S' is instantiated before use, leading to a runtime error. Second, the logic for checking 'all_different' is duplicated and misplaced. The original code correctly structures the constraints and ensures variables are instantiated before use. The generated code fails to run due to these problems, while the original code successfully finds a solution."
