  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same functionality for member/2, basic meta-interpreter, and extended logic processing. However, there is a significant difference in the 'implies/2' implementation. The original code allows for P ⇒ Q to be true if P is unprovable or Q is provable, while the generated code requires both P and Q to be provable. Despite this difference, the running results are consistent for the given queries, as the specific queries used do not expose this discrepancy."
