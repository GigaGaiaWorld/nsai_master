  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the bubble sort algorithm and produces the same result as the original code. The main difference is in the implementation approach: the original code uses a 'hole' predicate with swap/no_swap logic, while the generated code uses a more straightforward comparison in the 'bubble' predicate. Both versions correctly sort the list [3,1,2,5,7,12] to [1,2,3,5,7,12]. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, though it uses a different implementation style."
