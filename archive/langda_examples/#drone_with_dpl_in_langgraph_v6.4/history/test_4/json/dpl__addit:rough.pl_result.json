  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to perform addition on these numbers. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as it successfully calculates the sum of two multi-digit numbers represented as lists of images. The result is consistent with expectations, demonstrating that 79 + 312 equals 391. The form and logic of the generated code are valid, and the result is correct."
