  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same sorting result. The main differences are in the formatting and the definition of swap/3. The generated code defines swap conditions directly (X > Y for swap, X =< Y for no_swap) while the original uses negation. Both approaches are correct and yield identical results. The generated code has some irregular indentation but remains syntactically valid."
