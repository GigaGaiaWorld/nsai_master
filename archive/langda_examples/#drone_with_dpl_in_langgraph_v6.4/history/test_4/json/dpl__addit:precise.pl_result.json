  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'multi_addition' that handles multi-digit addition. It correctly implements number construction from digit sequences and performs addition as expected. The code is consistent with the original's style but adds more advanced capabilities. The result (79 + 312 = 391) correctly demonstrates this extended functionality."
