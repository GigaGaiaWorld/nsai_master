Specifically, there are duplicate clauses for the 'result' predicate and malformed predicate definitions with repeated heads and bodies. The 'determine_winner' predicate is also duplicated and incorrectly formatted. These issues prevent the code from running, resulting in a parse error. In contrast, the original code is well-structured and runs correctly, producing the expected output."
