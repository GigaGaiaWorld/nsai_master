  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where the generated code uses integer division and absolute value to calculate the sign, while the original uses the 'sign' function. Despite this difference, both implementations achieve the same mathematical result. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code meets the expected behavior."
