  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but contains some formatting issues (unnecessary line breaks and duplicate probability declarations). The main problem is the duplicate declaration of world probabilities, which affects the results. The running results differ significantly from the original, indicating incorrect probability calculations due to the duplication."
