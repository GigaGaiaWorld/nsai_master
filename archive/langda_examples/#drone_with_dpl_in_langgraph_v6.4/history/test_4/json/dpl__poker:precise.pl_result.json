First, there is a syntax error in the 'game' predicate definition, where the same predicate is defined twice with different bodies, causing a parsing error. Second, the structure of the generated code does not match the original code's logic, particularly in the game outcome determination. The original code correctly computes probabilities for win/loss outcomes, while the generated code fails to execute due to syntax errors."
