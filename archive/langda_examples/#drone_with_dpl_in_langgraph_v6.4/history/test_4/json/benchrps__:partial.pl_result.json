  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. However, there are some formatting issues and a minor syntax error in the 'compute_score' clause for 'draw' cases. The generated code incorrectly omits 'S1' in the 'compute_score([draw | Rs], S)' clause, which should be 'compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1'. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output."
