  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes solve the cryptoaddition problem and produce the same correct result. However, the generated code has some redundant lines and comments that do not affect the outcome but make the code less clean. Specifically, the sumdigit(0, D, E, Y, C1) predicate is called twice, and there are some unnecessary comments and line breaks. Despite these minor issues, the generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
