  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it incorrectly places the house attributes in different positions compared to the original code (e.g., color and drink are swapped in some predicates). Second, the rule for orange juice and Lucky Strikes is incorrectly implemented as a separate clause instead of a single predicate. Third, the generated code does not produce a concrete solution like the original code, instead returning uninstantiated variables. The structure of the generated code is similar but contains logical errors that prevent it from solving the puzzle correctly."
