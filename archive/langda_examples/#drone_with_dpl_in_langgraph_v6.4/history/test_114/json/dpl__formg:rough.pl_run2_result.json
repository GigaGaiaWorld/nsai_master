  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. Both codes handle base cases and recursive sorting by splitting, sorting, and merging lists. The generated code uses a different splitting method (pairwise splitting) compared to the original (length-based splitting), but both achieve the same result. The merge and append functions are identical in both codes. The running results are consistent, producing the correct sorted list."
