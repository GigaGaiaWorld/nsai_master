  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog and produce the same correct result. However, the generated code has some formatting issues, such as unnecessary line breaks and inconsistent indentation, which do not affect the execution but make the code less readable. The logic and structure of the generated code remain intact, ensuring it meets the requirements."
