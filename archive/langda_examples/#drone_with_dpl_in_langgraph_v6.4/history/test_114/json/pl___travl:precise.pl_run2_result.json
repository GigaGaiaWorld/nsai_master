  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and rules. However, there is a critical difference in the order of the rules for 'inf(X)'. In the original code, the rule 'inf(X) :- initialInf(X).' is placed before the probabilistic rules, while in the generated code, it is placed after. This change affects the probability calculation, leading to different results. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results due to the altered rule order."
