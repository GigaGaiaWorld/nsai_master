  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of parsing logic. The original code correctly handles operator precedence and evaluates the expression to -10.333, while the generated code evaluates it to 11.666 due to incorrect parsing rules. The generated code's parse/2 rules do not properly account for operator precedence and associativity, leading to a different result. The form of the generated code is valid, but the logic is flawed."
