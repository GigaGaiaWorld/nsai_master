  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'split' function, which is more concise in the generated code compared to the original 'split_list' function. Both codes produce the same correct result for the given query. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, with no apparent issues."
