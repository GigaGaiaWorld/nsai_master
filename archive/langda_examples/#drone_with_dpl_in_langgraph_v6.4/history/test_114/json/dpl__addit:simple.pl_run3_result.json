  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define digit facts and an addition predicate that sums the digits of two images. The generated code uses different variable names (A, B instead of X2, Y2) in the addition predicate, but this does not affect the logic or outcome. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sum for the query addition(img_5,img_6,Z)."
