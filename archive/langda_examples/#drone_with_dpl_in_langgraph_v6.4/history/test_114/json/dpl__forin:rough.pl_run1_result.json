  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement insertion sort in Prolog with identical logic. The generated code renames the 'insert_element' predicate to 'insert', but this does not affect the functionality. The query and the result are the same in both cases, producing the correct sorted list. There are no problems with the generated code."
