  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve the same cryptarithmetic puzzle as the original code but introduces several issues. It adds an arithmetic check (SEND + MORE =:= MONEY) which is conceptually correct but implemented incorrectly, leading to a runtime error. The main problem is in the sumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, _) call where the arguments are not properly grounded, causing the 'is/2' error. The original code correctly solves the puzzle without this arithmetic check by relying solely on constraint propagation. The generated code's structure is similar but flawed in execution."
