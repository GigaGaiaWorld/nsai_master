  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic and produces results consistent with the original code. It simplifies the door opening rules by combining both random and deterministic cases into a single predicate, making the code more concise while maintaining the same probabilistic behavior. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
