  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a redundant and incorrect clause 'result(X, X, draw).' which duplicates the original rule without the necessary 'move(X)' condition. This could lead to logical inconsistencies. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output for the given query."
