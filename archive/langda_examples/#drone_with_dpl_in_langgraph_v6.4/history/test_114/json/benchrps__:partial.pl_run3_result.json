  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues. First, the generated code uses 'scissors' instead of 'scissor' in the move/1 predicate, which is inconsistent with the original code. Second, the compute_score/2 predicate for draw cases is incorrect as it does not properly compute the score (it misses the S1 variable). Despite these issues, the running results of both codes are consistent."
