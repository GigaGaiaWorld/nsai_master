  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally different from the original code but attempts to achieve the same functionality. It introduces new predicates like parse_add_sub and parse_mul_div to handle arithmetic operations, which is a valid approach. However, the generated code fails to produce the correct result for the given query, returning a probability of 0.0000 instead of the expected -10.333333333333332. This indicates a logical error in the implementation of the parsing rules."
