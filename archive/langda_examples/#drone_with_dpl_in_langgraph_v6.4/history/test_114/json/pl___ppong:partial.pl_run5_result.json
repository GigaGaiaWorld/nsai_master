  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. The logic and structure of the generated code match the original code, including the probabilistic rules, team strength calculation, and win conditions. The only differences are minor formatting changes, such as line breaks and spacing, which do not affect the functionality or results. Both pieces of code produce identical run results, confirming their equivalence."
