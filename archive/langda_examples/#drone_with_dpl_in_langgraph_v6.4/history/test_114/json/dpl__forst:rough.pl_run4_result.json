  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect. It lacks definitions for several stack operations (pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that were present in the original code. As a result, queries for these operations fail (returning 0.0000 probability). The generated code only includes the 'push' and 'sort' operations, making it inconsistent with the original code. The form is valid Prolog syntax, but it doesn't meet the requirements of replicating all original functionality."
