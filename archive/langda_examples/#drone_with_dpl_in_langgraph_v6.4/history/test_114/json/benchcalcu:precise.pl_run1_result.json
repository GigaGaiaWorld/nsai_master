  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, it contains redundant lines and comments that do not affect the logic but make the code less clean. Specifically, the sumdigit(0, D, E, Y, C1) and sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M) predicates are duplicated. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code meets the expected requirements."
