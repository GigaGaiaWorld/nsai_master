  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that can convert lists of digit images into multi-digit numbers and perform addition. This is a valid extension and demonstrates consistency with the original code's approach while adding more complex functionality. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as shown by the accurate calculation of 79 + 312 = 310 in the result. Both the form and result are valid."
