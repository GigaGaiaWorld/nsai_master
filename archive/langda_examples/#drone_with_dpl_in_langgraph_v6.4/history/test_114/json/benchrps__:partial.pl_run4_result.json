  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues. First, the gesture 'scissor' is misspelled as 'scissors' in the move/1 predicate, which could cause inconsistency. Second, the compute_score/2 predicate for draw cases incorrectly passes S1 directly instead of assigning it to S. Despite these issues, the running results are consistent with the original code."
