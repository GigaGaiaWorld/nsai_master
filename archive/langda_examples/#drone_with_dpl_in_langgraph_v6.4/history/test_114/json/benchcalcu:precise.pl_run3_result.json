  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code and produces the same result. However, it contains redundant lines and comments that do not affect the execution but make the code less clean. The core logic, constraints, and digit assignments remain consistent between both versions. The generated code correctly solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle with the same output as the original."
