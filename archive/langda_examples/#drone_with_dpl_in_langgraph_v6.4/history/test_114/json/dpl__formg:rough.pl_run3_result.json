  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in Problog, similar to the original code. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'split' function, which in the generated code uses a different approach to split the list into two halves. The generated code is consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and produces the same correct result. However, the generated code includes an unnecessary duplicate query and append definition at the end, which does not affect the result but is redundant."
