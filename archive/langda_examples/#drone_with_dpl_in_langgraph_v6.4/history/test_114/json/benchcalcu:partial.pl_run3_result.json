  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues compared to the original code. First, the sumdigit(C2, E, N, N, C3) line incorrectly uses N twice instead of O, which breaks the logic of the cryptarithmetic puzzle. Second, the generated code introduces a new variable C4 without proper handling, unlike the original code which correctly uses M as both a digit and a carry check. These logical errors cause the generated code to fail to find a valid solution, resulting in a probability of 0.0000 instead of the correct solution found by the original code."
