  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally consistent with the original code, maintaining the same predicates and probabilistic rules. However, the running results differ significantly (0.1245 vs 0.0316) due to a change in the probability of the 'inf(X) :- initialInf(X)' rule from 0.1 in the original to 0.1 in the generated code (no change noted here, but results suggest an underlying discrepancy). The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results, likely due to an unobserved modification or external factor."
