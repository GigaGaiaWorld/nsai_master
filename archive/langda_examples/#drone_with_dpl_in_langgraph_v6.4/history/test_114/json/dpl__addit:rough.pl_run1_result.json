  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that can handle lists of images to form multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate that adds these multi-digit numbers. This is a valid extension of the original concept and works correctly as demonstrated by the result. The generated code is consistent with the original in terms of style and approach, but adds more complex functionality. No problems are identified."
