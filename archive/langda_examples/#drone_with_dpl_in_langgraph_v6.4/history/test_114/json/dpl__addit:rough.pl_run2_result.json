  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to perform addition on these numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly processes lists of images representing digits and performs the addition accurately. The running results of both codes are consistent with their respective queries, demonstrating correct behavior."
