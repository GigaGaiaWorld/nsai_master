  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the original logic by changing the density comparison to a 5% threshold instead of the original 20-21 ratio. While the generated code is valid and produces results, it does not strictly adhere to the original code's logic. The results differ in format and content, with the generated code returning pairs of countries with their names rather than densities, and including reciprocal pairs (e.g., (A,B) and (B,A))."
