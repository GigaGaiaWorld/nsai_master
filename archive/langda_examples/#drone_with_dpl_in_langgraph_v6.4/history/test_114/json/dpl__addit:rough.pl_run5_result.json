  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of digit images into their corresponding numerical values and performs addition on these numbers. This is a valid extension of the original concept, maintaining consistency with the original code's approach while adding more complex functionality. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as demonstrated by the successful execution showing the addition of 79 and 312 to get 391. Both the form and result are valid."
