  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it introduces a new predicate 'split_lowest_precedence/4' which is not defined, leading to a runtime error. This predicate was not present in the original code, which used a different approach to parse expressions. The original code correctly implements arithmetic operations through specific parse rules for each operator, while the generated code attempts a more general approach but fails due to the missing predicate. The running results are inconsistent because the generated code does not execute successfully."
