  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement insertion sort in Prolog with identical logic. The generated code uses slightly different predicate names ('insert' instead of 'insert_element') but maintains the same behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
