  "final_report": "The generated code is missing the 'query_pop' predicate definition, which is present in the original code. This causes the error when trying to run the generated code. The original code defines 'query_pop' to find countries with approximately equal population density, while the generated code only includes the 'density' predicate and data but lacks the main query logic. The generated code is therefore incomplete and inconsistent with the original code."
