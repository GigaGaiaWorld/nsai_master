System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Requirements>Should contain following rules: 1.Get the length of the current list, Len, to determine whether to continue splitting. 2.Recursive boundary judgment: Only lists with a length greater than 1 need to be sorted, otherwise they are sorted by default. 3.Split the list into two parts, Left and Right, for subsequent recursive processing. </Requirements></Langda>

 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test result shows that it correctly sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the given test case. However, there are minor issues in the implementation that could lead to inefficiencies or incorrect behavior in edge cases. 
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Splitting Logic Issue**: The `split_list` predicate splits the list into two parts, but the current implementation may not handle odd-length lists optimally. The `append` predicate is used to split the list, which is correct but could be simplified for clarity.
2. **Redundant `append` Definition**: The `append` predicate is defined in the code, but it is already a built-in predicate in ProbLog. This redundancy is unnecessary and could cause confusion.
3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The code does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element, though the test case shows it works correctly for these scenarios.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "95E704F2",
        "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: 
        1. It calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine whether to continue splitting.
        2. It includes a recursive boundary check (`Len > 1`).
        3. It splits the list into `Left` and `Right` for recursive processing.
        However, the splitting logic could be optimized for clarity, and the redundant `append` definition should be removed."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Optimize `split_list`**: Replace the `append`-based splitting logic with a direct list-splitting approach for better clarity and efficiency. For example:
   

2. **Remove Redundant `append`**: Delete the custom `append` predicate since it is already built into ProbLog.
3. **Explicit Edge Cases**: Although the code handles edge cases implicitly, explicitly documenting them in comments or assertions can improve readability and maintainability.
4. **Additional Testing**: Test the code with more edge cases (e.g., empty lists, lists with odd lengths) to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
