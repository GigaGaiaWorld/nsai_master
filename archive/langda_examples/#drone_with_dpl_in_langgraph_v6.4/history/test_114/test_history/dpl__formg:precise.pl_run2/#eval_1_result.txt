{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: 1. It calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine if further splitting is needed. 2. It includes a boundary check (`Len > 1`) to avoid unnecessary splitting for small lists. 3. It splits the list into `Left` and `Right` for recursive processing. However, the `split_list` predicate uses `append` to split the list, which is inefficient. A better approach would be to directly split the list without using `append`.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

It merges the sorted sublists (`SortedLeft` and `SortedRight`) into the final result (`Sorted`).
