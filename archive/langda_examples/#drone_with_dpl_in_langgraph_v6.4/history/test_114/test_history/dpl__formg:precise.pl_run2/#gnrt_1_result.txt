Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks that correspond to the <langda> blocks in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "length(List, Len),\n    Len > 1,\n    split_list(List, Left, Right)"}
```

Note: There was only one <langda> block in the origin_code, so only one JSON object is generated. The code block matches exactly with the one marked by the hash "95E704F2" in the origin_code's requirements section. The generated_code shows an improved version of split_list using split_at instead of append, but this wasn't part of the original <langda> block's requirements.
