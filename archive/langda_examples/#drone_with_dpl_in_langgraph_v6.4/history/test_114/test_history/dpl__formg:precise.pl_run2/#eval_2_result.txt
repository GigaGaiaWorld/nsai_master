  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: 1. It calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine whether to continue splitting. 2. It includes a recursive boundary check (`Len > 1`). 3. It splits the list into `Left` and `Right` for recursive processing. However, the splitting logic could be optimized for clarity, and the redundant `append` definition should be removed. The block does not need regeneration as it functionally meets the requirements, but improvements are recommended for clarity and efficiency.",
