Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The origin_code had one <langda> block requesting the game rules of rock-paper-scissors, which appears to be already present in both the origin and generated code (the move/1 and beats/2 predicates).

Here's the extracted code in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "move(rock).\nmove(paper).\nmove(scissor).\nbeats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(scissor, paper).\nbeats(paper, rock)."}
```

Note: The generated_code didn't actually add any new content that wasn't already in the origin_code for this particular placeholder. The basic game rules were already present before the <langda> block in the origin_code.
