  "Report": "The second part of the code defines the `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates. While these are syntactically correct, they are incomplete because the `play/3` predicate, which is required to generate the results for each move, is missing. This omission causes the entire logic to fail during testing. The code block needs regeneration to include the missing `play/3` predicate and ensure proper integration with the rest of the logic.",
