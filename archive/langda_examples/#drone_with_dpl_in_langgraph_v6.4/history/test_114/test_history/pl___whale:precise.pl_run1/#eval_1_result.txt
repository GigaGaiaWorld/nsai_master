  "Report": "The `abandon(S,O)` predicate is correctly implemented to match the requirements, but it lacks a closing period (`.`). Additionally, the predicate only checks for the adult sperm whale at position `c`, which might not cover all abandonment scenarios (e.g., if the adult is at position `b`). The test results show correct probabilities for the given scenarios, but the logic could be more comprehensive. The syntax issue is minor and can be fixed without regeneration, but the logical limitation suggests a need for regeneration to handle all possible abandonment scenarios.",
