Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> placeholder:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)."}
```

This is the only code block that was generated to replace the <Langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The code implements the requirement specified in the placeholder - it defines when an adult sperm whale abandons the calf based on the genders of the adult sperm whale and orca, and the position of the adult sperm whale.
