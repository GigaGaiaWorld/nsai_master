  "Report": "The `density/2` predicate is correctly implemented to calculate population density using `pop/2` and `area/2`. However, it is not integrated into any query or comparison logic, rendering it unused in the current implementation. The requirements specify the need for a `query_pop/1` predicate to find countries with approximately equal population densities, which is missing. While the `density/2` predicate itself is correct, it needs to be utilized within the `query_pop/1` predicate to meet the requirements.",
