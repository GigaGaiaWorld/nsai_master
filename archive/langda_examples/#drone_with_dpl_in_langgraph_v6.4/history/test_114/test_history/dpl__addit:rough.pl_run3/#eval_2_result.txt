  "Report": "The `number` predicate uses the `->` operator, which is not supported in Problog, leading to an 'Unknown Clause' error. The logic for converting a list of image IDs to an integer is conceptually correct but needs to be implemented using Problog-compatible syntax. Additionally, the predicate lacks proper error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-digit images). Recommendations: 1) Replace the `->` operator with Problog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., separate clauses or `if-then-else`), 2) Add clauses to handle invalid inputs gracefully, 3) Test thoroughly after fixes.",
