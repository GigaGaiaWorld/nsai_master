Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the <generated_code> that correspond to the <langda> block in the <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "06576BEB", "Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :-\n    digit(H, D),\n    number(T, N1),\n    N is N1 * 10 + D.\nnumber([H|_], _) :-\n    \\+ digit(H, _),\n    fail."}
```

This JSON contains:
1. The original HASH from the <langda> block
2. The completed implementation of the `number` predicate from <generated_code>, which:
   - Uses Problog-compatible syntax (no `->` operator)
   - Includes proper handling of invalid inputs
   - Maintains the same core logic for converting image lists to numbers
