Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in the original code:

```report
{"HASH": "7E335295", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world 'c' where whale 1 is at position 'b'. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "10EB99E1", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world 'c' where whale 2 is at position 'c'. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "A0236B75", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world 'c' where whale 2 is male (bull). No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "459D5246", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world 'c' where whale 3 is female (cow). No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "FA3ABC35", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world 'd' where whale 1 is at position 'b'. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "E19272CE", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world 'd' where whale 2 is at position 'c'. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "1C6CAA4A", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world 'd' where whale 2 is male (bull). No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "7C3E979C", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world 'd' where whale 3 is male (bull). No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "F46C6231", "Report": "The code block correctly defines a uniform distribution over the six worlds. However, it is redundant as it appears twice in the code. Recommend removing the duplicate.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": []}
```

### Summary:
- All code blocks except `F46C6231` are correct and do not need regeneration.
- The block with `HASH: F46C6231` should be regenerated to remove redundancy (it appears twice in the code).
- No dependencies exist between these blocks.
