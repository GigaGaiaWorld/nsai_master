  "Report": "The `addition` predicate is logically correct but suffers from a syntax error ('Operator priority clash') due to improper formatting. The predicate definition is not correctly integrated into the ProbLog syntax, likely missing a period or having incorrect line breaks. The logic itself (retrieving digit values and performing addition) is sound and meets the requirements. The error prevents testing, but the core logic does not need regenerationâ€”only proper formatting fixes.",
