Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "6E46AD63", "Code": "% Predicate to perform addition of two digits represented by images\n% X: First image\n% Y: Second image\n% Z: Result of addition (A + B)\naddition(X, Y, Z) :-\n    digit(X, A),\n    digit(Y, B),\n    Z is A + B."}
```

This is the only code block that was needed to replace the <langda> section in the original code. The JSON includes:
1. The original HASH tag from the <langda> block
2. The completed code snippet that implements the addition predicate
3. Proper formatting with line breaks preserved
