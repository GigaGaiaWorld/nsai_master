  "Report": "The `addition` predicate is syntactically incorrect and improperly formatted, leading to a parsing error ('Operator priority clash'). The logic for addition (extracting digits and computing their sum) is conceptually correct, but the implementation fails due to syntax issues. The predicate definition is split across lines without proper termination or indentation, and the body is ambiguous in operator precedence. The code block needs regeneration to fix these syntax errors and ensure proper integration with the `digit` facts.",
