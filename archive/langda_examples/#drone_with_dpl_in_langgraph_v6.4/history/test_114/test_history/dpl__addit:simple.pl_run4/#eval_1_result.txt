    "Report": "The code block for the addition predicate is logically correct and adheres to the requirements. The test results confirm it produces the correct output (11 for img_5 + img_6). However, the formatting is inconsistent (predicate split across lines without clear indentation) and lacks comments/documentation. While functionally correct, regeneration is recommended to improve readability and maintainability through consistent formatting and added comments.",
    "Need_regenerate": true,
    "Dependencies": []
}
``` 

**Reasoning for regeneration:**
1. **Functional Correctness**: Passes all tests (100% success in given case)
2. **Requirements Met**: Fully implements addition logic with img_X inputs
3. **Issues**: Purely stylistic/readability (formatting, comments)
4. **Dependencies**: None - operates independently of other code blocks
5. **Regeneration Value**: High - minor changes would significantly improve code quality without risking functionality

The regeneration should focus on:
- Consistent indentation
- Single-line predicate definition (or properly aligned multi-line)
- Added inline comments explaining the unification and arithmetic
- No logical changes required
