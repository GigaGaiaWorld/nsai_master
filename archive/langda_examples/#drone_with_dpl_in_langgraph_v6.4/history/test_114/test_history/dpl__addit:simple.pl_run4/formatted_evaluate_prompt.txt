System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1101, in fold
    raise ParseError(
problog.parser.ParseError: Operator priority clash at 17:19.</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code aims to perform addition on digits represented by images (e.g., `img_1` to `img_0`). While the logic for the `addition` predicate is correctly implemented, the code contains a syntax error that prevents it from being parsed and executed. The test results indicate a parsing error due to an operator priority clash, which suggests an issue with the structure of the code.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Error**: The code fails to parse due to an "Operator priority clash" at line 17, column 19. This is likely caused by incorrect formatting or missing delimiters in the code.
2. **Logical Correctness**: The logic for the `addition` predicate is correct, as it retrieves the numeric values of the images and performs the addition. However, the syntax error prevents it from being tested.
3. **Integration**: The `digit` facts and the `addition` predicate are properly integrated, but the syntax error disrupts the overall functionality.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6E46AD63",
        "Report": "The `addition` predicate is logically correct, but the code block is not properly formatted. The predicate definition is split into two parts, and the second part is not correctly integrated into the ProbLog syntax. The error message indicates a parsing issue, likely due to missing or misplaced delimiters (e.g., a missing period or incorrect line breaks)."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax Errors**: Ensure the `addition` predicate is correctly formatted with proper delimiters (e.g., a period at the end of the predicate definition). For example:
   

2. **Test the Code**: After fixing the syntax, test the code with the provided query (`query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).`) to verify that it produces the correct result (`Z = 11`).
3. **Code Structure**: Ensure all predicates and facts are properly separated and terminated with periods to avoid parsing errors.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
