  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has significant logical errors. It incorrectly assigns a 50% probability to each remaining door when there are two empty doors, regardless of whether one has a prize. This violates the Monty Hall problem's rules where the host must deterministically open the empty door if one of the remaining doors has a prize. The `findall/3` call also fails to exclude the prize door, leading to incorrect behavior. The predicate needs to be rewritten to correctly implement the host's behavior, ensuring deterministic opening of the empty door when applicable and proper exclusion of the prize door in the `findall/3` call.",
