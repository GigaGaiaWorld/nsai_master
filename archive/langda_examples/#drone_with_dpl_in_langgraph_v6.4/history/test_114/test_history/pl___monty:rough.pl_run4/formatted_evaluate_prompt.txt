<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The code aims to model the Monty Hall problem in ProbLog, where a player selects a door, and the host opens another door based on specific rules. The test results show that the probabilities for `prize/1`, `prize/2`, and `prize/3` are correctly distributed (0.3333 each), and `select_door(1)` is deterministic (1.0000). However, the `win_switch` probability is 0.0000, which is incorrect for the Monty Hall problem (it should be higher than `win_keep`). This indicates a logical flaw in the implementation of the `open_door/1` predicate or its integration with the rest of the code.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Logical Error in `open_door/1`**: The predicate does not correctly implement the host's behavior when there are two empty doors. The current implementation incorrectly assigns a 50% probability to each door, even when one of them has a prize.
2. **Integration Issue**: The `win_switch` predicate relies on `open_door/1`, but the flawed logic in `open_door/1` causes `win_switch` to always fail (0.0000 probability).
3. **Syntax Issue**: The `member/2` predicate is defined but not used correctly in the `open_door/1` predicate, leading to potential confusion.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "592D75CA",
        "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate does not correctly handle the case where there are two empty doors. The host should deterministically open the empty door if one of the remaining doors has a prize. The current implementation incorrectly assigns a 50% probability to each door, regardless of whether one has a prize. Additionally, the `findall/3` call does not exclude the prize door, which is a logical error."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix `open_door/1`**:
   - Modify the predicate to deterministically open the empty door when one of the remaining doors has a prize.
   - Ensure the `findall/3` call correctly excludes the prize door.
   - Example correction:
     

2. **Test `win_switch`**:
   - After fixing `open_door/1`, re-evaluate the `win_switch` predicate to ensure it reflects the correct probability (should be higher than `win_keep`).
3. **Clarify `member/2` Usage**:
   - Ensure the `member/2` predicate is used consistently and correctly throughout the code.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
