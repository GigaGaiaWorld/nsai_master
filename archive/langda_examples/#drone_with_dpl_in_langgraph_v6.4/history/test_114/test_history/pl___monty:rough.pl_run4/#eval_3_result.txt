  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has the following issues:\n1. Incorrect usage of the conditional operator `->` in ProbLog syntax. ProbLog does not support this operator directly; probabilistic choices should use `::`.\n2. Undefined `door_choice/2` predicate required for 50% probability door selection.\n3. Overly complex logic with unnecessary `findall` and `length` checks for deterministic door opening.\n4. Does not fully implement requirements for deterministic (must open empty door) and random (50% probability) scenarios.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Replace `->` with proper ProbLog probabilistic syntax.\n2. Define `door_choice/2` for random selection.\n3. Simplify logic by directly handling the two scenarios without intermediate checks.\n4. Ensure strict adherence to specified requirements for host behavior.",

  "Report": "The remaining code (prize/1, select_door/1, member/2, win_keep, win_switch, and queries) has these issues:\n1. `win_keep` and `win_switch` depend on the broken `open_door/1`.\n2. While syntactically correct, the queries won't work properly due to predicate issues.\n3. The member/2 predicate is correctly defined but underutilized.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Fix `open_door/1` first (HASH 592D75CA) as this is a dependency.\n2. After fixing dependencies, verify `win_keep`/`win_switch` logic.\n3. Queries are correct but need working predicates to be meaningful.",
