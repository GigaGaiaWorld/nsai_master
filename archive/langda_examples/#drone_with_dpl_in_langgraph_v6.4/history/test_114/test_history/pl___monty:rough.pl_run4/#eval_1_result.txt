  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has significant issues that require regeneration. Key problems include: 1) Invalid ProbLog syntax for conditional logic (`->` operator not supported), 2) Incorrect implementation of deterministic/probabilistic cases (host behavior doesn't match Monty Hall rules), 3) Incompatible use of Prolog predicates (`findall`/`member`) in probabilistic context. The code fails to properly handle the 50% probability requirement when host has choice between two empty doors. The test failure confirms these implementation issues.",
