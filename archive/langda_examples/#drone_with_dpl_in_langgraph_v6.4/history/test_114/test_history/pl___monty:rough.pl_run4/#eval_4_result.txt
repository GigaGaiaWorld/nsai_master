  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has critical issues: (1) It references an undefined predicate `door_choice/2`, causing execution failure. (2) The logic for handling deterministic vs probabilistic door opening is incomplete. (3) While the `findall/3` call correctly identifies empty doors, the subsequent branching logic doesn't fully implement the requirements. The predicate needs to be regenerated to: (a) Include proper probabilistic handling via a defined `door_choice/2` or equivalent mechanism, (b) Clearly separate deterministic and probabilistic cases, and (c) Ensure correct integration with the rest of the Monty Hall simulation.",
