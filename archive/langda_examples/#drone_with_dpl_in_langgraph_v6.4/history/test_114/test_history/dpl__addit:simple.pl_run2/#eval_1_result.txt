However, there are minor issues: (1) The predicate lacks a closing period (`.`), (2) The `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags are not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed or replaced with comments. The core logic does not need regeneration as it works correctly, but the formatting should be cleaned up.",
