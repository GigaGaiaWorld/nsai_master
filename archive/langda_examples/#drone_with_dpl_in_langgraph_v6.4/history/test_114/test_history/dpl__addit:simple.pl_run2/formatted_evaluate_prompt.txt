System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A + B</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6E46AD63 </HASH>
<Requirements>addition logic, input as img_1 to img_0 </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is a simple ProbLog program designed to perform addition on digits represented by images (img_1 to img_0). The test result shows that the addition logic works correctly for the given query, producing the expected output. However, there are minor syntactic and structural issues in the code that need to be addressed for better clarity and correctness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Issue**: The `addition` predicate is not properly closed with a period (`.`) at the end of its definition.
2. **Structural Issue**: The `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags are not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed or replaced with comments if they are meant for documentation.
3. **Redundant Tags**: The `<HASH>` and `<Requirements>` tags are not part of ProbLog syntax and should be removed or formatted as comments.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6E46AD63",
        "Report": "The `addition` predicate is syntactically correct but lacks a closing period (`.`). Additionally, the `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags are not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed. The logic itself is correct and matches the requirements."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Remove or replace the non-ProbLog tags (`<Langda>`, `<Code_Block>`, `<HASH>`, `<Requirements>`) with comments if they are meant for documentation.
2. Add a closing period (`.`) at the end of the `addition` predicate definition.
3. Ensure the code is clean and free of any non-ProbLog syntax to avoid confusion or errors during execution.
4. If the tags are part of a larger system, consider separating the ProbLog code from the metadata to maintain clarity.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
