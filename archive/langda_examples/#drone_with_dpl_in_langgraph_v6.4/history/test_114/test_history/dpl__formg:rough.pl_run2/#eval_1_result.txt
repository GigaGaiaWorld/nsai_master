The `query` statement is not standard ProbLog syntax; it should be replaced with a proper query format, such as `?- merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X).` for compatibility with ProbLog interpreters. This code block needs regeneration to align with standard ProbLog practices and to remove unnecessary predicates.",
