Here is the structured evaluation report for the given code blocks:

```report
{"HASH": "418D2062","Report": "The merge sort implementation is logically correct and fulfills the requirements. The predicates `split/3`, `merge/3`, and `merge_sort/2` are well-defined and produce the correct output. However, the code could benefit from better organization and clarity. The misplaced `query` statement should be integrated into the main code block or documented separately. No regeneration is needed for the core logic, but minor cleanup is recommended.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "N/A (for the misplaced `append/3` and `query`)","Report": "The `append/3` predicate is redundant and unused in the merge sort logic. The `query` statement is misplaced and should not appear after the main code block. This could lead to confusion or errors in larger programs. Regeneration is recommended to remove the redundant `append/3` and properly place the `query` statement.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
``` 

### Key Observations:
1. The core merge sort implementation (HASH `418D2062`) is correct and does not require regeneration.
2. The redundant `append/3` and misplaced `query` are not part of the main code block's hash and should be regenerated or removed.
3. No dependencies exist between these code blocks.
