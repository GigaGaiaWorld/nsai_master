System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>% Merge Sort in ProbLog

% Base case for splitting a list into two halves
split([], [], []).
split([X], [X], []).
split([X,Y|Xs], [X|Left], [Y|Right]) :-
    split(Xs, Left, Right).

% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X|Left], [Y|Right], [X|Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Left, [Y|Right], Merged).
merge([X|Left], [Y|Right], [Y|Merged]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X|Left], Right, Merged).

% Merge sort implementation
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

% Example query
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 418D2062 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable merge_sort/2 algorithm </Requirements></Langda>
.
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, and the test results confirm that it correctly sorts the input list. However, there are some syntactical and logical inconsistencies in the code, such as redundant or misplaced code blocks. The test results show the expected output, but the code could be improved for clarity and correctness." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "The main issues include:
1. Redundant `append/3` predicate definition that is not used in the merge sort logic.
2. Misplaced `query` statement outside the main code block.
3. The `merge_sort/2` implementation is correct but could be optimized for readability." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "418D2062",
        "Report": "The merge sort implementation is logically correct and matches the requirements. The predicates `split/3`, `merge/3`, and `merge_sort/2` are well-defined and work as expected. However, the `query` statement is misplaced and should be part of the main code block or documented separately."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for the misplaced `append/3` and `query`)",
        "Report": "The `append/3` predicate is redundant and unused in the merge sort logic. Additionally, the `query` statement is misplaced and should not appear after the main code block. This could lead to confusion or errors in larger programs."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"To improve the code:
1. Remove the redundant `append/3` predicate.
2. Place the `query` statement within the main code block or document it separately.
3. Consider adding comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate for better readability.
4. Ensure all code blocks are properly integrated and free of unused or misplaced elements." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
