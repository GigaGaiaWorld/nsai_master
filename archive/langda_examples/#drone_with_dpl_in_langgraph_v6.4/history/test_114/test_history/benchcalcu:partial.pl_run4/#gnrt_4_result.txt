Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<Langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C2, E, N, E, C3),\n\ndigit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n\ndigit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\nsumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, 0)."}
```

Note that:
1. I've used the same HASH tag that was provided in the original `<Langda>` block (1039E900)
2. The code block is exactly what was generated to replace the incomplete section in the original code
3. I've preserved all the line breaks and formatting from the generated code
