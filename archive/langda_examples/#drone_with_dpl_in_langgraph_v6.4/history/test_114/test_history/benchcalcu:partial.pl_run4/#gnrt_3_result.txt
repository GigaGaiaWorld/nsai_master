Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<Langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C2, E, N, E, C3),\n\ndigit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n\ndigit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\nsumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, 0)."}
```

Note: I noticed there was a potential error in the original code where `sumdigit(C2, E, N, O, C3)` was written as `sumdigit(C2, E, N, E, C3)` in the generated code (the fourth argument changed from O to E). This might be intentional to fix the original code's issues, but I've preserved what was in the generated code.
