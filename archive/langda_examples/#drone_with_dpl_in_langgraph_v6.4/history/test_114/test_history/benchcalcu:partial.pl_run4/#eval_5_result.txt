  "HASH": "1039E900",
  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and contains critical errors. The `sumdigit` predicate incorrectly uses non-ground arguments in arithmetic operations (`is/2`), which violates ProbLog's requirement for ground terms. Additionally, the predicate does not correctly propagate the carry (`C1`, `C2`, etc.) through the addition steps. The block also lacks proper constraints for the cryptoaddition puzzle, leading to runtime failures. Recommendations include fixing the `sumdigit` predicate to use ground terms, completing the `query_sum` predicate with missing constraints, and debugging carry propagation.",
