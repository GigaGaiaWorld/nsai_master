  "Report": "The code block has several critical issues: (1) The `is/2` predicate is misused with uninstantiated variables, causing a `CallModeError`. (2) The carry-over logic in `sumdigit` is incomplete and incorrectly implemented. (3) Missing constraints for variables `O`, `M`, and `S` lead to incomplete puzzle solving. (4) The block fails to properly integrate with the rest of the predicate logic. Recommendations: Regenerate with proper variable instantiation before arithmetic operations, complete the carry-over logic, and add missing constraints.",
