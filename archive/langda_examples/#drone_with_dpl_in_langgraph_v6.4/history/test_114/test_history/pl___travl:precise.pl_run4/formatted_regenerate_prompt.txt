System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with recursive dependencies, which causes a negative cycle error. The rules for `inf(X)` depend on `inf(Y)` (e.g., `inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), ...`), creating a circular dependency that violates ProbLog's acyclic requirement. The `initialInf(X)` rule is correct but does not resolve the cyclic dependency in the other rules. The requirements specify probabilities for infection under different conditions, but the recursive implementation is flawed. Recommendations include redesigning the `inf/1` predicate to avoid recursion, using separate predicates for tracking infection status, or adopting a staged approach.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
