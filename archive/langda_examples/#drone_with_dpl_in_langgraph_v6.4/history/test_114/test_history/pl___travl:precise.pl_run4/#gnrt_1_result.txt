Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X), \\+initialInf(X), \\+riskyTravel(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X), \\+initialInf(X), \\+riskyTravel(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X), \\+initialInf(X), \\+ (contact(X,Y), inf(Y)).\n\n% Initial infection\ninf(X) :- initialInf(X)."}
```

Note that:
1. I've used the same HASH value (E09B4F54) from the original code block
2. The code includes the revised infection rules from the generated_code
3. I've preserved all the Prolog syntax including the backslashes for negation
4. The code is formatted as a single string with newline characters separating the rules
