  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with recursive dependencies, which causes a negative cycle error. The rules for `inf(X)` depend on `inf(Y)` (e.g., `inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), ...`), creating a circular dependency that violates ProbLog's acyclic requirement. The `initialInf(X)` rule is correct but does not resolve the cyclic dependency in the other rules. The requirements specify probabilities for infection under different conditions, but the recursive implementation is flawed. Recommendations include redesigning the `inf/1` predicate to avoid recursion, using separate predicates for tracking infection status, or adopting a staged approach.",
