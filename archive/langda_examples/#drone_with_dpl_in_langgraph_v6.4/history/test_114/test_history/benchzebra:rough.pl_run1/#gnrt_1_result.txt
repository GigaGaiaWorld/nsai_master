Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code was:
```prolog
my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)
```

In the generated_code, this appears as:
```prolog
my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),
```

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```json
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```
