  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and appears to be a placeholder for additional constraints needed to solve the zebra puzzle. The current implementation is causing a timeout error, likely due to insufficient constraints leading to an unbounded search space. The block needs to be completed with proper rules to constrain the solution space effectively. This is critical for the solver to terminate with a valid solution.",
