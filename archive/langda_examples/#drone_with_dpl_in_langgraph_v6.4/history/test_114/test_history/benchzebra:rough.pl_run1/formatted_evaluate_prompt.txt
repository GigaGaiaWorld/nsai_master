System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

    raise TimeoutError(f"Function timed out while processing file: {file_basename}")
TimeoutError: Function timed out while processing file: benchzebra:rough.pl_run1</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code is intended to solve the classic "zebra puzzle," which involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given constraints. The code appears to be logically structured but is incomplete, as indicated by the placeholder `<Langda>` and the requirement to "complete the rules." The test results show a timeout error, suggesting that the code may not terminate or is stuck in an infinite loop due to incomplete or incorrect constraints.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Incomplete Code**: The code is missing a critical rule or constraint, as indicated by the `<Langda>` placeholder. This incompleteness prevents the solver from reaching a valid solution.
2. **Timeout Error**: The test results indicate a timeout, which implies the solver is unable to find a solution within the allotted time. This could be due to:
   - Missing or incorrect constraints leading to an infinite search space.
   - Logical inconsistencies in the existing constraints.
3. **Syntax Issues**: While the syntax of the provided code is correct, the incompleteness may cause runtime issues.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "0F506A43",
        "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete. The placeholder `<Langda>` indicates that additional rules or constraints are required to complete the puzzle. Without these, the solver cannot deduce the correct arrangement of houses."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Complete the Missing Rules**: Add the missing constraints to the code. For example, ensure all house attributes (color, nationality, drink, etc.) are fully specified and constrained.
2. **Debug Logical Flow**: Verify that the existing constraints do not conflict with each other and that they collectively narrow down the solution space.
3. **Optimize Performance**: If the solver is still timing out, consider:
   - Reordering constraints to prune the search space early.
   - Adding more specific constraints to reduce ambiguity.
4. **Test Incrementally**: Test the code with subsets of constraints to isolate which part may be causing the timeout.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
