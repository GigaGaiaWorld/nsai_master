    "Report": "The code block implements the insertion sort algorithm correctly in ProbLog. Both the base and recursive cases for insert/3 and insertion_sort/2 predicates are properly defined and logically sound. The test result confirms the implementation works as expected, producing the correct sorted output [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] for the input [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]. The code fully meets the requirement of implementing an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm.",
