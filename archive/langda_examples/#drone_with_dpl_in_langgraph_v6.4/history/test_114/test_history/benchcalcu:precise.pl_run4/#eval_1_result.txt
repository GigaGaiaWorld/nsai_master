Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "B6FD3E20","Report": "The code block correctly enforces that D and E are different digits. However, it lacks integration with the rest of the constraints, such as ensuring D and E are part of the final solution. No regeneration is needed as the logic is correct, but it could be improved with better integration.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "AFCFFD3D","Report": "The `sumdigit` predicate for the unit digit (D + E = Y) is correctly implemented but could be more clearly documented to explain the carry (C1). No regeneration is needed as the logic is correct.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["B6FD3E20"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BA7F9BE8","Report": "The assignment of N and its uniqueness check are correct, but the block could be merged with the subsequent `sumdigit` call for better readability. No regeneration is needed as the logic is correct.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["AFCFFD3D"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "3E567069","Report": "The assignment of R and its uniqueness check are correct, but the block could be streamlined to avoid redundancy with the `all_different` checks. No regeneration is needed as the logic is correct.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["BA7F9BE8"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0BCA612F","Report": "The `sumdigit` predicate for the tens digit (N + R + C1 = E) is logically correct but could benefit from clearer documentation. No regeneration is needed as the logic is correct.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["3E567069"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "710BBD98","Report": "The assignment of O and its uniqueness check are correct, but the block could be merged with the subsequent `sumdigit` call for better readability. No regeneration is needed as the logic is correct.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["0BCA612F"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58F57C1C","Report": "The `sumdigit` predicate for the hundreds digit (E + O + C2 = N) is logically correct but could benefit from clearer documentation. No regeneration is needed as the logic is correct.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["710BBD98"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "70805326","Report": "The assignment of S and its uniqueness check are correct, but the block could be streamlined to avoid redundancy with the `all_different` checks. No regeneration is needed as the logic is correct.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["58F57C1C"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "72F32859","Report": "The assignment of M and its uniqueness check are correct, but the block could be streamlined to avoid redundancy with the `all_different` checks. No regeneration is needed as the logic is correct.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["70805326"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "4623869C","Report": "The `sumdigit` predicate for the thousands digit (S + M + C3 = O) is repeated twice, which is redundant and should be fixed. Regeneration is needed to remove the duplicate call.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["72F32859"]}
```

### Summary:
- Only the code block with hash `4623869C` needs regeneration due to redundancy.
- All other blocks are logically correct but could benefit from minor improvements in documentation or integration.
- Dependencies are noted where one block relies on the output of another.
