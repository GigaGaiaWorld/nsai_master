  "Report": "The code block `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` is redundant and called twice in the original code. Additionally, the constraint `S + M + C3 = O` with the carry result limited to `M` is not clearly enforced. The logic here should be revised to ensure the requirement is met without redundancy. The block should be regenerated to include a single, clear implementation of the constraint and to avoid redundancy.",
