  "Report": "The code block under this hash is intended to enforce the logic for the thousands digit (S + M + C3 = O with carry M). However, the predicate `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` is duplicated, which is redundant. Additionally, the logic does not explicitly ensure that the carry result is limited to M, as required. The `<Langda>` block is also not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed or replaced with comments. The block needs regeneration to address these issues and ensure the correct implementation of the requirements.",
