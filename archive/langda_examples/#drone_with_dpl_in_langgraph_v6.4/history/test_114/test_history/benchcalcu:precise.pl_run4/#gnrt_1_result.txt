Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code had:
- HASH: 4623869C
- Code_Block: sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)
- Requirements: Calculate the thousands digit S + M + C3 = O, and limit the carry result to M

In the generated_code, this appears as:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This is the only code block that was generated to replace the <Langda> section in the original code. The generated code removed the duplicate sumdigit call that was mentioned in the <Report> section of the <Langda> block.
