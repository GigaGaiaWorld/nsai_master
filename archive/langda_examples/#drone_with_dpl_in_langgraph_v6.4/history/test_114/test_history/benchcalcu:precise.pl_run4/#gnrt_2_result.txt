Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The relevant code block in the generated_code is the corrected version of the redundant sumdigit call, which now appears only once with a clear comment explaining its purpose.

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "% Calculate the thousands digit S + M + C3 = O, and limit the carry result to M\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This matches:
1. The HASH tag from the original <Langda> block (4623869C)
2. The requirements specified in the <Requirements> tag
3. The corrected implementation that removes the redundancy mentioned in the <Report>
4. The actual code found in the generated_code
