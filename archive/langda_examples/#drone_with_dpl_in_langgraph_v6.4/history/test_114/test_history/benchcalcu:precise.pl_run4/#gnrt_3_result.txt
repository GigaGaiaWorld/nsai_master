Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The relevant code block from generated_code is:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This is the completed code snippet that replaces the <Langda> block in the origin_code, maintaining the same hash tag "4623869C" from the original report. The code calculates the thousands digit where S + M + C3 = O and limits the carry result to M.
