Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<Langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "% Calculate the thousands digit S + M + C3 = O, and limit the carry result to M\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This matches:
1. The original HASH tag "4623869C" from the `<Langda>` block
2. The requirements for calculating the thousands digit with the carry result limited to M
3. The corrected implementation (removed duplicate line and added comment) from the generated code
