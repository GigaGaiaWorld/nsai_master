  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is a valid constraint for the zebra puzzle, indicating that the house with yellow color has Kools cigarettes. However, it is incomplete as it lacks integration with other constraints and does not fully implement the puzzle's requirements. The timeout error suggests inefficiency or infinite recursion, possibly due to missing or poorly optimized predicates. This block needs regeneration to ensure it is part of a complete and efficient solution.",
