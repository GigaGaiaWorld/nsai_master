It lacks a closing parenthesis and a comma separator, which disrupts the logical flow of the `zebra` predicate. This error prevents the code from being parsed and executed correctly. The block should be completed to 'my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),' to ensure proper integration with the rest of the predicate.",
