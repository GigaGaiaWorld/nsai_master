Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code was:
```prolog
my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)
```

In the generated_code, this appears unchanged but properly integrated into the complete solution. Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses"}
```

Note that while the code block itself is identical between the origin and generated code, in the generated version it's properly integrated as part of a complete working solution rather than being an isolated constraint. The HASH value matches what was provided in the <Langda> block.
