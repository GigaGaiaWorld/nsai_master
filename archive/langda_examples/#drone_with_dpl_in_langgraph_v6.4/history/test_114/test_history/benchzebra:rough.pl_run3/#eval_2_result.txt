  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is incomplete and not properly integrated into the `zebra` predicate. This causes the solver to fail or timeout due to missing constraints. The block should be part of the larger conjunction of constraints in the `zebra` rule. Additionally, the timeout error suggests inefficiency or logical flaws in the overall predicate.",
