Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, here is the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with a <langda> tag in the origin_code, and it appears unchanged in the generated_code (though the report indicated it should have a comma at the end, which it does in the generated code's context).
