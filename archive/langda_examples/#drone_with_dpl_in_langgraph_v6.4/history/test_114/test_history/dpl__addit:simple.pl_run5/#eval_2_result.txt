  "Report": "The addition predicate is correctly implemented to sum the digits associated with the input images and passes the given test case. However, it lacks input validation and error handling for cases where inputs are not valid `digit` facts. The code could be improved for robustness by adding these features, but the current implementation meets the basic requirements and works correctly for valid inputs. The structure is simple but adequate for this small example.",
