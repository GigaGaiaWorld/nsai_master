  "Report": "The code block implements the `addition` predicate correctly in terms of logic, as evidenced by the successful test result (`addition(img_5,img_6,11)`). However, it has the following issues: 1) Missing period (`.`) at the end of the predicate, which is a syntax error in Prolog/ProbLog. 2) The `<Code_Block>` and `<Langda>` tags are not valid syntax and should be removed or replaced with comments. 3) The `<HASH>` and `<Requirements>` tags are not part of the language and should be removed or formatted as comments. The core logic does not need regeneration, but the formatting and syntax do.",
