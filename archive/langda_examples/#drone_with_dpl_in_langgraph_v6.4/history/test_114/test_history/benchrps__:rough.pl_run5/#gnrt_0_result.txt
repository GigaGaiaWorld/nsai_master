Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The placeholder was for defining the game rules of rock-paper-scissors, which appears to be the initial section of the code.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "% Three gestures\nmove(rock).\nmove(paper).\nmove(scissor).\n% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y\nbeats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(scissor, paper).\nbeats(paper, rock)."}
```

Note: The generated_code didn't actually add any new content that wasn't already present in the origin_code (except for the missing play/3 predicate which wasn't defined in either version). The game rules section was already complete in the origin_code, just marked with a <langda> placeholder. I've extracted the relevant portion that corresponds to the placeholder's requirements.
