{"HASH": "CFA63C1E","Report": "This code block correctly defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors, including the gestures (`move/1`) and the win-lose relationships (`beats/2`). It is syntactically and logically correct for the given requirements. No issues were found in the test results related to this block.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The second part of the code defines the `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates. While these predicates are syntactically correct, they are logically incomplete because they depend on the undefined `play/3` predicate. The test failure directly points to this missing dependency. This block needs regeneration to either include the `play/3` predicate or restructure the logic to avoid relying on it.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

Note: The second code block does not have a HASH value in the original input, so it is marked as "N/A". The regeneration should focus on implementing the missing `play/3` predicate or reworking the logic to compute results without it. The first block is correct and does not need regeneration.
