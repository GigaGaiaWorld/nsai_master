</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors and attempts to compute the winner of a game based on a list of moves. However, the test results indicate a critical error due to a missing predicate (`play/3`), which is essential for determining the outcome of each move. The rest of the code is syntactically correct but logically incomplete.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Missing Predicate (`play/3`)**: The error message explicitly states that no clauses are found for `play/3`, which is called in the `determine_winner/3` predicate. This is the root cause of the test failure.
2. **Logical Incompleteness**: The `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates are defined but rely on the missing `play/3` predicate to function correctly.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "CFA63C1E",
        "Report": "This code block correctly defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors, including the gestures (`move/1`) and the win-lose relationships (`beats/2`). It is syntactically and logically correct for the given requirements."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The second part of the code defines the `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates. While these predicates are syntactically correct, they are logically incomplete because they depend on the undefined `play/3` predicate. The `play/3` predicate is necessary to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) of each move pair."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Implement the `play/3` Predicate**: Define the `play/3` predicate to compare each pair of moves from the input lists and return a list of results (win, lose, or draw). For example:
   

2. **Test the Updated Code**: After implementing `play/3`, rerun the test to ensure the `determine_winner/3` predicate works as expected.
3. **Edge Cases**: Consider adding test cases for edge scenarios, such as empty move lists or lists of unequal lengths, to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
