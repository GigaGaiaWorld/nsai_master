  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the `determine_winner` predicate as per the requirements. It calls `play/3` to generate results and `compute_score/2` to calculate the score, then determines the winner based on the score. The logic is sound and the test case passes. However, the block is redundant because the predicate is also partially defined in the first block. This redundancy should be avoided for maintainability.",
