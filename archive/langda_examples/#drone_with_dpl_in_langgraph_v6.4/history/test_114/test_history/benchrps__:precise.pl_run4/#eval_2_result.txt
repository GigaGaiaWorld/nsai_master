{"HASH": "FD850DEC","Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate for handling `draw` cases is correctly implemented. It ensures that a draw does not affect the score, passing the previous score `S1` directly. This aligns with the requirements. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7","Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate is logically correct but has a syntactic issue in the initial definition (redundant comma and incomplete structure). The corrected version properly calls `play/3` to generate results and `compute_score/2` to determine the winner based on the score. Needs minor regeneration to fix syntax.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
