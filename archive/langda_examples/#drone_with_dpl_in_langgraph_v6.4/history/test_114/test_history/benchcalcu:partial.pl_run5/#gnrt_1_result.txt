Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),
sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),

digit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),
sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),

leftdigit(S), leftdigit(M),
all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y])."}
```

Note: Since the `<generated_code>` section was empty in your input, I've extracted the code block from the `<origin_code>`'s `<langda>` section and formatted it as requested. If you have a specific `<generated_code>` section you'd like me to process instead, please provide it.
