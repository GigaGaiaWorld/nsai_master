Here are the structured reports for each code block evaluation:

```report
{"HASH": "0C388A60","Report": "The code block defines the move 'paper' correctly. It implements the requirement fully and has no syntax or logical issues. It integrates perfectly with other code blocks.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057","Report": "The code block defines the move 'scissor' which is syntactically correct but inconsistent with plural naming convention ('scissors' would be better). While it works functionally, regeneration would improve consistency.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["58D60F5E"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "59C3D0D4","Report": "The code block correctly defines the win-lose relationship for 'paper' beating 'rock'. It fully implements the requirement with no issues and integrates well with other rules.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E","Report": "The code block correctly implements the win-lose relationship for 'scissor' beating 'paper', but suffers from the same naming inconsistency as BF964057. Regeneration is recommended to maintain consistency if BF964057 is regenerated.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["BF964057"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "94C4D48B","Report": "The code block perfectly implements the compute_score rule for the 'lose' case. It's syntactically correct, logically sound, and integrates well with the scoring system.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "026B015E","Report": "The code block correctly implements the compute_score rule for the 'draw' case. It meets all requirements and shows no issues in testing or integration.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```
