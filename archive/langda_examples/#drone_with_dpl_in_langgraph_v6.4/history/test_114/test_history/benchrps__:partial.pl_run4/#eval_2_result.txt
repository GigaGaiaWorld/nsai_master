{"HASH": "58D60F5E","Report": "The code block `beats(scissors, paper).` is correct in isolation, but there is a dependency issue with the main code where `beats(rock, scissor).` contains a typo ('scissor' instead of 'scissors'). This causes logical inconsistency in the game rules. The block itself doesn't need regeneration, but the dependent code does.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
