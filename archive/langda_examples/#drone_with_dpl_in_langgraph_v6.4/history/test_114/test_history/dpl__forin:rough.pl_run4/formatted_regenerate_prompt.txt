System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Code_Block>% Insertion Sort in ProbLog

% Base case: an empty list is already sorted
insertion_sort([], []).

% Recursive case: insert the head into the sorted tail
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert(H, SortedTail, Sorted).

% Insert an element into a sorted list
insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
    X @=< H.
insert(X, [H|T], [H|SortedT]) :-
    X @> H,
    insert(X, T, SortedT).</Code_Block>
<Report>The ProbLog code for insertion sort contains logical errors in the `insert/3` predicate, which incorrectly places elements in the sorted list. The condition `X @=< H` disrupts the sorting order by placing `X` at the front prematurely. The `insertion_sort/2` predicate also fails to ensure the tail is fully sorted before inserting the head. These issues result in incorrect sorting, as evidenced by the test output. Recommendations include fixing the `insert/3` predicate to correctly position elements and verifying the sorting logic in `insertion_sort/2`.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
