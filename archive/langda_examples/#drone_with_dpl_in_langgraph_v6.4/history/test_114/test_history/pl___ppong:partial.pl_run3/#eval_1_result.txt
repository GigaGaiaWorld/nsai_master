{"HASH": "766936E0","Report": "The code implements the requirement for multiplayer teams by taking the minimum strength of all members. However, this may not be the most accurate representation of team strength, especially if the `lazy` condition is applied unevenly across team members. The `min` function could lead to underestimating the team's overall capability. Consider using an average or weighted sum for better accuracy.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "2A6AD51D","Report": "The code correctly implements the winning condition based on team strength comparison. However, the issue lies in how the team strengths are calculated (from block 766936E0), which affects the accuracy of the winning probabilities. This block does not need regeneration itself, but its results depend on the corrected team strength calculation.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["766936E0"]}
