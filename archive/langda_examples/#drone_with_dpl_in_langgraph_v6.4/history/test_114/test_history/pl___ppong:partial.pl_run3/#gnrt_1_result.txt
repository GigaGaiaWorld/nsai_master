Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The only code block that was completed in the generated_code is the team_strength predicate for multiplayer teams, which was marked with <langda> in the origin_code.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "766936E0", "Code": "team_strength([P,P2|L],G,S) :- strength(P,G,S1), team_strength([P2|L],G,S2), min(S1,S2,S)."}
```
