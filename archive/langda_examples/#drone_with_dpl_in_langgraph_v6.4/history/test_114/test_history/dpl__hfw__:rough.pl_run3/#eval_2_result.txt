  "Report": "The code block has several critical issues:\n1. The `parse_add_sub_tail` predicate contains logical flaws including unbound variable usage (`R1` referenced before binding) and an invalid base case (`Result.` is not valid Prolog syntax).\n2. Arithmetic operations don't properly propagate intermediate results through recursive calls.\n3. Division handling is incomplete (only checks for zero in one case).\n4. The structure doesn't correctly implement operator precedence (PEMDAS rules).\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Restructure the parsing to properly handle operator precedence\n2. Fix variable binding in arithmetic operations\n3. Implement proper base cases for all recursive predicates\n4. Add comprehensive division by zero checks\n5. Consider using accumulator variables for intermediate results",
