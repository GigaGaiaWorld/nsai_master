  "Report": "The parsing logic in this block is flawed. The `parse_add_sub` and `parse_mul_div` predicates do not correctly implement operator precedence or handle nested expressions. For example, the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7` should be evaluated as `(2 / 3) + 3 - (2 * 7)`, but the current implementation may not respect this order. Additionally, the `parse_add_sub_tail` predicate does not correctly accumulate intermediate results. The test result shows a failure, returning 0.0000 instead of the expected result. The block needs to be regenerated to correctly handle operator precedence and nested expressions.",
