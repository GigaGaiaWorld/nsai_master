  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate has significant logical issues regarding operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation of arithmetic expressions. It currently processes operations strictly left-to-right without considering standard precedence rules (e.g., multiplication/division should be evaluated before addition/subtraction). Additionally, it lacks error handling for division by zero cases. The test result shows incorrect evaluation for the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, which should yield a different result under proper precedence rules.",
