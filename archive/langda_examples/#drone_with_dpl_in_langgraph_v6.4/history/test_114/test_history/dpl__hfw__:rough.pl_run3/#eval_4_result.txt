  "Report": "The code block with hash 190031BC implements the `parse/2` predicate for evaluating arithmetic expressions. The main issues identified are: 1) The `parse_add_sub_tail` predicate incorrectly processes remaining symbols after an operation, leading to incomplete evaluation. 2) The `parse_mul_div` predicate doesn't properly handle floating-point division results. 3) The test result shows incorrect output (0.0000) for the given query, indicating logical flaws. The code needs to be regenerated to fix these issues, particularly the symbol processing in `parse_add_sub_tail` and the division handling in `parse_mul_div`.",
