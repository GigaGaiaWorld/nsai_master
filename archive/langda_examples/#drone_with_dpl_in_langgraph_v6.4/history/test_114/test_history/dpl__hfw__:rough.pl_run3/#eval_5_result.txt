  "Report": "The code block implements a recursive expression evaluator but fails to correctly parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions due to logical flaws. Key issues include: 1) Incorrect handling of operator precedence (PEMDAS/BODMAS rules not enforced), 2) `parse_add_sub_tail` does not properly accumulate intermediate results for addition/subtraction, 3) `parse_mul_div` has an incorrect base case and doesn't propagate values correctly, 4) Division handling is incomplete (only checks for division by zero but doesn't ensure correct evaluation order). The test case fails with result 0.0000, confirming the implementation doesn't meet requirements.",
