  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks critical constraints for the digits `S`, `M`, and `O`. The `sumdigit` calls do not fully enforce the carry-over logic for all digits, leading to incorrect or missing constraints. The `all_different` constraint is correctly implemented but not fully utilized due to missing digit assignments. The test result of 0.0000 indicates that the code fails to find a valid solution, confirming the need for regeneration.",
