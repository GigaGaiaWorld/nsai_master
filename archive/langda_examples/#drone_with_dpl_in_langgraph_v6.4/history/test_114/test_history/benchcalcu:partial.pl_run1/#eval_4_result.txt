  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks proper constraints for the cryptoaddition puzzle. The `sumdigit` predicate does not account for multi-digit sums, and the `all_different` constraints are not consistently applied. Additionally, the carry-over logic (`C1`, `C2`, etc.) is not correctly propagated through the addition steps. The test result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating the code fails to find a valid solution. The block needs regeneration to correctly implement the cryptoaddition logic, including proper handling of carry-over and digit uniqueness constraints.",
