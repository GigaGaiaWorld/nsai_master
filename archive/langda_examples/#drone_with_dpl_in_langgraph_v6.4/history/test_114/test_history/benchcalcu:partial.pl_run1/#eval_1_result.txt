  "Report": "The code block is part of the `query_sum` predicate and attempts to enforce digit uniqueness and sum constraints. However, it is incomplete and lacks critical constraints such as proper digit assignments and carry-over logic. The `sumdigit` calls are not fully integrated, leading to logical gaps. The test result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating no valid solution is found. This block needs regeneration to include all necessary constraints and correct logic.",
