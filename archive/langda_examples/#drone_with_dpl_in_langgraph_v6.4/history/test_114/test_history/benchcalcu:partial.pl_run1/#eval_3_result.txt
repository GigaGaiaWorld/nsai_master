  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks proper constraints for variables like `S`, `M`, and `O`. The `sumdigit` predicates are not correctly modeling the carry-over logic required for the cryptoaddition problem. Additionally, the `all_different` constraints are not enforced for the full list of variables. The test result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating the code fails to find a valid solution. The block needs regeneration to include proper constraints, correct sumdigit logic, and enforce uniqueness for all variables.",
