  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks proper constraints for the variables `S`, `E`, `N`, `D`, `M`, `O`, `R`, and `Y`. The `sumdigit` calls are not correctly chained to propagate carry values, and the `all_different` constraints are not enforced for all variables simultaneously. This leads to the failure in finding a valid solution for the cryptarithmetic puzzle.",
