  "Report": "The `abandon` predicate is correctly implemented as `abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c).`, which matches the requirements. The test results confirm its logical correctness, producing the expected probabilities for each combination of genders. However, the predicate could benefit from additional comments to clarify its purpose and logic. No syntax or logical errors were found, and the implementation aligns with the requirements. The test results further validate its correctness.",
