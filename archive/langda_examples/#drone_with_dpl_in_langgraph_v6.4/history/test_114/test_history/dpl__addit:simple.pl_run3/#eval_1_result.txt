  "Report": "The `addition` rule is syntactically correct and implements the required logic for addition of digits represented by images. However, it lacks a terminating period (`.`) which is required in ProbLog. Additionally, the `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags are not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed. The logic itself is correct and matches the requirements, as evidenced by the successful test result (addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000).",
