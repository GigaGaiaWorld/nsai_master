    "Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate inside the `<Langda>` block is correctly implemented and matches the requirements. It calls `play/3` to generate the results list and `compute_score/2` to calculate the cumulative score. The logic for determining the winner based on the score is also correct. The test result confirms that the code works as expected. However, the redundant definition of `determine_winner` outside the block should be removed to avoid confusion and potential maintenance issues. No regeneration is needed for this block, but the redundant code should be cleaned up.",
