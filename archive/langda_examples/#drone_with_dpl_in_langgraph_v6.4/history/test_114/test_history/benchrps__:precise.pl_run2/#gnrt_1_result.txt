Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- \n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, S),\n    ( S > 0, Winner = player1\n    ; S < 0, Winner = player2\n    ; S = 0, Winner = draw\n    )."}
```

Note that this is the only code block that was marked with <langda> in the origin_code. The generated code shows this same implementation (without redundancy) as the final version of the `determine_winner` predicate.
