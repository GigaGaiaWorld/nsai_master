The split/3 and merge/3 predicates function as intended, as confirmed by the test results. However, the code could benefit from additional comments for clarity and explicit documentation of assumptions (e.g., merge/3 requiring sorted lists). No critical errors were found, and the test results confirm the implementation meets the requirements. The code does not need regeneration but could be improved with minor enhancements for readability and robustness.",

The query/1 predicate serves as a test case and confirms the correctness of the merge_sort/2 implementation. These predicates do not need regeneration but should be separated from the core logic or removed if not needed elsewhere.",
