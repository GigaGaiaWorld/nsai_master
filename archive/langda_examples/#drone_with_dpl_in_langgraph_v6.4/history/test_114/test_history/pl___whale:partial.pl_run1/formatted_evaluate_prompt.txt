<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements for modeling the scenario of whales in different positions and genders across six possible worlds. The test results align with the expected probabilities for the queries, indicating logical correctness. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and potential improvements for clarity and completeness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Missing Constraints for Query 2**: The `constraint1` predicate is defined but not used as evidence in the query, which limits its functionality.
2. **Redundant Code Blocks**: Some code blocks (e.g., `position(1,b) :- world(c).`) are repeated across worlds, which could be streamlined.
3. **Incomplete Documentation**: The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of each world and the reasoning behind the probabilities.
</Error_Summary>

        "Report": "The code block correctly defines a uniform distribution over the six worlds. No issues found."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Activate Constraint for Query 2**: Uncomment the `evidence(constraint1).` line to ensure the constraint is applied during inference.
2. **Streamline Repetitive Code**: Consider using a more concise representation for repeated predicates (e.g., using loops or meta-programming if supported).
3. **Enhance Documentation**: Add comments to explain the purpose of each world and the reasoning behind the probabilities.
4. **Validate Edge Cases**: Test the model with additional edge cases to ensure robustness, such as worlds with missing or conflicting information.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
