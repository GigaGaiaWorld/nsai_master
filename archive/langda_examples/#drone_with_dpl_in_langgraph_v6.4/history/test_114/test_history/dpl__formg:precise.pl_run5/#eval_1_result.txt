Here are the structured reports for each code block:

```report
{
  "HASH": "95E704F2",
  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: it checks the length of the list, ensures the list is split only if its length is greater than 1, and splits the list into two parts (`Left` and `Right`). However, the `split_list` predicate could be optimized to ensure the split is as balanced as possible, especially for lists with odd lengths. No immediate regeneration is needed as the current implementation works correctly for the given test case, but optimization is recommended for better performance and handling of edge cases.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "26E82D5D",
  "Report": "This code block correctly implements the recursive merge sort logic: it sorts the left and right halves of the list and merges them. The `merge` predicate is also correctly implemented to handle the merging of two sorted lists. No issues are identified in this block for the given test case. No regeneration is needed.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

### Summary:
- Neither code block requires immediate regeneration as they both meet the requirements and pass the given test case.
- The first block (`95E704F2`) could benefit from optimization for better handling of lists with odd lengths, but this is not critical.
- The second block (`26E82D5D`) is fully functional and correctly implements the merge sort logic.
