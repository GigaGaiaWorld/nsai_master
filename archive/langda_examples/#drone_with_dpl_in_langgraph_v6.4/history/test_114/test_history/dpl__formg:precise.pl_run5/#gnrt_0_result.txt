Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code corresponding to the <langda> blocks in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "length(List, Len), Len > 1, split_list(List, Left, Right)"}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "26E82D5D", "Code": "merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft), merge_sort(Right, SortedRight), merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)"}
```

These code snippets fulfill the requirements specified in each <Langda> block:
1. The first snippet handles list length checking and splitting
2. The second snippet handles the recursive sorting and merging of sublists
