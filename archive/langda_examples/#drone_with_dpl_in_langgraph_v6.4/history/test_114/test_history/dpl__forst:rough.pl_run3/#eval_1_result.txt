  "Report": "The second code block introduces the `sort` operation, which is incomplete due to the missing `insertion_sort` predicate. Additionally, the `get_top_n` predicate does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than `N` elements, which could lead to runtime errors. The lack of test queries for this operation further obscures its correctness. This block needs regeneration to address these issues.",
