System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>number([], 0).
number([H|T], N) :-
    digit(H, D),
    number(T, N1),
    N is N1 * 10 + D.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 06576BEB </HASH>
<Requirements>define number predicate, to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. </Requirements></Langda>
.
multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,X2),number(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],310) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements for converting a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values and performing addition. The test result shows the correct output for the given query, indicating that the logic is functioning as intended. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and potential improvements for clarity and robustness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. The `digit` facts are not enclosed in a proper ProbLog program block, which could lead to confusion in larger programs.
2. The `number` predicate lacks a base case for an empty list, which is implicitly handled by the current implementation but could be made explicit for clarity.
3. The `multi_addition` predicate works correctly but could be generalized for more use cases.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "06576BEB",
        "Report": "The `digit` facts are correctly defined but are not enclosed in a ProbLog program block. This could cause issues in larger programs where multiple blocks are involved. The `number` predicate is logically correct but lacks an explicit base case for an empty list, which is currently handled by the recursive case."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for the `multi_addition` predicate)",
        "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate correctly implements the addition of two numbers derived from lists of image IDs. However, it could be generalized to handle more than two operands or include error handling for invalid inputs."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Enclose the `digit` facts in a proper ProbLog program block for better organization.
2. Add an explicit base case for the `number` predicate to handle empty lists, even though the current implementation works.
3. Generalize the `multi_addition` predicate to handle more operands or include input validation.
4. Consider adding comments to explain the logic for better maintainability.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
