The generated code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem but contains a critical error in the 'open_door' predicate. The original code correctly implements the host's behavior of opening a door that is neither the selected door nor has the prize, with a 50% probability when two options are available. The generated code fails to properly implement this logic, resulting in incorrect probabilities for 'win_switch' (0.0000 instead of the expected 0.6667). The form of the generated code is valid Problog syntax, but the logic is flawed.
