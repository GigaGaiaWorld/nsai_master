% Merge Sort implementation in ProbLog

% Base case for an empty list
merge_sort([], []).

% Base case for a single-element list
merge_sort([X], [X]).

% Recursive case: split the list, sort the halves, and merge them
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

% Split the list into two halves
split([], [], []).
split([X], [X], []).
split([X, Y | Tail], [X | Left], [Y | Right]) :-
    split(Tail, Left, Right).

% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X | LeftTail], [Y | RightTail], [X | Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(LeftTail, [Y | RightTail], Merged).
merge([X | LeftTail], [Y | RightTail], [Y | Merged]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X | LeftTail], RightTail, Merged).
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. Both codes handle base cases and recursive sorting by splitting, sorting, and merging lists. The generated code uses a different splitting method (pairwise splitting) compared to the original (length-based splitting), but both achieve the same result. The merge and append functions are identical in both codes. The running results are consistent, producing the correct sorted list.
