</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test result shows that it correctly sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000. This indicates that the core logic of the merge sort is functioning as expected. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and potential improvements that could enhance readability and robustness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Issue**: The code is syntactically valid, but the formatting (e.g., line breaks and indentation) could be improved for better readability.
2. **Logical Issue**: The `split_list` predicate does not correctly split the list into two halves. The current implementation uses `length(Left, Half)` and `append(Left, Right, List)`, which does not guarantee that `Left` and `Right` are the first and second halves of the original list, respectively.
3. **Integration Issue**: The recursive calls and merging logic are correctly implemented, but the `split_list` predicate's flaw affects the overall correctness of the algorithm.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "95E704F2",
        "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: 
        1. It calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine whether to continue splitting.
        2. It includes a boundary check (`Len > 1`) to ensure only lists longer than 1 are processed further.
        3. It calls `split_list` to divide the list into `Left` and `Right` parts. However, the `split_list` predicate itself is flawed, as it does not correctly split the list into two equal halves."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "26E82D5D",
        "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements:
        1. It recursively calls `merge_sort` on the left and right halves (`Left` and `Right`), producing `SortedLeft` and `SortedRight`.
        2. It merges the two sorted sublists (`SortedLeft` and `SortedRight`) into the final sorted result (`Sorted`). The merging logic is correctly implemented and handles edge cases (empty lists) appropriately."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix `split_list` Predicate**: Replace the current implementation with a correct splitting mechanism. For example:
   

   This ensures that `Left` contains the first `Half` elements, and `Right` contains the remaining elements.

2. **Improve Code Formatting**: Add proper indentation and line breaks to enhance readability.

3. **Add Comments**: Include comments to explain the purpose of each predicate and the overall logic of the merge sort algorithm.

4. **Test Edge Cases**: Test the code with additional edge cases, such as an empty list, a single-element list, and a list with an odd number of elements, to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
