{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: 1. It calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine whether to continue splitting. 2. It includes a boundary check (`Len > 1`) to ensure only lists longer than 1 are processed further. 3. It calls `split_list` to divide the list into `Left` and `Right` parts. However, the `split_list` predicate itself is flawed, as it does not correctly split the list into two equal halves. The block itself does not need regeneration, but the `split_list` predicate it depends on does.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: 1. It recursively calls `merge_sort` on the left and right halves (`Left` and `Right`), producing `SortedLeft` and `SortedRight`. 2.
