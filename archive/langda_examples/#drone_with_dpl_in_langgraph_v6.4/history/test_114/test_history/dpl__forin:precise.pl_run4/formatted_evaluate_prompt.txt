System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DA97FB01 </HASH>
<Requirements>1.recursively sort the tail list, 2.insert the head element H into the sorted list </Requirements></Langda>
.
insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
 X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
 X > H,
 insert_element(X, T, RT).
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.
<original_code>

insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DA97FB01 </HASH>
<Requirements>1.recursively sort the tail list, 2.insert the head element H into the sorted list </Requirements></Langda>
.
insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
 X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
 X > H,
 insert_element(X, T, RT).
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements an insertion sort algorithm, and the test result indicates that it correctly sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000. The code appears to be syntactically valid and logically correct based on the test case. However, a deeper analysis is required to ensure robustness and correctness for all possible inputs.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No errors were identified in the provided code or test results. The code meets the specified requirements of recursively sorting the tail list and inserting the head element into the sorted list. The test case confirms the correctness of the implementation.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "DA97FB01",
        "Report": "The code block correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm. It recursively sorts the tail of the list (`SortedTail`) and then inserts the head element (`H`) into the sorted tail using the `insert_element` predicate. The logic adheres to the requirements and works as expected."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for `insert_element` predicate)",
        "Report": "The `insert_element` predicate is correctly implemented. It handles three cases: inserting an element into an empty list, inserting an element at the correct position in a non-empty list, and recursively inserting an element into the tail of the list if it does not belong at the head. The logic is sound and matches the requirements."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Additional Test Cases**: While the provided test case is correct, it is recommended to test the code with additional inputs, including edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements, to ensure full coverage.
2. **Documentation**: Adding comments to explain the logic of the `insert_element` predicate and the recursive sorting process would improve code readability and maintainability.
3. **Performance Considerations**: For larger lists, the insertion sort algorithm may not be efficient. If performance is a concern, consider implementing a more efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort.
4. **Error Handling**: While not strictly necessary for this example, adding checks for non-integer inputs or other edge cases could make the code more robust.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
