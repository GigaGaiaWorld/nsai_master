  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm. It recursively sorts the tail of the list (`SortedTail`) and then inserts the head element (`H`) into the sorted tail using the `insert_element` predicate. The logic adheres to the requirements and works as expected. The test case confirms the correctness of the implementation. No issues were identified.",
