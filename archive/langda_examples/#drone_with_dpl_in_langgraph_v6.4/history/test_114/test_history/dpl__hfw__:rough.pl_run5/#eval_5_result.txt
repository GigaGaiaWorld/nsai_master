  "Report": "The code block contains the `parse/2` predicate, which is intended to recursively evaluate arithmetic expressions. The implementation uses the cut operator (`!/0`) to enforce deterministic behavior, which is not supported in ProbLog. This causes the test to fail. Additionally, the `find_op/4` predicate's logic for operator precedence (handling `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) may not fully align with ProbLog's capabilities or the intended requirements. The code needs to be regenerated to remove the cut operator and ensure logical correctness in ProbLog.",
