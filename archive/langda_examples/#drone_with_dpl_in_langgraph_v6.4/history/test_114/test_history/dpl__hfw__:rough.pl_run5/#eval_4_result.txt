  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is intended to handle arithmetic expressions with operator precedence, but it fails to correctly evaluate nested operations. The `find_op/4` predicate does not properly split expressions for nested operations, leading to incorrect results. For example, in the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, the parser should prioritize multiplication and division but fails to do so. The test result of 0.0000 confirms this logical error. Recommendations include rewriting `find_op/4` to correctly handle operator precedence, adding debugging outputs, and testing with simpler expressions first.",
