  "Report": "The code block implements a recursive expression evaluator for arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) using parse/2 and split_high_precedence predicates. However, it has critical issues: 1) It uses Prolog's append/3 which is not supported in ProbLog (as confirmed by the test error), 2) The split_high_precedence logic assumes Prolog's backtracking behavior which may not work in ProbLog. The code fails to meet requirements due to these incompatibilities.",
