Here are the extracted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` placeholder in the `<origin_code>`, formatted in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "190031BC", "Code": "parse([N], N).\nparse([N, O | T], Result) :-\n    parse(T, R),\n    (O = '+' -> Result is N + R;\n     O = '-' -> Result is N - R;\n     O = '*' -> Result is N * R;\n     O = '/' -> Result is N / R)."}
```

This is the only code block that corresponds to the `<langda>` placeholder in the original code, which requested a recursive expression evaluator for arithmetic operations. The hash tag "190031BC" was provided in the original placeholder information.
