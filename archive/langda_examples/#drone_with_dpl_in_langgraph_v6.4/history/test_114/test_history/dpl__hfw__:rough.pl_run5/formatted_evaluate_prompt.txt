</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code aims to implement a recursive expression evaluator in ProbLog, capable of parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, the test results indicate a critical error related to the use of the cut operator (`!/0`), which is not supported in ProbLog. Additionally, the logical correctness of the `parse/2` predicate needs verification to ensure it adheres to the specified requirements.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Unsupported Cut Operator (`!/0`)**: The error message explicitly states that no clauses are found for `!/0`, as ProbLog does not support this Prolog control predicate. This is the primary cause of the test failure.
2. **Logical Correctness**: While the `parse/2` predicate appears to implement the required operations, its integration with the rest of the code and its adherence to ProbLog's syntax and semantics need further validation.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "190031BC",
        "Report": "The code block contains the `parse/2` predicate, which is intended to recursively evaluate arithmetic expressions. The implementation uses the cut operator (`!/0`) to enforce deterministic behavior, which is not supported in ProbLog. This causes the test to fail. Additionally, the `find_op/4` predicate's logic for operator precedence (handling `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) may not fully align with ProbLog's capabilities or the intended requirements."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Remove the Cut Operator**: Replace the cut operator (`!/0`) with alternative constructs supported by ProbLog, such as explicit condition checks or restructuring the logic to avoid non-determinism.
2. **Validate Logical Correctness**: Ensure the `parse/2` predicate correctly handles operator precedence and associativity without relying on unsupported features.
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test the `parse/2` predicate with simpler expressions first to isolate and fix any logical issues before scaling to more complex cases.
4. **Consult ProbLog Documentation**: Refer to ProbLog's documentation for supported control predicates and best practices for implementing recursive evaluators.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
