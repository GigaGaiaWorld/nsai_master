  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate has significant logical errors in handling operator precedence, particularly in the `find_op/4` clauses. The third clause of `find_op/4` fails to correctly handle nested expressions with mixed operators, leading to incorrect evaluation. The `apply_op/4` predicate is correct but not being utilized properly due to parsing failures. The test result confirms this issue, as it returns `0.0000` for a non-trivial expression. The code block needs regeneration to correctly implement operator precedence and ensure proper integration with `detect_all/2`.",
