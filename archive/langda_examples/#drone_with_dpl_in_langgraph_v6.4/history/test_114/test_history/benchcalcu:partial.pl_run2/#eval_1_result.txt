  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains syntax errors. The `query_sum` predicate is missing critical parts of the logic, such as the final constraints for the sum. Additionally, the `sumdigit` clauses are not properly integrated into the main predicate, leading to ambiguity in the parsing process. The error message indicates an 'Ambiguous token role,' which suggests a parsing failure due to incomplete or misplaced code. The block needs to be regenerated to include all necessary constraints and properly integrate the `sumdigit` clauses.",
