Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n    sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n    \n    digit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n    sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n    \n    digit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n    sumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, _)"}
```

This JSON object contains:
- The original hash "1039E900" from the `<Langda>` block
- The completed code that replaces the placeholder in the original code
- The code maintains all the constraints and properly integrates the `sumdigit` clauses as required in the original requirements
