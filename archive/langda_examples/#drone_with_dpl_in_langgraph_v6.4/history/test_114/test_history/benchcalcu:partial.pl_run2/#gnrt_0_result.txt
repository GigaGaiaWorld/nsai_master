Based on the origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code. Here's the completed code snippet that fills the placeholder:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900","Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n    sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n    \n    digit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n    sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n    \n    digit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n    sumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, _)"}
```

This code completes the predicate logic by:
1. Adding the digit O and ensuring it's different from previous digits
2. Performing the sumdigit operation with E, O, N and carry C3
3. Adding digit M and ensuring uniqueness
4. Performing sumdigit with S, M, O and carry C4
5. Adding digit S (ensuring it's a left digit and unique)
6. Performing the final sumdigit check for M
