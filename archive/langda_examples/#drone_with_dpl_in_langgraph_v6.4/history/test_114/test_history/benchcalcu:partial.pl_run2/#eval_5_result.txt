  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and contains a syntax error in the `sumdigit` predicate. The `is/2` predicate is used incorrectly, as it requires the second argument to be ground. Additionally, the `query_sum` predicate lacks some digit assignments and constraints, such as ensuring all digits are unique and correctly assigned. The `sumdigit` predicate also incorrectly handles carry-over logic. Recommendations include fixing the `sumdigit` predicate, completing the `query_sum` predicate, and testing incrementally.",
