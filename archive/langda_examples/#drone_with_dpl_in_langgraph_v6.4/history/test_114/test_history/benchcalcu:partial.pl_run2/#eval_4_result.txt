  "HASH": "1039E900",
  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains critical errors. The primary issue is a call mode error in the `sumdigit` predicate due to non-ground arguments being passed to the `is/2` operator, which violates ProbLog's requirements. Additionally, the `query_sum` predicate is incomplete, as indicated by the `<Langda>` placeholder. The code also lacks proper formatting and has inconsistent spacing, which could lead to parsing errors. To fix these issues, the `sumdigit` predicate should be modified to ensure all variables are instantiated before arithmetic operations, and the `<Langda>` placeholder should be replaced with the correct ProbLog code to complete the predicate logic. The code should also be formatted consistently to avoid parsing issues.",
