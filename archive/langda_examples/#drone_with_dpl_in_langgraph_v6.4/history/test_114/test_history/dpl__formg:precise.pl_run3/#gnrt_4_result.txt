Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` blocks in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-\n    length(List, Len),\n    (Len > 1 ->\n        Half is Len // 2,\n        split_list(List, Half, Left, Right),\n        merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),\n        merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),\n        merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)\n    ;\n        Sorted = List\n    )."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "split_list(List, Half, Left, Right) :-\n    length(Left, Half),\n    append(Left, Right, List)."}
```

Note: Both code blocks share the same HASH value since they were both part of the same `<langda>` section in the original code. The first block is the main `merge_sort` predicate implementation, and the second block is the corrected `split_list` predicate that properly splits the list into two halves.
