  "Report": "The code block for merge_sort has several issues: 1. It's incorrectly split into two parts in the original code, disrupting the logical flow. 2. While it implements the required length check and splitting logic, it doesn't properly integrate with the merge predicate. 3. The recursive boundary condition is technically correct but the overall structure makes it vulnerable to errors. 4. The test failure indicates this implementation doesn't work correctly in the ProbLog environment. The code needs regeneration to: a) Combine all merge_sort clauses into a coherent whole b) Better integrate with the merge predicate c) Follow ProbLog syntax requirements",
