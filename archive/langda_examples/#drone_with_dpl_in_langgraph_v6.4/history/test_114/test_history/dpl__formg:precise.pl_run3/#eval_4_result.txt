  "Report": "The `merge_sort` predicate partially meets the requirements but has several issues. 1. The recursive boundary judgment is correctly implemented for lists of length 0 or 1, but the overall structure is problematic due to syntax errors. 2. The `split_list` predicate is logically incorrect as it uses `append` in reverse to split the list, which doesn't properly divide the list into two halves. 3. The code fails to execute due to parsing errors, indicating syntax issues. 4. The merge logic appears correct but isn't being properly utilized due to the other issues.",
