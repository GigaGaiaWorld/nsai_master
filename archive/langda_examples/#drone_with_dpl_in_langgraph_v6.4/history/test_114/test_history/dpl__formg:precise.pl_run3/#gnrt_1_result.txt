Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "length(List, Len),\n    (Len > 1 ->\n        Half is Len // 2,\n        length(Left, Half),\n        append(Left, Right, List)"}
```

This extracted code block:
1. Matches the HASH from the original <langda> block (95E704F2)
2. Contains the completed implementation that fulfills all requirements:
   - Gets the length of the list (Len)
   - Checks if length > 1 (recursive boundary)
   - Splits the list into Left and Right parts
3. Includes the corrected implementation that properly splits the list (using Half calculation and append)
