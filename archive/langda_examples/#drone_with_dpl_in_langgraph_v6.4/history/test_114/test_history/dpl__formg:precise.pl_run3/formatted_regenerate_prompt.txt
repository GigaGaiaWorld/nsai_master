System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The `merge_sort` predicate partially meets the requirements but has several issues. 1. The recursive boundary judgment is correctly implemented for lists of length 0 or 1, but the overall structure is problematic due to syntax errors. 2. The `split_list` predicate is logically incorrect as it uses `append` in reverse to split the list, which doesn't properly divide the list into two halves. 3. The code fails to execute due to parsing errors, indicating syntax issues. 4. The merge logic appears correct but isn't being properly utilized due to the other issues.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
