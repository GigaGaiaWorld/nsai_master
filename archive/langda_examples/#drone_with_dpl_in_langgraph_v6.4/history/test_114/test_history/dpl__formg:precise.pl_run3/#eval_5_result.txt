  "Report": "The `merge_sort` predicate partially meets the requirements but has significant issues. It correctly implements the recursive boundary check (Len > 1) and splits the list into Left and Right sublists. However, the `split_list` predicate it depends on is incorrectly implemented, which affects its functionality. The predicate also lacks proper integration with the `merge` predicate due to syntax errors in the overall code. The test failure indicates that the code block, while logically partially correct, cannot execute as intended.",

This predicate is critical for the `merge_sort` predicate to function correctly.
