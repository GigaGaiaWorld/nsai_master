  "Report": "The code block under this hash attempts to split the list into two parts (`Left` and `Right`) and checks if the length of the list is greater than 1. However, the conditional logic (`Len > 1 ->`) is not valid ProbLog syntax. Additionally, the `split_list` predicate is redundant and should be integrated directly into the `merge_sort` predicate. The block partially meets the requirements by handling the length check and splitting, but fails due to syntax incompatibility and redundancy.",
