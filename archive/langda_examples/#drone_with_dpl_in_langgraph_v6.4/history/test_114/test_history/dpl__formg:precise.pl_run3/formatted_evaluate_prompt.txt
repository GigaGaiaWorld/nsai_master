System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code aims to implement a merge sort algorithm, but it contains several syntax and logical issues that prevent it from executing correctly. The test results indicate a parsing error, which suggests that the code is not syntactically valid. Additionally, the logical structure of the merge sort implementation does not fully adhere to the specified requirements.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Error**: The code contains ambiguous or incorrect syntax, leading to a parsing error ("Ambiguous token role"). This is likely due to misplaced or incomplete predicates.
2. **Logical Issues**: 
   - The `split_list` predicate is incorrectly defined. It does not split the list into two parts as required.
   - The recursive boundary condition is not properly enforced in the `merge_sort` predicate.
   - The `merge` predicate logic is correct but may not integrate properly due to other issues.
3. **Integration Issues**: The predicates do not work together seamlessly, causing the overall algorithm to fail.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "95E704F2",
        "Report": "The `merge_sort` predicate partially meets the requirements but lacks proper recursive boundary enforcement. The `split_list` predicate is incorrectly implemented, failing to split the list into two parts. The `merge` predicate is logically correct but may not integrate well due to other issues."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `split_list` predicate is flawed. It incorrectly uses `length(Left, Half)` to define the left sublist, which does not split the original list. The `append` predicate is correctly defined but not used effectively in this context."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax Errors**: Ensure all predicates are correctly defined and terminated. Remove any ambiguous or incomplete syntax.
2. **Correct `split_list` Predicate**: Implement a proper splitting mechanism, such as using `append` to divide the list into two sublists of roughly equal length.
3. **Enforce Recursive Boundary**: Ensure the `merge_sort` predicate correctly handles lists of length 0 or 1 as base cases.
4. **Test Integration**: Verify that all predicates work together by testing intermediate steps (e.g., splitting and merging sublists).
5. **Debugging**: Use smaller test cases to isolate and fix issues before scaling up to larger lists.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
