Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> blocks in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-\n    length(List, Len),\n    (Len > 1 ->\n        Half is Len // 2,\n        split_list(List, Left, Right),\n        merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),\n        merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),\n        merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)\n    ;\n        Sorted = List\n    )."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "split_list(List, Left, Right) :-\n    length(List, Len),\n    Half is Len // 2,\n    length(Left, Half),\n    append(Left, Right, List)."}
```

Note that I've used the same HASH value ("95E704F2") for both code blocks since they both originated from the same <langda> section in the original code. The first block contains the main merge_sort implementation, and the second block contains the split_list helper predicate that was referenced in the merge_sort implementation.
