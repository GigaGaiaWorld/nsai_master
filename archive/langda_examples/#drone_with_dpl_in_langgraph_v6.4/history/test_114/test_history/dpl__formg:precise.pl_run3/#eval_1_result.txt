{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements the logic for getting the length of the list and checking if it needs to be split (Len > 1). However, the syntax error (unmatched parenthesis) in the surrounding code affects this block's functionality. The `split_list` predicate called here is also flawed, as it does not correctly split the list into two equal parts. The requirements are partially met, but the block needs regeneration due to the syntax error and dependency on a flawed `split_list` implementation.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Report": "This code block correctly implements the recursive calls to `merge_sort` for the left and right halves of the list and merges the results using the `merge` predicate. The logic here is sound and meets the requirements. However, its correctness depends on the `split_list` predicate, which is currently flawed. Since the `split_list` issue is external to this block, this block does not need regeneration itself.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["95E704F2"]}
