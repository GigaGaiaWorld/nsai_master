{"HASH": "766936E0","Report": "The `team_strength` predicate for multiplayer teams correctly uses the `min` function to determine the team strength, as required. However, the implementation could be optimized or clarified for better readability. For example, the recursive call could be documented to explain its purpose. No critical issues are present, so regeneration is not strictly necessary.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "2A6AD51D","Report": "The `wins` predicate is correctly implemented. It compares the team strengths and declares the winner based on the higher strength. The negation for the second `wins` clause ensures mutual exclusivity. No issues are identified.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
