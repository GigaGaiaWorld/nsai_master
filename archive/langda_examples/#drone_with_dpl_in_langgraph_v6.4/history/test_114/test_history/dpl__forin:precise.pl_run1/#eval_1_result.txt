  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the insertion sort logic by recursively sorting the tail of the list and inserting the head element into the sorted tail. The predicate `insert_element` is used appropriately to place the head element in the correct position within the sorted list. The test results confirm that the implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No syntax or logical errors were identified.",
