System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DA97FB01 </HASH>
<Requirements>1.recursively sort the tail list, 2.insert the head element H into the sorted list </Requirements></Langda>
.
insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
 X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
 X > H,
 insert_element(X, T, RT).
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.
<original_code>

insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DA97FB01 </HASH>
<Requirements>1.recursively sort the tail list, 2.insert the head element H into the sorted list </Requirements></Langda>
.
insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
 X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
 X > H,
 insert_element(X, T, RT).
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements an insertion sort algorithm, and the test results indicate that it correctly sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct, fulfilling the specified requirements of recursively sorting the tail list and inserting the head element into the sorted list. 
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No errors were identified in the code. The implementation adheres to the requirements, and the test results confirm its correctness. 
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "DA97FB01",
        "Report": "The code block recursively sorts the tail of the list and inserts the head element into the sorted tail. This implementation is correct and aligns with the requirements. The predicate `insert_element` is used to place the head element in the correct position within the sorted list."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. While the current implementation is correct, consider adding edge case tests (e.g., empty list, single-element list, or lists with duplicate elements) to ensure robustness.
2. Document the code to clarify the logic for future maintainability, especially the role of the `insert_element` predicate.
3. If performance is a concern, explore optimizations, though ProbLog is primarily designed for probabilistic logic rather than performance-critical sorting.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
