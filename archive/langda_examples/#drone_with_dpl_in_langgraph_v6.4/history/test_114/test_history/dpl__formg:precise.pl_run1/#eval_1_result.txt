Here are the structured reports for each code block:

```report
{
    "HASH": "95E704F2",
    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: it checks the length of the list, ensures the list is split only if its length is greater than 1, and splits the list into `Left` and `Right` parts. However, the `split_list` predicate uses `append` to split the list, which is inefficient. A more efficient approach would be to directly split the list without using `append`. The block does not need regeneration for correctness but could be optimized for performance.",
    "Need_regenerate": false,
    "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "26E82D5D",
    "Report": "This code block correctly implements the recursive sorting and merging logic. It recursively sorts the left and right halves of the list and merges them into the final sorted result. The implementation adheres to the requirements and works as expected. No regeneration is needed.",
    "Need_regenerate": false,
    "Dependencies": []
}
```

### Notes:
1. **95E704F2**: While the code block is functionally correct, the inefficiency in `split_list` could be addressed. However, since the inefficiency does not affect correctness or the test results, regeneration is not strictly necessary. If optimization is desired, it could be regenerated with a more efficient splitting mechanism.
2. **26E82D5D**: This block is fully correct and meets all requirements. No regeneration is needed.
3. **Dependencies**: Neither block has dependencies that require regeneration. The `split_list` inefficiency is isolated and does not affect the other block.
