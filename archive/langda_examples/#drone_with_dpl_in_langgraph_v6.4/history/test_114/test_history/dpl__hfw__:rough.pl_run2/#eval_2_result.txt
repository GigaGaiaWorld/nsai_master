  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate correctly implements recursive evaluation for arithmetic operations but fails to account for operator precedence. For example, in the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, the multiplication (`2 * 7`) should be evaluated before the division and addition. The current implementation evaluates left-to-right, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the predicate does not handle edge cases such as division by zero or invalid operator symbols.",
