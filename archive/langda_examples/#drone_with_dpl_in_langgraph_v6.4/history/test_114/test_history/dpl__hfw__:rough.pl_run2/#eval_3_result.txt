  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate fails to correctly implement operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation of arithmetic expressions. The current implementation processes operators left-to-right without considering the standard precedence rules (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction). This causes the test case `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7]` to return `0.0000` instead of the correct result. Additionally, the predicate lacks proper error handling for division by zero cases. The requirements for a recursive expression evaluator with correct operator precedence are not fully met.",
