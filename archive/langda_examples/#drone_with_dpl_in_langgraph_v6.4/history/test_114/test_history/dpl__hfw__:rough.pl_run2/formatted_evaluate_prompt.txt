</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code aims to implement a recursive expression evaluator in ProbLog, capable of parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions involving numbers and operators. While the foundational logic for detecting numbers and operators is correctly implemented, the parsing logic is incomplete, leading to a runtime error. The test results indicate a missing predicate (`split_lowest_precedence/4`), which is critical for the parsing functionality. The code does not fully meet the specified requirements due to this omission.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Missing Predicate**: The error `No clauses found for 'split_lowest_precedence/4'` indicates that the predicate `split_lowest_precedence/4` is not defined, yet it is called in the `parse/2` predicate. This is the primary cause of the test failure.
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `parse/2` predicate relies on `split_lowest_precedence/4` to split expressions into sub-expressions based on operator precedence, but this functionality is missing.
3. **Logical Gaps**: The code does not handle operator precedence or associativity, which are essential for correctly evaluating arithmetic expressions.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "190031BC",
        "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is intended to recursively evaluate arithmetic expressions by splitting them into sub-expressions based on operator precedence. However, the predicate `split_lowest_precedence/4` is not defined, causing a runtime error. Additionally, the predicate does not account for operator precedence or associativity, which are critical for correct evaluation."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Define `split_lowest_precedence/4`**: Implement this predicate to split expressions into left and right sub-expressions based on the lowest precedence operator. For example:
   

2. **Handle Operator Precedence**: Ensure the parsing logic respects operator precedence (e.g., multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for expressions with varying operator precedence and associativity to validate correctness.
4. **Document Assumptions**: Clearly document any assumptions about operator precedence or expression formatting to avoid ambiguity.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
