  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is intended to recursively evaluate arithmetic expressions but has several critical issues. The base case `parse([N], N).` is syntactically correct but may not align with the expected input format. The recursive case attempts to evaluate expressions but lacks proper handling of operator precedence and associativity, which could lead to incorrect results. Additionally, the predicate is not properly integrated into the ProbLog program, causing a runtime error ('No clauses found for ''->'/2''). The predicate needs to be revised to correctly handle both the base and recursive cases, ensure proper integration with the rest of the program, and potentially address operator precedence if required.",
