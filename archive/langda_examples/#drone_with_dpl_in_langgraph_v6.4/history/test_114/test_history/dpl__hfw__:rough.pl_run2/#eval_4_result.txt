  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is logically structured but incomplete. It requires two supporting predicates (`split_lowest_precedence/4` and `apply_operator/4`) that are missing, causing runtime errors. The current implementation fails to handle operator precedence or basic arithmetic operations. To meet requirements, it needs regeneration with: 1) Operator precedence handling via `split_lowest_precedence/4`, 2) Arithmetic logic via `apply_operator/4`, and 3) Proper recursion termination for single-number expressions.",
