Here are the extracted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` placeholder in the `<origin_code>`, formatted in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "190031BC","Code": "parse([N], N).\nparse([N, O | Rest], Result) :-\n    parse(Rest, R),\n    (O = + -> Result is N + R;\n     O = - -> Result is N - R;\n     O = * -> Result is N * R;\n     O = / -> Result is N / R)."}
```

This is the only code block that corresponds to the `<langda>` placeholder in the original code, which requested a recursive expression evaluator for arithmetic operations. The hash tag "190031BC" matches the one specified in the placeholder.
