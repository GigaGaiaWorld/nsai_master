  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is intended to recursively evaluate arithmetic expressions by splitting them into sub-expressions based on operator precedence. However, the predicate `split_lowest_precedence/4` is not defined, causing a runtime error. Additionally, the predicate does not account for operator precedence or associativity, which are critical for correct evaluation. The code block needs regeneration to include the missing predicate and properly handle operator precedence.",
