It meets the specified requirements for defining the game rules. There are no syntax or logical errors, and it does not contribute to the test failure. The block is self-contained and does not depend on other code blocks.",

  "Report": "This code block defines the `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates but fails during testing due to the missing `play/3` predicate. The logic for scoring and determining the winner is correct but incomplete without `play/3`. The block depends on the implementation of `play/3` to function properly. Since `play/3` is not provided, this block cannot work as intended.",
