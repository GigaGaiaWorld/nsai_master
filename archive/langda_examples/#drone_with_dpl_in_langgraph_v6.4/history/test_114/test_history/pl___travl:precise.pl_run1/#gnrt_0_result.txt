Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \+ susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

This code implements the requirements specified in the <Langda> block:
1. Contact transmission with different probabilities based on susceptibility
2. Additional infection risk from travel
3. Maintains the initial infection probability from the original code

The hash matches the one provided in the placeholder (E09B4F54), and the code implements all the specified infection logic requirements.
