  "Report": "The `abandon(S,O)` predicate correctly implements the specified requirements by checking the gender of the adult sperm whale (S), the gender of the orca (O), and the position of the adult sperm whale (c). The test results show uniform probabilities, which align with the expected behavior. However, the predicate could benefit from clearer documentation to explicitly state the conditions for abandonment. No syntax or logical errors were found, and the implementation matches the requirements.",
