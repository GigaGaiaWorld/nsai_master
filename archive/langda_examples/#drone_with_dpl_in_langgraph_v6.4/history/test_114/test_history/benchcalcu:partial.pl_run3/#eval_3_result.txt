  "HASH": "1039E900",
  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains logical gaps. The `query_sum` predicate lacks constraints for the digits `S`, `M`, and `O`. The `sumdigit` calls do not fully account for the carry-over logic required for the cryptoaddition problem. Additionally, the `leftdigit` constraint is not properly enforced for `S` and `M`. The test result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating the code fails to produce a valid solution. Recommendations include completing the `query_sum` predicate, enhancing the `sumdigit` logic, and enforcing `leftdigit` constraints.",
