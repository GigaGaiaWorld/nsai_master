  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks constraints for the variables `S` and `M` (leftmost digits). Additionally, the `sumdigit` predicates do not fully account for all carry-over scenarios, leading to logical gaps. The `all_different` constraints are correctly implemented but are not sufficient to solve the puzzle without proper sum constraints. The test result of 0.0000 indicates that the code fails to find a valid solution due to these issues.",
