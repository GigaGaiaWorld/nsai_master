  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and fails to solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle. The `query_sum` predicate lacks critical constraints to ensure the equation SEND + MORE = MONEY is satisfied. The `sumdigit` predicates do not fully account for all carry-over scenarios, and the `all_different` constraints may not be enforced correctly. Additionally, the test result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating no valid solutions are found. The block needs regeneration to include proper constraints for all variables (S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y) and to handle carry-over conditions accurately.",
