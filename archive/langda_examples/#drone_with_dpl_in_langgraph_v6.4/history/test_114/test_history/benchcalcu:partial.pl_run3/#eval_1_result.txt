  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains logical gaps. The `query_sum` predicate lacks proper constraints for the digits `S`, `E`, `N`, `D`, `M`, `O`, `R`, and `Y`. The `sumdigit` predicates do not fully enforce the carry-over logic required for the cryptarithmetic puzzle. Additionally, the `all_different` constraints are not properly integrated into the main predicate. The test result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating the code fails to produce a valid solution.",
