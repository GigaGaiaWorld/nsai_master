Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The origin_code had one <langda> block with hash CFA63C1E, which appears to be for defining the game rules of rock-paper-scissors. However, in the generated_code, these rules were already present in the original code and weren't modified or added to.

The only code that appears to be "completed" in the generated_code is the formatting/indentation of the determine_winner predicate, but this wasn't marked as a <langda> block in the original. Therefore, there isn't actually any new code generated that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder.

Since no new code was generated for the specified <langda> block, I can't provide a valid JSON response with completed code snippets. The game rules that were requested in the <langda> block were already present in the original code.

Would you like me to analyze any other aspects of these code sections?
