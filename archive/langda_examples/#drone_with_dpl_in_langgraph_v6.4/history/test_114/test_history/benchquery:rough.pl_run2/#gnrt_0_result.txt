Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> placeholder in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5738285A", "Code": "% Define density predicate\ndensity(Country, Density) :-\n    pop(Country, Pop),\n    area(Country, Area),\n    Density is Pop / Area."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "5738285A", "Code": "% Define query_pop predicate to find countries with approximately equal population density (not larger than 5%)\nquery_pop(Pairs) :-\n    findall((Country1, Country2), (\n        density(Country1, Density1),\n        density(Country2, Density2),\n        Country1 \\= Country2,\n        abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05\n    ), Pairs)."}
```

Note that both code blocks share the same HASH tag since they both implement the requirements specified in the single <langda> block (defining both the density calculation and the query_pop predicate).
