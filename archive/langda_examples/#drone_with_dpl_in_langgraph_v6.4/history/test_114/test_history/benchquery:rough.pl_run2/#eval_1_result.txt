  "Report": "The `density` predicate is correctly implemented to calculate population density using `pop` and `area` facts. However, it is not utilized in any query or comparison logic. The predicate itself is syntactically and logically correct, but it does not fulfill the requirement of finding countries with approximately equal population densities. The main issue lies in the missing `query_pop` predicate, which should use the `density` predicate to perform the required comparisons.",
