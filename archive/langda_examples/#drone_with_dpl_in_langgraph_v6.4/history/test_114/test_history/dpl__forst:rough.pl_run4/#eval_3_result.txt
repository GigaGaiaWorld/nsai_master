  "Report": "The code block implements a `sort` operation for stacks with at least 3 elements. However, it lacks the `insertion_sort` predicate, which is crucial for sorting the top 3 elements. Additionally, the `get_top_n` predicate incorrectly assumes the stack length is always sufficient, leading to potential failures when the stack has fewer than `N` elements. The test results show that the `sort` operation is not functioning as expected, indicating a need for regeneration.",

  "Report": "The second code block defines the `stack_op` predicate for `sort` but omits the logic for other operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`). The `get_top_n` predicate is also incorrectly implemented, as it does not handle cases where the stack length is less than `N`. The test results show that none of the operations are functioning as expected, indicating a need for regeneration.",
