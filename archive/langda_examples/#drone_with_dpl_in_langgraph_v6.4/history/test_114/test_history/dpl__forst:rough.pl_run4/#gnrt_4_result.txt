Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the missing operations in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "stack_op(pop, [X|Stack], Stack)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "stack_op(dup, [X|Stack], [X,X|Stack])."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "stack_op(swap, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X|Stack])."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "stack_op(over, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X,Y|Stack])."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "stack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Stack], [Y,Z,X|Stack])."}
```

Note that I've used the same HASH value ("5E40E418") for all blocks since they all belong to the same original code section that had this hash. Each block represents one of the missing operations that needed to be implemented (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot).
