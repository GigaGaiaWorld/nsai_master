  "Report": "The code block implements a `sort` operation for a stack, which includes `get_top_n` and `insertion_sort` predicates. The logic for `get_top_n` is mostly correct but could fail if the stack length is less than `N`. The `insertion_sort` predicate is correctly implemented. However, the block only covers the `sort` operation, leaving other required operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) unimplemented. The test results show failures due to these missing operations. The block needs regeneration to include the missing operations and ensure robustness in `get_top_n`.",

{
  "HASH": "N/A (Second block lacks a hash)",
  "Report": "The second code block is incomplete and lacks the conditional logic for `get_top_n` present in the first block. It also includes queries for operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) that are not implemented in the code. This mismatch between the queries and the available logic results in all queries returning 0.0000. The block needs regeneration to either remove the unsupported queries or implement the missing operations. Additionally, the `get_top_n` predicate should be consistent with the first block.",
