This would lead to runtime errors if the `sort` operation is queried. The test cases for `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` fail because their predicate definitions are missing entirely. This code block needs regeneration to include the missing predicate definitions and ensure all specified stack operations are implemented correctly.",
