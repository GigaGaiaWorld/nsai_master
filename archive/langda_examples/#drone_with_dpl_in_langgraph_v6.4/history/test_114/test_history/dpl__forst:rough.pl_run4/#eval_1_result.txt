  "Report": "The code block implements a `sort` operation and a helper predicate `get_top_n`. The `sort` operation retrieves the top 3 elements from the stack, sorts them using `insertion_sort`, and appends them back to the rest of the stack. However, the `insertion_sort` predicate is not defined in the provided code, which would cause a runtime error if the `sort` operation were tested. Additionally, the code lacks implementations for other stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that are queried in the test cases. The test results show zero probabilities for all tested operations, indicating a failure to meet the requirements.",
