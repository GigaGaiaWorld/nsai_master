System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 5E40E418 </HASH>
<Requirements>Implemented a series of stack operations </Requirements></Langda>
.
stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-
 get_top_n(Stack, 3, Elements, RestStack),
 insertion_sort(Elements, SortedElements),
 append(SortedElements, RestStack, SortedStack).
get_top_n(Stack, N, Elements, Rest) :-
 length(Elements, N),
 append(Elements, Rest, Stack).
query(stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],[1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The code partially implements the specified requirements for stack operations. The test results show that only the `push` operation works correctly, while all other operations (`pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) fail with a probability of 0.0000. This indicates that the code lacks implementations for these operations or contains logical errors." </Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> "The primary issue is the absence of predicate definitions for operations like `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. Additionally, the `sort` operation is partially implemented but not tested in the provided queries. The `get_top_n` and `insertion_sort` predicates are referenced but not defined, which would cause runtime errors if invoked." </Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "5E40E418",
        "Report": "The code block `stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).` is syntactically correct and logically implements the `push` operation as required. It successfully passes the test case for `push(1)`."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for the second code block)",
        "Report": "The `sort` operation is partially implemented but lacks the definitions of `get_top_n` and `insertion_sort` predicates. This would lead to runtime errors if the `sort` operation is queried. The test cases for `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` fail because their predicate definitions are missing entirely."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>"1. Implement the missing predicates for `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` operations. 2. Define the `get_top_n` and `insertion_sort` predicates to complete the `sort` operation. 3. Add test cases for the `sort` operation to ensure its correctness. 4. Verify the logical correctness of all operations by testing them with various stack configurations." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
