Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code. Here's the result:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7","Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, S),\n    ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n    ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n    ; Winner = draw\n    )."}
```

Note that I've used the improved version from the generated_code (which uses -> instead of commas for better readability) while maintaining the same hash from the original code block. The generated version is cleaner and more idiomatic Prolog.
