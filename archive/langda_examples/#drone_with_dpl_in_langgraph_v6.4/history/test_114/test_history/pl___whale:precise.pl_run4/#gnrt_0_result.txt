Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> placeholder:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)."}
```

- It checks the gender of adult sperm whale (ID 2) as S
- It checks the gender of orca (ID 3) as O
- It verifies the adult sperm whale is at position c
- When all conditions are met, it means the adult sperm whale abandons the baby whale
