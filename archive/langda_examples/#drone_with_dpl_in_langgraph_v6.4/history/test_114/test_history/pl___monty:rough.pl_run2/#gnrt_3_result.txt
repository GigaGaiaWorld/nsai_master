Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "592D75CA", "Code": "open_door(Door) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    prize(Prize),\n    % Random Door Opening Rules\n    (   Prize \\= Selected,\n        member(Door, [1,2,3]),\n        Door \\= Selected,\n        Door \\= Prize,\n        % Host randomly opens one of the two empty doors with 50% probability\n        (   Door = 1, 0.5::open_door(1)\n        ;   Door = 2, 0.5::open_door(2)\n        ;   Door = 3, 0.5::open_door(3)\n        )\n    ) ;\n    % Deterministic Door Opening Rules\n    (   Prize \\= Selected,\n        member(Door, [1,2,3]),\n        Door \\= Selected,\n        Door \\= Prize,\n        % Host must open the empty door\n        once(open_door(Door))\n    )."}
```

Note that this is the only code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code. The main change in the generated version is the addition of `once/1` to prevent infinite recursion in the deterministic case.
