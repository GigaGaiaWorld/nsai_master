  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has significant issues that require regeneration: 1. Logical Error - The current implementation incorrectly mixes probabilistic and deterministic behavior in a single predicate, failing to properly separate the scenarios where the host must open an empty door (deterministic) versus randomly selecting between two empty doors. 2. Syntax Error - The use of `0.5::open_door(Door)` is invalid ProbLog syntax as probabilities cannot be assigned to predicate calls. 3. Incomplete Implementation - Missing handling for the case where the player's initial selection contains the prize. The predicate needs complete restructuring to properly implement the Monty Hall problem rules.",
