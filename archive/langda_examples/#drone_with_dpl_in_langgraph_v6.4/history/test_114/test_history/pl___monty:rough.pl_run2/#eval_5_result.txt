    "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has significant issues that require regeneration. The main problems are: 1) Invalid syntax with `0.5::open_door(Door)` inside a rule, which violates ProbLog's requirement for probabilistic facts to be defined at the top level; 2) Incomplete implementation of the deterministic behavior when only one 'empty door' remains. The current implementation may not correctly handle all scenarios as specified in the requirements. The predicate needs to be rewritten to properly implement both the random (50% probability) and deterministic door opening behaviors while maintaining correct ProbLog syntax.",
