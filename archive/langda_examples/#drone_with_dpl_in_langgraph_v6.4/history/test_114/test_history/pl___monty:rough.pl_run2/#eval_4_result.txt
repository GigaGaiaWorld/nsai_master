  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate is overly complex and contains redundant logic. The probabilistic rules for opening doors are not correctly implemented, as they do not account for the host's behavior in all scenarios. The deterministic rules are also not clearly separated from the probabilistic ones, leading to potential confusion. Additionally, the use of `member/2` is unnecessary for door selection. The predicate should be simplified to clearly separate probabilistic and deterministic rules, and the host's behavior should be correctly modeled for both scenarios.",
