  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf(X)` predicate with four rules, each correctly implementing the specified probabilities (initial infection, contact transmission for susceptible/non-susceptible individuals, and travel risk). However, the test results show probabilities (0.0316) that are significantly lower than expected, indicating a logical inconsistency in how the probabilities are combined or propagated. The issue likely stems from the rules being treated as mutually exclusive or not being summed/combined correctly. The code block needs regeneration to ensure proper probability combination and alignment with the requirements.",
