System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Code>

person(a).
person(b).
0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).
0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).
0.1::riskyTravel(X) :- person(X).
0.1::susceptible(X) :- person(X).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).
0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \+susceptible(X).
0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).
0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block defines the `inf(X)` predicate with four rules, each correctly implementing the specified probabilities for initial infection, contact transmission (both susceptible and non-susceptible cases), and travel risk. However, the test results show probabilities (0.0316 for `inf(a)` and `inf(b)`) that are significantly lower than expected, indicating an issue with probability aggregation. The rules are treated as independent events, but the combined probability is not calculated correctly. The `susceptible(X)` predicate's impact is also not clearly reflected. Recommendations include: 1) Correctly aggregating probabilities using the formula for independent events, 2) Debugging intermediate queries to verify individual rule probabilities, 3) Ensuring the `susceptible(X)` conditions are correctly evaluated, and 4) Re-running tests after fixes.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
