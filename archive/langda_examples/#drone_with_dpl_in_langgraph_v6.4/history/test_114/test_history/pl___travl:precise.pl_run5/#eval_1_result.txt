  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf(X)` predicate with four rules: initial infection, contact transmission (with and without susceptibility), and travel risk. However, the probabilities are not being combined correctly. The test results show lower probabilities than expected, indicating that the rules are not being applied as intended. Specifically, the `susceptible(X)` predicate is not effectively differentiating between the two contact transmission scenarios, and the probabilities from different sources (initial infection, contact transmission, and travel risk) are not being aggregated properly. The current implementation does not reflect the requirements accurately.",
