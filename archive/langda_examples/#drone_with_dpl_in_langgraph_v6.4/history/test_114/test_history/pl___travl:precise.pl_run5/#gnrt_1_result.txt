Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\n0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

Note that:
1. I've used the same HASH value (E09B4F54) that was provided in the original <Langda> block
2. The code content matches exactly the regenerated inf/1 predicate from the generated_code
3. I've preserved the escape character (\\) before the \+ operator
4. The code is formatted as a single string with newline characters separating the rules
