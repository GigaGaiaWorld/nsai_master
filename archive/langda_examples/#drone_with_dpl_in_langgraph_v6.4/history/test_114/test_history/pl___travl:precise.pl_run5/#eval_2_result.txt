    "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate logic does not correctly combine probabilities from different infection sources (initial infection, contact transmission, and travel risk). The current implementation treats these as independent events, leading to lower-than-expected probabilities in the test results. The requirements suggest these probabilities should be combined additively or multiplicatively, but the code does not reflect this. Additionally, the initial infection probability is not properly integrated with other pathways. The logic for contact transmission (with and without susceptibility) is correctly specified but not effectively combined with other rules.",
