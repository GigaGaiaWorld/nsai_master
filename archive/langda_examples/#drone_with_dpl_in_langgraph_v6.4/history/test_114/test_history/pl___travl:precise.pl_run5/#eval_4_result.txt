  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf(X)` predicate with four rules, each correctly implementing the specified probabilities for initial infection, contact transmission (both susceptible and non-susceptible cases), and travel risk. However, the test results show probabilities (0.0316 for `inf(a)` and `inf(b)`) that are significantly lower than expected, indicating an issue with probability aggregation. The rules are treated as independent events, but the combined probability is not calculated correctly. The `susceptible(X)` predicate's impact is also not clearly reflected. Recommendations include: 1) Correctly aggregating probabilities using the formula for independent events, 2) Debugging intermediate queries to verify individual rule probabilities, 3) Ensuring the `susceptible(X)` conditions are correctly evaluated, and 4) Re-running tests after fixes.",
