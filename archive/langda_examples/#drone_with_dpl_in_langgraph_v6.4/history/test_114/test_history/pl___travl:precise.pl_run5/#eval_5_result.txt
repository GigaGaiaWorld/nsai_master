  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate logic correctly implements the requirements but fails to account for overlapping probabilities (e.g., infection via multiple paths). The probabilities are not additive, leading to lower-than-expected results. The `susceptible/1` predicate's influence is not dynamically reflected in the probabilities. Recommendations: (1) Revise probability aggregation to ensure correct combination, possibly using ProbLog's built-in rules or explicit definitions. (2) Modify `inf/1` rules to dynamically reflect `susceptible/1`'s influence. (3) Test edge cases with mutual contacts or travel risks to verify probability calculations.",
