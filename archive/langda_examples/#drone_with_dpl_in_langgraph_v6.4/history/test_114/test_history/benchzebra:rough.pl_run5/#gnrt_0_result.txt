Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, there is only one <Langda> block that needs to be completed in the origin_code. The corresponding completed code in the generated_code is the line:

```prolog
my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)
```

Here's the formatted JSON response:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```

This is the only code block that was missing in the origin_code (marked by <Langda>) and was completed in the generated_code. All other parts of the code were already present in the origin_code.
