  "Report": "The code block defines a `stack_op(sort, ...)` predicate and a helper `get_top_n` predicate, but it fails to implement the required stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot). Additionally, the `insertion_sort` predicate, which is called in `stack_op(sort, ...)`, is missing, rendering the sorting functionality incomplete. The test results confirm that none of the stack operations work as expected, with all queries returning a probability of 0.0000. The code block needs to be regenerated to include the missing operations and complete the sorting logic.",
