```report
{
  "HASH": "N/A (second block is untagged)",
  "Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete due to the missing `insertion_sort` predicate. The `get_top_n` predicate lacks error handling for stacks with fewer than `N` elements, which could lead to runtime failures. This block is untested and does not fully meet the requirements. Regeneration is needed to implement the missing functionality and add robustness checks.",
