Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The only code block that was modified in the generated_code is the sumdigit constraint for the thousands digit calculation, which was previously marked with the HASH 4623869C in the origin_code.

Here's the extracted and formatted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This corresponds to:
1. The original <Langda> block with hash 4623869C
2. The completed code in generated_code that replaced the <Langda> block (removing the redundant duplicate call)
3. The requirement to calculate the thousands digit with S + M + C3 = O and carry result limited to M
