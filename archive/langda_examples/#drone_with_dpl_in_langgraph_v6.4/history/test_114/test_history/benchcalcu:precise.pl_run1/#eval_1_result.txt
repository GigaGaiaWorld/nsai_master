Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "B6FD3E20", "Report": "The constraint `digit(D), digit(E), D \\= E` correctly ensures that D and E are distinct digits. No issues found. Implementation meets requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "AFCFFD3D", "Report": "The `sumdigit(0, D, E, Y, C1)` correctly calculates the unit digit sum with carry. However, this is repeated later in the code, which is redundant. The logic itself is correct.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["B6FD3E20"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BA7F9BE8", "Report": "The constraint `digit(N), all_different([N,Y,E,D])` correctly assigns N and ensures uniqueness. No issues found. Implementation meets requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["AFCFFD3D"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "3E567069", "Report": "The constraint `digit(R), all_different([R,N,Y,E,D])` correctly assigns R and ensures uniqueness. No issues found. Implementation meets requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["BA7F9BE8"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0BCA612F", "Report": "The `sumdigit(C1, N, R, E, C2)` correctly calculates the tens digit sum with carry. No issues found. Implementation meets requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["3E567069"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "710BBD98", "Report": "The constraint `digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D])` correctly assigns O and ensures uniqueness. No issues found. Implementation meets requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["0BCA612F"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58F57C1C", "Report": "The `sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3)` correctly calculates the hundreds digit sum with carry. No issues found. Implementation meets requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["710BBD98"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "70805326", "Report": "The constraint `leftdigit(S), all_different([S,O,R,N,Y,E,D])` correctly assigns S and ensures uniqueness. No issues found. Implementation meets requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["58F57C1C"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "72F32859", "Report": "The constraint `leftdigit(M), all_different([M,S,O,R,N,Y,E,D])` correctly assigns M and ensures uniqueness. No issues found. Implementation meets requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["70805326"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Report": "The `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` is repeated twice in the code, which is redundant. The logic itself is correct but should be called only once. Needs regeneration to remove redundancy.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["72F32859"]}
```

### Summary:
- Only the code block with hash `4623869C` needs regeneration due to redundancy.
- All other code blocks are correct and meet their requirements.
- Dependencies are noted where a code block relies on the output of another block.
