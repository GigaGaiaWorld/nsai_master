Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code was about the redundant `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` call, which has been fixed in the generated_code by removing the duplicate call. Here's the extracted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This is the only code block that was modified from the <Langda> section in the origin_code. The generated_code removed the redundant call while keeping the logic that calculates the thousands digit S + M + C3 = O with the carry result limited to M.
