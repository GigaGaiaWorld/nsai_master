  "Report": "The code block under this hash is intended to enforce the constraint `S + M + C3 = O` with the carry result limited to `M`. However, the implementation is redundant (called twice) and lacks clarity in enforcing the carry constraint. The `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags are not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed. The block also does not clearly enforce the requirement that the highest digit is M. The test result shows a valid solution, but the redundancy and unclear constraints could lead to issues in other scenarios.",
