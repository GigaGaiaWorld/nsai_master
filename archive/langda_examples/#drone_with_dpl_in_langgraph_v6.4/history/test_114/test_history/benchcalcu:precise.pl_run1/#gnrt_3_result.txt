Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The only code block that needs to be extracted is the one with hash "4623869C" which is the sumdigit predicate that was in the <Langda> section.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with a <Langda> tag in the origin_code and appears in the generated_code. The rest of the code in generated_code either already existed in origin_code or wasn't marked as a <Langda> block.
