  "Report": "The code block under this hash is intended to enforce the constraint `S + M + C3 = O` with the carry result limited to `M`. However, the implementation is redundant (called twice) and does not clearly enforce the requirement. The predicate `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` should be called once, and the logic should explicitly ensure that the carry result is `M`. Additionally, the requirement to limit the carry result to `M` is not clearly implemented in the `sumdigit` predicate. The block needs regeneration to address these issues.",
