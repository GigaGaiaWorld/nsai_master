Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The only code block that matches is the uniform distribution definition for the world predicate:

```problog
{"HASH": "F46C6231", "Code": "1/6::world(a); 1/6::world(b); 1/6::world(c); 1/6::world(d); 1/6::world(e); 1/6::world(f)."}
```

Note that this is the same code block that was identified in the <langda> section of the origin_code, with the same hash value. The generated_code maintains this exact line without modification.
