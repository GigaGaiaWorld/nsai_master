Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code was marked with hash "4623869C" and contained the requirement to calculate the thousands digit with specific constraints. In the generated_code, this was replaced with a proper implementation.

Here's the extracted and formatted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "% Calculate the thousands digit S + M + C3 = O, and limit the carry result to M\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This corresponds to:
1. The hash tag from the original <Langda> block
2. The comment explaining the purpose
3. The actual implementation that was generated to replace the original block
