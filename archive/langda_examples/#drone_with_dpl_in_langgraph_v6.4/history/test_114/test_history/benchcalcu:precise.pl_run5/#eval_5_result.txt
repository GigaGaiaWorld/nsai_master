  "Report": "The code block under this hash is intended to enforce the requirement for the thousands digit calculation (`S + M + C3 = O` with carry `M`). However, the predicate `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` is called twice, which is redundant. Additionally, the logic does not explicitly ensure that the carry result is limited to `M` as required. The block needs regeneration to remove redundancy and clarify the logic to match the requirement.",
