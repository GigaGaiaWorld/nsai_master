Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The only <Langda> block in origin_code has the hash "4623869C" and corresponds to the sumdigit predicate for calculating the thousands digit. In the generated_code, this appears as a single instance (removing the duplication mentioned in the report).

Here's the extracted code block in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```
