Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The relevant code block from generated_code is:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This is the only code block that was generated to replace the <Langda> section in the original code. The generated code removed the redundant duplicate call to sumdigit that was present in the original code, while maintaining the core functionality of calculating the thousands digit with the carry result limited to M.

Note that the hash "4623869C" is preserved from the original <Langda> section to maintain traceability between the original requirement and the generated code.
