  "Report": "The code block implements the required addition logic correctly and produces the expected result (11) for the test case addition(img_5,img_6,Z). However, there are several issues that need attention: 1) The ProbLog rule is not properly formatted (split across lines without proper termination), 2) The <Langda> and <Code_Block> tags are not valid ProbLog syntax, 3) The <HASH> and <Requirements> tags are unnecessary in the executable code. While the logic itself is correct, the presentation needs regeneration to conform to proper ProbLog syntax standards.",
