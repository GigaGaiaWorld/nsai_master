Based on the provided analysis and evaluation instructions, here is the structured report for the given code block:

```report
{
    "HASH": "6E46AD63",
    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the addition logic as specified in the requirements. It successfully extracts numeric values from digit-labeled images (img_1 to img_0) and performs addition. The test case `addition(img_5,img_6,Z)` yields the correct result (11), confirming the logic works as intended. No syntax or logical errors were found. The implementation fully meets the requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false,
    "Dependencies": []
}
```

### Reasoning:
1. **Correctness**: The code is syntactically correct and logically sound.
2. **Requirements**: Fully implements the specified addition logic with digit-labeled images.
3. **Testing**: Passes the provided test case with expected results.
4. **Dependencies**: None - this is a self-contained predicate that doesn't rely on other code blocks needing regeneration.
5. **Recommendations**: While no regeneration is needed, additional test cases could further validate edge cases (e.g., `img_0 + img_9`). This is optional for robustness.
