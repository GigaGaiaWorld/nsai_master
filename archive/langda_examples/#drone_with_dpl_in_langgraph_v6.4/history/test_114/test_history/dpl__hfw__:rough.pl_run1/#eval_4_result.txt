  "Report": "The 'parse/2' predicate contains critical syntax errors that prevent proper execution, as evidenced by the 'UnmatchedCharacter' error during testing. The implementation attempts to handle operator precedence through nested conditionals and a custom 'select/5' predicate, which appears incompatible with ProbLog's syntax rules. The predicate fails to properly parse arithmetic expressions due to these structural issues. Additionally, the division handling lacks proper error messaging for division-by-zero cases.",
