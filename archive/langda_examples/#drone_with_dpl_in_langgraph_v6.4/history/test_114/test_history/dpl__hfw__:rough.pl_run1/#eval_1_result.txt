  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate fails to correctly evaluate nested arithmetic expressions due to improper handling of operator precedence and associativity. The current implementation evaluates operations strictly left-to-right without considering operator precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction). Additionally, the recursive cases do not properly accumulate intermediate results, leading to incorrect final values. The test result (0.0000) confirms this failure. The code needs to be regenerated to implement proper operator precedence and correct recursive evaluation.",
