</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code aims to implement a recursive expression evaluator in ProbLog, capable of parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. While the logic for parsing and evaluating expressions is mostly correct, the test results indicate a critical issue with clause resolution, specifically an "UnknownClause" error. This suggests that the parser is not correctly handling the input or the clauses are not being resolved as expected.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **UnknownClause Error**: The error message indicates that the parser cannot find clauses for the division operation (`/2`). This likely stems from a mismatch between the detected symbols and the expected format in the `parse/2` predicate.
2. **Integration Issue**: The `detect_all/2` predicate does not properly integrate with the `parse/2` predicate, leading to unresolved clauses during evaluation.
3. **Logical Gap**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate is defined but unused, which may indicate incomplete logic for handling floating-point comparisons.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "190031BC",
        "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is logically sound for evaluating arithmetic expressions, but it fails to handle the input format correctly. The error suggests that the division operator (`/`) is not being passed in the expected format (e.g., as an atom or string). Additionally, the predicate does not account for operator precedence, which could lead to incorrect evaluations for complex expressions."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Input Format**: Ensure the `detect_operator/2` predicate outputs operators in the exact format expected by `parse/2` (e.g., as atoms like `'/'`).
2. **Debug `detect_all/2`**: Verify that `detect_all/2` correctly transforms the input list of images into a list of symbols (numbers and operators) that `parse/2` can process.
3. **Add Operator Precedence**: Modify `parse/2` to handle operator precedence, possibly by restructuring the clauses or using a more sophisticated parsing strategy.
4. **Remove Unused Predicate**: Remove or integrate the `almost_equal/2` predicate if it is not needed for the current logic.
5. **Test Incrementally**: Test the `detect_all/2` and `parse/2` predicates separately to isolate and resolve integration issues.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
