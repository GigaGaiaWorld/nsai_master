  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate fails to enforce operator precedence, causing incorrect evaluation of arithmetic expressions. For example, multiplication and division should take precedence over addition and subtraction, but the current implementation processes operators left-to-right without considering precedence. Additionally, the predicate does not handle division by zero or invalid operations gracefully. The test result shows an incorrect output (0.0000) for the query, confirming the logical flaw. The predicate also lacks integration with `almost_equal/2` for floating-point comparisons.",
