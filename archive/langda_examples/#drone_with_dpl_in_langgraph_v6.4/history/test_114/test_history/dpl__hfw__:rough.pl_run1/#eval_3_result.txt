  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate has significant logical flaws. It fails to enforce operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation of expressions. For example, multiplication and division should take precedence over addition and subtraction, but the current implementation processes operators left-to-right without regard for precedence. Additionally, the base case `parse([N], N)` does not handle nested expressions properly, causing premature termination. The division by zero check is present but may not propagate failures correctly. The predicate also lacks robustness in handling complex expressions with multiple operators of mixed precedence.",
