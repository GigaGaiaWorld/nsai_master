  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is logically sound for evaluating arithmetic expressions but fails due to input format mismatches and lack of operator precedence handling. The error indicates that the division operator (`/`) is not being passed in the expected format. Additionally, the predicate does not account for operator precedence, which could lead to incorrect evaluations for complex expressions. Recommendations include fixing the input format to ensure operators are passed as atoms (e.g., `'/'`), debugging the `detect_all/2` predicate to ensure correct symbol transformation, and modifying `parse/2` to handle operator precedence.",
