Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in the original code:

```report
{"HASH": "0C388A60", "Report": "The code block `move(paper).` is correct and fulfills the requirement of defining the move for paper. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Report": "The code block `move(scissor).` has a typo. It should be `move(scissors).` for consistency with the rest of the code. This inconsistency could cause confusion or errors in future extensions.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["58D60F5E"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "59C3D0D4", "Report": "The code block `beats(paper, rock).` is correct and fulfills the requirement of defining the win-lose relationship for paper. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E", "Report": "The code block `beats(scissor, paper).` is logically correct but uses the inconsistent move name `scissor` (should be `scissors`). This depends on the corrected move definition (HASH BF964057).", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["BF964057"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "94C4D48B", "Report": "The code block `compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.` is correct and fulfills the requirement for the lose case. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "026B015E", "Report": "The code block `compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S).` is correct but could be optimized to avoid redundant recursion (e.g., using an accumulator). However, this is a minor improvement and not critical for functionality.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

### Summary of Regenerations Needed:
1. **HASH BF964057**: Needs regeneration due to the typo (`scissor` â†’ `scissors`).
2. **HASH 58D60F5E**: Needs regeneration due to dependency on the corrected move definition (HASH BF964057).

The other code blocks are correct and do not require regeneration.
