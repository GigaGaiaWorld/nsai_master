System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code is intended to solve the classic "zebra puzzle," which involves deducing the arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given clues. The code appears to be logically structured but is incomplete and contains syntax issues, leading to a timeout error during testing. The timeout suggests that the solver is unable to find a solution within the allotted time, likely due to missing constraints or incorrect logic.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Error**: The code is incomplete, as indicated by the placeholder `<Langda>` and the requirement to "complete the rules." This prevents the code from being syntactically valid.
2. **Logical Incompleteness**: The puzzle requires all constraints to be fully specified, but some rules are missing or incomplete (e.g., the `my_member` rule for the yellow house is partially provided but not integrated correctly).
3. **Timeout Error**: The solver times out, indicating that the constraints may not be sufficient or are causing an infinite loop or excessive computation.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "0F506A43",
        "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is incomplete and lacks integration into the main `zebra` predicate. This rule is a critical part of the puzzle but is not properly connected to the rest of the constraints."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Complete the Rules**: Ensure all constraints for the puzzle are fully specified and integrated into the `zebra` predicate. For example, the `my_member` rule for the yellow house should be properly placed within the predicate.
2. **Debug Syntax**: Fix any syntax errors, such as the incomplete `<Langda>` placeholder, to make the code syntactically valid.
3. **Optimize Constraints**: Review the constraints to ensure they are not causing excessive computation. For example, ensure that the `next_to` and `right_of` predicates are correctly implemented and do not lead to redundant checks.
4. **Test Incrementally**: Test the code incrementally by adding one constraint at a time to identify which part may be causing the timeout.
5. **Use ProbLog Debugging Tools**: Utilize ProbLog's debugging tools to trace the execution and identify bottlenecks or logical errors.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
