Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code appears after the first two my_member predicates and before the house(yellow...) predicate. In the generated_code, this corresponds to the third my_member predicate about the yellow house with kools.

Here's the extracted code block in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```

This is the only code block that was missing in the origin_code (marked by <langda>) and appears completed in the generated_code. The hash matches the one provided in the <langda> block's <HASH> tag.
