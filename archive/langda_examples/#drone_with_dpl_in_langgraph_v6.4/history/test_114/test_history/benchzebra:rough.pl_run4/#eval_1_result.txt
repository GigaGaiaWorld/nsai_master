  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is a critical part of the puzzle but is not properly integrated into the main `zebra` predicate. The block is syntactically correct but appears redundant as it is duplicated in the main predicate. This redundancy could lead to inefficiencies or confusion. The block should be removed from the `<Langda>` section and only kept in the main predicate to avoid duplication. The timeout error is likely due to broader issues in the puzzle's constraints rather than this specific block, but cleaning up redundancy is recommended.",
