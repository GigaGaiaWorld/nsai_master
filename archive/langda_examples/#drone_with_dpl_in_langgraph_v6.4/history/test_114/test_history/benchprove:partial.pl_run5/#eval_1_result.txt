Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in the original code:

```report
{
  "HASH": "99C92279",
  "Report": "The `implies(P,Q)` predicate correctly implements logical implication (P â‡’ Q) using negation-as-failure (`\+ prove(P)`) or provability of Q (`prove(Q)`). The implementation meets the requirements, and the test results confirm its correctness. No regeneration is needed, but documentation could be improved to clarify the semantics of weak implication.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "1405B337",
  "Report": "The `opposite(P)` predicate correctly implements negation-as-failure (`\+ prove(P)`), which is standard in Prolog/ProbLog for negation. The test results confirm it works as expected. No regeneration is needed, but documentation could note that this is not classical negation.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "C68F7B35",
  "Report": "The `extend(List,Elem,Extended)` predicate correctly implements the requirement by prepending `Elem` to `List` to form `Extended`. The test results confirm its correctness. No regeneration is needed, but the predicate could be extended for broader utility (e.g., appending to the tail).",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "0F69CE0F",
  "Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` predicate correctly computes `Y` as `X*2`. The test results confirm its correctness. No regeneration is needed, but the `expand/2` predicate could be generalized to support other operations (e.g., string manipulation, list operations) for broader utility.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

### Summary:
- None of the code blocks require regeneration, as all meet their requirements and pass tests.
- Minor improvements (documentation, generalization) are recommended but do not necessitate regeneration.
- No dependencies between code blocks were identified.
