Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> block in the <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "06576BEB", "Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :-\n    digit(H, D),\n    number(T, N1),\n    N is N1 * 10 + D."}
```

This is the only code block that was needed to complete the <langda> placeholder in the original code. The block defines the `number` predicate that converts a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values, as specified in the requirements.
