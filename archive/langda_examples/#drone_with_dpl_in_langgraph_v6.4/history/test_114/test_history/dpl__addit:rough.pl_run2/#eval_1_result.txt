  "Report": "The `number` predicate is logically correct and fulfills the basic requirements of converting a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. However, it lacks error handling for edge cases such as empty lists or invalid image IDs. The code is syntactically valid and works correctly for the provided test case. The `digit` facts are correctly defined but should be enclosed in a proper ProbLog program block for clarity and consistency.",

  "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate is not part of the original requirements but works as intended for the given test case. It could be improved by adding error handling for invalid inputs. Since it is not a core requirement, regeneration is not strictly necessary unless additional functionality or robustness is desired.",
