Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in the original code:

```report
{
  "HASH": "99C92279",
  "Report": "The `prove(implies(P,Q))` predicate correctly implements the logical implication 'P â‡’ Q' by checking if P is unprovable or Q is provable. The implementation is logically correct and passes all tests. However, the documentation could be enhanced to explicitly state its logical equivalence to avoid confusion. No regeneration is needed for functionality, but documentation updates are recommended.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "1405B337",
  "Report": "The `prove(opposite(P))` predicate correctly implements the negation of P by checking if P is unprovable. It is functionally identical to `prove(refute(P))`, which could lead to redundancy. While the implementation is correct, consider consolidating these predicates or documenting their equivalence to avoid confusion. No regeneration is needed for functionality, but refactoring or documentation updates are recommended.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "C68F7B35",
  "Report": "The `prove(extend(List,Elem,Extended))` predicate correctly extends the list by adding `Elem` to its head. The implementation is straightforward, meets the requirements, and passes all tests. No issues identified. No regeneration needed.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "0F69CE0F",
  "Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` rule correctly computes Y as X*2. The implementation meets the requirements and passes all tests. However, it lacks error handling for cases where X is not a numeric value. While regeneration is not strictly necessary, adding type-checking or validation could improve robustness. This is a low-priority improvement.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

### Summary:
- No code blocks require regeneration for functionality, as all implementations are correct and pass tests.
- Minor improvements are recommended for documentation (`99C92279`, `1405B337`) and error handling (`0F69CE0F`), but these do not necessitate regeneration.
- No dependencies between code blocks require regeneration.
