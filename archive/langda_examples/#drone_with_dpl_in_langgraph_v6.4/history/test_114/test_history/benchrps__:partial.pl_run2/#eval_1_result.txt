Here are the structured reports for each code block that needs evaluation:

```report
{"HASH": "0C388A60", "Report": "The code block defines `move(paper).` correctly, fulfilling the requirement. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Report": "The code block defines `move(scissor).` with a typo. It should be `move(scissors).` for consistency with the game's standard terminology.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["58D60F5E"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "59C3D0D4", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(paper, rock).` correctly, fulfilling the requirement. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(scissor, paper).` with the same typo (`scissor` instead of `scissors`). This should be corrected for consistency.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["BF964057"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "94C4D48B", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` rule for the `lose` case correctly. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "026B015E", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` rule for the `draw` case correctly. However, the base case `compute_score([], 0).` is redundant since the recursive cases cover all possibilities.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

### Summary of Dependencies:
- The code block with `HASH: BF964057` (`move(scissor).`) depends on the correction of `HASH: 58D60F5E` (`beats(scissor, paper).`), and vice versa, due to the shared typo in `scissor`. Both should be regenerated to use `scissors` for consistency. 

No other code blocks require regeneration or have dependencies.
