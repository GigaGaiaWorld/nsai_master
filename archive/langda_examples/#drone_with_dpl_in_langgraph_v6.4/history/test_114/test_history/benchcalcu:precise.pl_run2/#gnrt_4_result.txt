Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code had the hash "4623869C" and was about the sumdigit constraint for the thousands digit calculation. In the generated_code, this appears as a single line (without redundancy) that implements the required constraint.

Here's the extracted code block in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This is the only code block that was generated to replace the <Langda> section from the original code. The generated version correctly implements the requirement to calculate the thousands digit (S + M + C3 = O) with the carry result limited to M, and it does so without the redundancy that was present in the original code.
