Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. Here's the JSON formatted result:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

Note: The generated_code appears to be identical to the origin_code in this case, and there's only one <Langda> block with its corresponding code snippet to extract. The redundant duplicate of this predicate that was mentioned in the report is present in both versions of the code.
