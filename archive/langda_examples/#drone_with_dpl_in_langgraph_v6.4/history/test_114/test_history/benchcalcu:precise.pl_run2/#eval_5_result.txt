  "Report": "The `<Langda>` block contains the `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` predicate, which is duplicated in the main code. This redundancy is unnecessary and could lead to confusion. Additionally, the requirement for the thousands digit calculation (`S + M + C3 = O` with carry `M`) is not clearly enforced in the logic. The `<Langda>` block itself is not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed or replaced with proper comments or code. The predicate should be consolidated into a single call with clear constraints to ensure correctness.",
