Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The relevant code block in the generated_code is the implementation of the thousands digit calculation that was previously marked with the <Langda> tag in the origin_code (hash 4623869C).

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This is:
1. The exact code block that was marked with <Langda> in the origin_code
2. Matches the hash provided in the origin_code (4623869C)
3. Represents the implementation of the thousands digit calculation (S + M + C3 = O with carry M) as specified in the requirements
4. Note that the generated_code removed the duplicate occurrence of this line that was present in the origin_code
