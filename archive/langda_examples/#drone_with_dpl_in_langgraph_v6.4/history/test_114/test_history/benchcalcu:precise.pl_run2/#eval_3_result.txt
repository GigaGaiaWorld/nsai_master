  "HASH": "4623869C",
  "Report": "The code block under this hash is intended to enforce the constraint `S + M + C3 = O` with the carry result limited to `M`. However, the implementation relies on the `sumdigit` predicate, which does not explicitly ensure that the carry result is `M`. Additionally, the block is duplicated in the code, leading to redundancy. The block should be regenerated to explicitly enforce the constraint and remove redundancy.",
