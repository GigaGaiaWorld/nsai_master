Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\n0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

This code block:
1. Matches the hash tag E09B4F54 from the placeholder
2. Implements all the requirements specified in the placeholder:
   - Initial infection (first line)
   - Contact transmission with different probabilities for susceptible/non-susceptible cases
   - Additional travel risk probability
3. Uses the correct Problog syntax with probabilistic facts and rules
