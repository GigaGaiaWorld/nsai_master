  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with four separate rules, each representing a different source of infection. However, the probabilities are not combined correctly. The current implementation treats these as independent events, leading to lower-than-expected probabilities. The test results show probabilities of 0.0316 for both `inf(a)` and `inf(b)`, which are much lower than the expected values based on the requirements. The code needs to be revised to correctly aggregate probabilities from all sources of infection, using ProbLog's built-in probability combination mechanisms.",
