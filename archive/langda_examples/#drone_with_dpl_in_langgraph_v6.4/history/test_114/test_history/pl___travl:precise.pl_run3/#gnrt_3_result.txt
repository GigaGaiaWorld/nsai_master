Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <Langda> block in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\n0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\ninf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\ninf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\ninf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

Note that I've used the same HASH value for both code blocks since they both correspond to the same <Langda> section in the original code. The first block contains the probabilistic rules, while the second block contains the deterministic versions that help with probability aggregation.
