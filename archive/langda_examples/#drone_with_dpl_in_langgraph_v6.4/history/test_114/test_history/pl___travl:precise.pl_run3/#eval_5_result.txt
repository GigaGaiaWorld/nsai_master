  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with four rules: initial infection, contact transmission (with and without susceptibility), and travel risk. The main issues are: 1) The probabilities are not combining correctly (resulting in unexpectedly low values), 2) The susceptibility condition isn't producing the expected probability differences (0.6 vs 0.8), and 3) The travel risk probability isn't properly additive with other infection sources. The test results (0.0316) confirm these issues as they don't match expected values from the requirements.",
