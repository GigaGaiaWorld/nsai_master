  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with four rules that individually implement the required probabilities (initial infection, contact transmission for susceptible/non-susceptible individuals, and travel risk). However, the test results show lower probabilities than expected, indicating that the rules are not correctly combined to reflect cumulative risk. The main issue is the lack of probability aggregation (e.g., noisy-or) to account for multiple infection sources. The logic for susceptibility is correctly implemented but not effectively integrated into the final probability calculation.",
