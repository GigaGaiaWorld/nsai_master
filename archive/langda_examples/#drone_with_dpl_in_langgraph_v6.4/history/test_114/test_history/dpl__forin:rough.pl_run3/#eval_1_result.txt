  "Report": "The code block implements the insertion sort algorithm correctly in ProbLog. The base and recursive cases for `insert/3` and `insertion_sort/2` are well-defined and handle all edge cases. The test result confirms the logical correctness of the implementation with a probability of 1.0000. No syntax or logical errors were found, and the requirements are fully met.",
