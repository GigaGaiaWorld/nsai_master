System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>% Insertion Sort in ProbLog

% Base case: inserting an element into an empty list results in a list with that element.
insert(X, [], [X]).

% Recursive case: insert X into a sorted list [Y|Ys].
% If X <= Y, insert X at the front.
% Otherwise, insert X into the rest of the list Ys.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :- X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :- X > Y, insert(X, Ys, Zs).

% Base case: sorting an empty list results in an empty list.
insertion_sort([], []).

% Recursive case: sort the list [X|Xs] by inserting X into the sorted version of Xs.
insertion_sort([X|Xs], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(Xs, SortedXs),
    insert(X, SortedXs, Sorted).

% Query example
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 501F546D </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements an insertion sort algorithm, and the test result confirms that it correctly sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct, fulfilling the specified requirements. The integration of the code blocks (base and recursive cases for `insert/3` and `insertion_sort/2`) works seamlessly.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No errors were identified in the code. The implementation adheres to the requirements, and the test result validates its correctness.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "501F546D",
        "Report": "The code block implements the insertion sort algorithm correctly. The base and recursive cases for `insert/3` and `insertion_sort/2` are well-defined and handle all edge cases (e.g., empty lists, single-element lists, and larger lists). The test result confirms the logical correctness of the implementation."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Testing**: While the provided test case is correct, additional test cases could be added to further validate the robustness of the implementation. For example:
   - Sorting an already sorted list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
   - Sorting a list with duplicate elements (e.g., `[3, 1, 2, 1]`).
   - Sorting an empty list (`[]`).

2. **Documentation**: Adding comments to explain the logic of each predicate (e.g., `insert/3` and `insertion_sort/2`) would improve readability and maintainability, especially for larger projects.

3. **Performance**: For educational purposes, the implementation is clear and correct. However, in a real-world scenario, the performance of insertion sort (O(n^2)) might not be optimal for large lists. Consider mentioning this limitation in the documentation.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
