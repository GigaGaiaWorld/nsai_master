  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the recursive sorting of the tail list and insertion of the head element into the sorted list, fulfilling the requirements. However, it lacks explicit handling for single-element lists, which could improve clarity and robustness. The predicate `insert_element` is used correctly but could be optimized by removing redundant comparisons. The test results confirm the code works for the given input, but edge cases should be tested further.",
