System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DA97FB01 </HASH>
<Requirements>1.recursively sort the tail list, 2.insert the head element H into the sorted list </Requirements></Langda>
.
insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
 X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
 X > H,
 insert_element(X, T, RT).
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.
<original_code>

insertion_sort([], []).

<Langda>
<Code_Block>insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DA97FB01 </HASH>
<Requirements>1.recursively sort the tail list, 2.insert the head element H into the sorted list </Requirements></Langda>
.
insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
 X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
 X > H,
 insert_element(X, T, RT).
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements an insertion sort algorithm, and the test results indicate that it correctly sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the given test case. However, a thorough analysis reveals potential issues in the implementation that could affect its robustness or correctness for other inputs.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Missing Base Case Handling**: The base case for `insertion_sort` is correctly defined for an empty list, but the recursive case assumes the tail list is non-empty. While this works for the given test case, it may not handle edge cases like single-element lists gracefully.
2. **Redundant Comparison in `insert_element`**: The predicate `insert_element` includes a redundant comparison `X =< H` and `X > H`. While this does not affect correctness, it could be optimized for clarity and performance.
3. **Potential Infinite Recursion**: If the input list contains duplicate elements, the current implementation may not handle them optimally, though it does not fail.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "DA97FB01",
        "Report": "The recursive case for `insertion_sort` correctly implements the requirement to sort the tail list and insert the head element. However, it lacks explicit handling for single-element lists, which could be added for clarity. The predicate `insert_element` is used as intended, but its logic could be simplified."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Explicit Handling of Single-Element Lists**: Add a clause to handle single-element lists in `insertion_sort` for clarity and robustness.
2. **Optimize `insert_element`**: Simplify the `insert_element` predicate by removing redundant comparisons. For example, the second clause could be merged into the first by using a single comparison.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Include test cases for edge scenarios such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate elements to ensure the code's correctness and robustness.
4. **Document Assumptions**: Clearly document any assumptions about the input (e.g., uniqueness of elements) to avoid misuse of the predicate.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
