    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog as evidenced by the successful test case. The predicates are logically sound and syntactically correct. However, the code could be improved by: 1) Adding input validation for non-integer elements, 2) Including more detailed comments for maintainability, and 3) Testing with additional edge cases (empty lists, singleton lists, duplicates). These are enhancements rather than critical issues requiring regeneration.",
