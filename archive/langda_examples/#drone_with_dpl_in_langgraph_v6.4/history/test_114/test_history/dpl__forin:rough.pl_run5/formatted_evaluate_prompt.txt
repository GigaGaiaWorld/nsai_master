System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>% Insertion Sort in ProbLog

% Base case: inserting an element into an empty list
insert(X, [], [X]).

% Recursive case: insert X into the sorted list [Y|Ys]
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :- X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :- X > Y, insert(X, Ys, Zs).

% Base case: an empty list is already sorted
insertion_sort([], []).

% Recursive case: sort the tail and insert the head into the sorted tail
insertion_sort([X|Xs], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(Xs, SortedTail),
    insert(X, SortedTail, Sorted).

% Query example
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 501F546D </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Code_Block>% Insertion Sort in ProbLog

% Base case: inserting an element into an empty list
insert(X, [], [X]).

% Recursive case: insert X into the sorted list [Y|Ys]
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :- X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :- X > Y, insert(X, Ys, Zs).

% Base case: an empty list is already sorted

% Recursive case: sort the tail and insert the head into the sorted tail
insertion_sort([X|Xs], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(Xs, SortedTail),
    insert(X, SortedTail, Sorted).

query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The provided ProbLog code implements an insertion sort algorithm and appears to be syntactically correct. The test result confirms that the code successfully sorts the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating logical correctness for the given example. However, the code lacks robustness checks and edge case handling, which could lead to issues in more complex scenarios." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No critical errors were identified in the code. The implementation meets the specified requirements for the given test case. However, potential issues include:
1. Lack of handling for non-integer or mixed-type lists.
2. No validation for empty or singleton lists (though the base case is correctly implemented).
3. The code does not account for duplicate elements, though this is not a requirement." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "501F546D",
        "Report": "The code block implements the insertion sort algorithm correctly for the provided example. The predicates `insert/3` and `insertion_sort/2` are logically sound and syntactically valid. However, the code could benefit from additional comments or documentation to clarify the logic for future maintainability. Additionally, edge cases (e.g., lists with non-integer elements) are not addressed."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"To improve the code, consider the following:
1. Add input validation to handle non-integer or mixed-type lists.
2. Include comments to explain the logic of each predicate for better readability.
3. Test the code with additional edge cases, such as empty lists, singleton lists, and lists with duplicate elements, to ensure robustness.
4. If the requirement expands to include probabilistic elements (e.g., uncertain inputs), adapt the code to use ProbLog's probabilistic features." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
