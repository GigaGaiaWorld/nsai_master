  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate is syntactically incorrect due to unmatched parentheses and missing clauses. The `findall/3` calls are improperly structured, and the logic for deterministic and random door-opening scenarios is not correctly implemented. Specifically: (1) The `random_member/2` call is incomplete and lacks proper context. (2) The deterministic case incorrectly uses `findall/3` with a list constructor `[Door]` instead of properly filtering doors. (3) The overall predicate structure doesn't clearly separate the two required scenarios (random vs deterministic door opening). The code needs complete restructuring to properly implement both the 50% probability random selection of empty doors when the player initially selects the prize door, and the deterministic selection of the single empty door when the player initially selects a non-prize door.",
