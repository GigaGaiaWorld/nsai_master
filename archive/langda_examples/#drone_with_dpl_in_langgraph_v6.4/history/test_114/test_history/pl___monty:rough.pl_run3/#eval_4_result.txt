  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has the following issues:\n1. **Syntax Error**: The conditional logic (`->`) is not properly formatted for ProbLog. ProbLog requires probabilistic constructs like `prob::` or `P::` for conditional probabilities, which are missing here.\n2. **Logical Flaws**: The implementation does not correctly model the 50% probability for randomly selecting one of the two empty doors. The `random_select/2` call lacks probabilistic weighting.\n3. **Deterministic Case**: The logic for the deterministic case (where one remaining door has a prize) is incomplete. The host should always open the empty door, but the current implementation does not enforce this rule.\n4. **Integration Issues**: The predicate relies on `select_door/1` and `prize/1`, but the logic does not fully align with the Monty Hall problem's requirements.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible probabilistic constructs.\n- Explicitly model the 50% probability for random door selection using `P::` syntax.\n- Refine the deterministic case to always open the empty door.\n- Test the predicate in isolation to verify behavior before integration.",
