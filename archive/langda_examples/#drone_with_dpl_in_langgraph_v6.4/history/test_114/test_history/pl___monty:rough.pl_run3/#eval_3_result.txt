  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has critical issues that require regeneration. The primary problem is the use of an undefined predicate `random_member/2`, which causes the code to fail during execution. Additionally, the logic for randomly selecting a door when the player's initial choice matches the prize door is incomplete and does not implement the required 50% probability rule. While the deterministic case (when the player's initial choice does not match the prize door) is handled correctly, the overall implementation does not fully align with the specified requirements. The predicate needs to be rewritten to include proper random selection logic and ensure correct probability handling.",
