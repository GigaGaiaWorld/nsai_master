Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "592D75CA", "Code": "open_door(Door) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    prize(Prize),\n    (   Prize = Selected ->\n        findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \\+ (D = Selected), \\+ prize(D)), Doors),\n        length(Doors, Len),\n        Len > 0,\n        random_select(Door, Doors)\n    ;   Prize \\= Selected ->\n        findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \\+ (D = Selected), \\+ prize(D)), [Door])\n    )."}
```

Key changes made in the generated code:
1. Replaced `random_member/2` with `random_select/2` which is the correct predicate for random selection
2. Added conditional operators (`->`) to make the logic clearer
3. Maintained the same core functionality while fixing the issues mentioned in the report
