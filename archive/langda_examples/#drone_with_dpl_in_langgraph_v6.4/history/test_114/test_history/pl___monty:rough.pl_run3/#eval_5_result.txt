  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has significant issues that require regeneration. Key problems include: 1) Invalid ProbLog syntax using `->` for conditionals, 2) Incorrect implementation of probabilistic door selection (50% case), 3) Overly complex deterministic case handling, 4) Invalid use of `door_prob/2` predicate. The code fails to properly implement both the random and deterministic door-opening scenarios as specified in the requirements. The test failure confirms these implementation issues.",
