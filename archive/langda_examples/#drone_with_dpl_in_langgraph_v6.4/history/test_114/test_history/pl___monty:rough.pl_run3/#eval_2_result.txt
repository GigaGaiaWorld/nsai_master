  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has several critical issues that require regeneration: 1. Syntax error with the conditional operator `->` which is not properly formatted for ProbLog. 2. Missing implementation of `random_member/2` which is crucial for the random selection of doors. 3. Overly complex logic that doesn't clearly separate the two required scenarios (random vs deterministic door opening). 4. The current implementation doesn't fully align with the Monty Hall problem's rules as specified in the requirements. The predicate needs to be rewritten to handle both scenarios cleanly and use proper ProbLog syntax for conditionals and random selection.",
