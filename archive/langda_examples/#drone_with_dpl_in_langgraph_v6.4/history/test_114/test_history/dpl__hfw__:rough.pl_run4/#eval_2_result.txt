  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate correctly implements recursive evaluation for arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as required. It passes the given test case and handles the recursive evaluation of expressions. However, it lacks error handling for division by zero, which could cause runtime errors. Additionally, it assumes all inputs are valid, which might not always be the case in real-world scenarios. The predicate is syntactically correct and integrates well with the `detect_all/2` predicate. The absence of edge-case handling (e.g., division by zero) is a minor issue but does not warrant regeneration unless robustness is a critical requirement.",
