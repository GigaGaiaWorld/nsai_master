{"HASH": "E09B4F54","Report": "The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with probabilities for different infection sources (contact transmission, risky travel, initial infection). However, the test results show significantly lower probabilities than expected, indicating improper probability combination. The rules do not account for cumulative effects of multiple infection paths (e.g., a person could be infected via both contact and risky travel). The requirements specify higher probabilities (e.g., 0.8 for susceptible contact transmission), but the implementation fails to reflect this.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
