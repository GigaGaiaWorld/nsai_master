System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Code>

person(a).
person(b).
0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).
0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).
0.1::riskyTravel(X) :- person(X).
0.1::susceptible(X) :- person(X).

<Code_Block>0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \+susceptible(X).
0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).
0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X).
0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with four rules for infection probability. Key issues identified:
1. Probability combination: The rules don't properly account for overlapping infection sources (contact, travel, initial). The current implementation treats them as mutually exclusive rather than cumulative.
2. Susceptibility impact: While the rules differentiate between susceptible and non-susceptible cases, the test results don't reflect this distinction.
3. Low result values: The output probabilities (0.0316) are much lower than expected from the specified requirements.

Recommendations:
1. Revise probability combination logic to properly accumulate risks from different sources.
2. Verify the implementation of susceptibility logic.
3. Consider using ProbLog's probability combination mechanisms or explicitly define how probabilities should combine.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
