  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with four rules, but there are significant issues:\n1. The probabilities in the test results (0.0316) are much lower than expected, indicating incorrect probability combination.\n2. The rules treat infection sources as mutually exclusive rather than accounting for cumulative probabilities.\n3. The negation `\\+susceptible(X)` may not be working as intended.\n4. The implementation doesn't properly reflect the requirements for combining infection probabilities from different sources.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Redesign the probability combination logic to properly accumulate infection risks.\n2. Consider using explicit probability combination formulas.\n3. Verify the negation operator's behavior.\n4. Ensure the implementation matches the requirement of independent infection sources.",
