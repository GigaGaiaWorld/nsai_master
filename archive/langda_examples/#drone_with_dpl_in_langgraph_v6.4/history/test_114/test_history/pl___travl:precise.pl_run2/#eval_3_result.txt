  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with four rules that individually appear correct based on the requirements. However, the test results show significantly lower probabilities than expected (0.0316 vs expected higher values), indicating an issue with probability aggregation. The rules for contact transmission, travel risk, and initial infection are not combining as intended. The current implementation may be treating these as mutually exclusive rather than independent probabilities. The logic for susceptibility is correctly implemented in the rules but not reflected in the results.",
