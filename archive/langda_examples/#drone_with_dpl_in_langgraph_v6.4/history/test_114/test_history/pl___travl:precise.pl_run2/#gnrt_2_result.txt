Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> block in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X).\n0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.6::inf_contact(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf_contact(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.2::inf_travel(X) :- riskyTravel(X).\n0.1::inf_initial(X) :- initialInf(X)."}
```

Note that both code blocks are derived from the same original <langda> block (hence the same HASH), but represent different implementations in the generated code - the first being the direct translation and the second being the separated predicates version.
