System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 1.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the most part. The test results indicate that all queries return the expected outcomes (1.0000), suggesting that the implemented predicates meet their specified requirements. However, there are minor stylistic and potential robustness issues that could be addressed to improve the code's clarity and maintainability.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No critical errors were identified in the code. The test results confirm that the predicates function as intended. However, the following observations highlight areas for improvement:
1. The `prove(implies(P,Q))` predicate could be more explicitly documented to clarify its logical equivalence to `P ⇒ Q`.
2. The `prove(opposite(P))` and `prove(refute(P))` predicates are functionally identical, which might lead to redundancy.
3. The `expand/2` rule is correctly implemented but lacks flexibility for more complex expansions.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "99C92279",
        "Report": "The `prove(implies(P,Q))` predicate correctly implements the logical implication `P ⇒ Q` by checking if `P` is unprovable or `Q` is provable. However, the predicate could benefit from a comment explaining its logical equivalence to `P ⇒ Q` for better readability."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "1405B337",
        "Report": "The `prove(opposite(P))` predicate correctly implements the negation of `P` by checking if `P` is unprovable. However, it is functionally identical to `prove(refute(P))`, which could lead to redundancy. Consider consolidating these predicates or documenting their intended use cases."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "C68F7B35",
        "Report": "The `prove(extend(List,Elem,Extended))` predicate correctly extends the list by adding `Elem` to its head. This implementation is straightforward and meets the requirements. No issues are identified."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "0F69CE0F",
        "Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` rule correctly defines `Y` as `X*2`. While this meets the requirement, the `expand/2` predicate could be generalized to handle more complex transformations if needed in the future."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Add comments to clarify the logical equivalence of `prove(implies(P,Q))` to `P ⇒ Q`.
2. Consolidate or document the use of `prove(opposite(P))` and `prove(refute(P))` to avoid redundancy.
3. Consider generalizing the `expand/2` predicate to handle more complex transformations if the use case expands.
4. Ensure all predicates are well-documented to improve code maintainability.
5. Review the test cases to ensure they cover edge cases, such as empty lists or invalid inputs, to further validate robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
