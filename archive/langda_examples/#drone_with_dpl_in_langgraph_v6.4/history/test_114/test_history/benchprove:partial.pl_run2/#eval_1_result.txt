Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in the original code:

```report
{"HASH": "99C92279","Report": "The `implies(P,Q)` predicate correctly implements logical implication (P â‡’ Q) by checking if P is unprovable or Q is provable. The test results confirm it works as expected. No regeneration is needed, but additional documentation could clarify its semantics for future maintainers.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "1405B337","Report": "The `opposite(P)` predicate correctly implements logical negation by checking if P is unprovable. This is a straightforward and correct implementation that passes all tests. No regeneration is required.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "C68F7B35","Report": "The `extend(List,Elem,Extended)` predicate correctly adds `Elem` to the head of `List`. While functionally correct, regeneration could be considered to handle edge cases (e.g., empty lists) or generalize for other list operations. However, since current requirements are fully met, regeneration isn't strictly necessary.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0F69CE0F","Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` predicate correctly implements `Y is X*2` for arithmetic operations. While limited in scope, it meets current requirements. Regeneration might be considered to add error handling for non-numeric inputs or expand functionality, but this isn't required by current tests.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

### Summary:
- No code blocks require regeneration as all meet their specified requirements and pass all tests.
- Minor improvements could be made (documentation, error handling, generalization), but these are enhancements rather than corrections.
- No dependencies between code blocks were identified that would require coordinated regeneration.
