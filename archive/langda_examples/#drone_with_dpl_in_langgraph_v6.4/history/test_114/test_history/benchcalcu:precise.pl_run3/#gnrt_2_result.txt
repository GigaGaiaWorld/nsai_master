Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This is the only code block that was modified in the generated code compared to the original code (where the `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` predicate was called twice). The generated code removed the redundant call while maintaining the same functionality.
