Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The only code block that was modified is the sumdigit call for the thousands digit calculation, which was simplified by removing the redundant call in the generated_code.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This corresponds to:
1. The hash tag from the <Langda> section (4623869C)
2. The completed code snippet that properly implements the thousands digit calculation (S + M + C3 = O with carry result M) without redundancy
