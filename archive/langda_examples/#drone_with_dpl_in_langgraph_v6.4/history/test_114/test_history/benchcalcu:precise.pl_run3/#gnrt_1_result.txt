Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code was about the sumdigit predicate for the thousands digit, and its hash was 4623869C. In the generated_code, this corresponds to a single line that was previously duplicated in the origin_code.

Here's the extracted code block in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

Note: This is the only code block that was modified between the origin_code and generated_code - the duplicate line was removed while keeping the functionality the same. The rest of the code remained unchanged.
