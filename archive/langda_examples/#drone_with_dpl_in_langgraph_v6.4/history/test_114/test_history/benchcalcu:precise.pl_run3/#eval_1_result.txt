Here is the structured evaluation for each code block:

```report
{"HASH": "B6FD3E20", "Report": "The code block ensures D and E are different digits, which is correct. The implementation meets the requirements, but the comment could be more explicit about the purpose (lowest digit uniqueness).", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "AFCFFD3D", "Report": "The `sumdigit` predicate correctly calculates the unit digit sum with carry. The logic is sound and matches the requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BA7F9BE8", "Report": "The assignment of N and uniqueness check are correct. The comment could clarify why N is assigned here (tens digit of SEND).", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["AFCFFD3D"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "3E567069", "Report": "The assignment of R and uniqueness check are correct. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["BA7F9BE8"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0BCA612F", "Report": "The `sumdigit` predicate for the tens digit is correct. The logic aligns with the requirements.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["3E567069"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "710BBD98", "Report": "The assignment of O and uniqueness check are correct. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["0BCA612F"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58F57C1C", "Report": "The `sumdigit` predicate for the hundreds digit is correct. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["710BBD98"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "70805326", "Report": "The assignment of S and uniqueness check are correct. The implementation meets the requirements (non-zero highest digit).", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["58F57C1C"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "72F32859", "Report": "The assignment of M and uniqueness check are correct. The implementation meets the requirements (non-zero highest digit).", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": ["70805326"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Report": "The `sumdigit` predicate for the thousands digit is correct but called redundantly. The duplicate call should be removed to avoid confusion.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["72F32859"]}
```

### Summary:
- Only the code block with hash `4623869C` needs regeneration due to redundant calls. 
- All other blocks are functionally correct but could benefit from improved comments (no regeneration needed). 
- Dependencies are noted where a block relies on the output of another block, but none of the dependencies require regeneration.
