Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- \n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, S),\n    ( S > 0, Winner = player1\n    ; S < 0, Winner = player2\n    ; S = 0, Winner = draw\n    )."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with `<langda>` in the original code, and it has been properly completed in the generated code. The JSON format includes the hash provided in the original code and the completed code snippet.
