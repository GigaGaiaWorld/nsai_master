Here are the structured reports for each code block:

```report
{
  "HASH": "3F277A35",
  "Report": "The `result(X, X, draw)` rule is syntactically correct but has an unnecessary period (`.`) after the closing parenthesis. This could cause parsing issues in some ProbLog environments. The rule itself correctly implements the requirement that same gestures result in a draw.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "FD850DEC",
  "Report": "The `compute_score([draw | Rs], S)` rule is duplicated in the code. While this does not affect functionality, it is redundant and should be removed to maintain clean code. The rule correctly implements the requirement that a draw does not affect the score.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "3FEB17D7",
  "Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate has a misplaced comma (`,`) after the `play/3` call, which could cause parsing errors. The logic of the predicate is correct, as it calculates the winner based on the score derived from the results of each round.",
  "Need_regenerate": true,
  "Dependencies": ["3F277A35", "FD850DEC"]
}
```

### Summary:
1. **HASH 3F277A35**: Does not need regeneration. Only a minor formatting issue exists, which doesn't affect functionality.
2. **HASH FD850DEC**: Does not need regeneration. The duplicate rule is redundant but doesn't impact functionality.
3. **HASH 3FEB17D7**: Needs regeneration due to a syntax error (misplaced comma). It depends on the other two code blocks, but they do not need regeneration.
