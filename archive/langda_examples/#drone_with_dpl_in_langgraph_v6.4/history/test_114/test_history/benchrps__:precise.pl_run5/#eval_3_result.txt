  "Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate is correctly implemented, calling `play/3` to generate results and `compute_score/2` to calculate the score. The logic for determining the winner based on the score is sound and matches the requirements. The test result confirms it works as expected. However, the predicate is redundantly defined earlier in the code (without a HASH), which should be removed to avoid confusion. This block itself does not need regeneration, but the redundant definition elsewhere should be cleaned up.",

  "Report": "The initial `result/3` definition has issues: (1) a redundant duplicate clause (`result(X, X, draw)`), and (2) a misplaced line break in the first clause. The incomplete `determine_winner/3` definition is redundant and should be removed. These issues are syntactic and logical but do not affect the final implementation (HASH 3FEB17D7). Since these are fragments without a HASH, they should be cleaned up manually rather than regenerated.",
