Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "06576BEB", "Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :-\n    digit(H, D),\n    number(T, N1),\n    N is N1 * 10 + D."}
```

Note that this is the only code block that was marked with <langda> in the origin_code. The other parts of the generated code were either already complete in the origin_code or weren't marked as needing completion.
