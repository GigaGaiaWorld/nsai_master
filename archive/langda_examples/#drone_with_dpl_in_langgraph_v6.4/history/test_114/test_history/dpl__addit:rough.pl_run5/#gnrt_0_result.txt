Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> placeholder:

```problog
{"HASH": "06576BEB", "Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :-\n    digit(H, D),\n    number(T, N1),\n    N is N1 * 10 + D."}
```

This is the only code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code, which requested the definition of the `number` predicate to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values.
