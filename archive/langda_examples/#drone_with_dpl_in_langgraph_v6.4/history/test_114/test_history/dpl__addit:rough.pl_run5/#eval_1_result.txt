  "Report": "The code block implements the `number` predicate correctly for valid inputs, converting a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. However, it lacks proper error handling for invalid image IDs and could benefit from being enclosed in a ProbLog program block for better integration. The test results show it works as expected for valid inputs, so regeneration isn't strictly necessary but would be recommended for robustness.",

However, it lacks input validation and error handling for invalid inputs. While it doesn't need regeneration for basic functionality, enhancing it with validation would improve robustness.",
