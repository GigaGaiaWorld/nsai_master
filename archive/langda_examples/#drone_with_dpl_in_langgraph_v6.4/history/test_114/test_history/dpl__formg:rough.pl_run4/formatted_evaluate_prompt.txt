System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code_Block>% Merge Sort in Problog

% Base case: empty list or single element list is already sorted
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).

% Recursive case: split the list into two halves, sort each, and merge the results
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    Half is Len // 2,
    split(List, Half, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

% Split a list into two halves
split(List, Half, Left, Right) :-
    length(Left, Half),
    append(Left, Right, List).

% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X|Left], [Y|Right], [X|Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Left, [Y|Right], Merged).
merge([X|Left], [Y|Right], [Y|Merged]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X|Left], Right, Merged).</Code_Block>

<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable merge_sort/2 algorithm </Requirements></Langda>
.
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test result confirms that it correctly sorts the input list [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12] into [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct, fulfilling the specified requirements. However, there are minor stylistic and potential efficiency issues that could be addressed." </Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> "No critical errors were identified in the code. The test result confirms the correctness of the implementation. However, the `append/3` predicate is redundantly defined outside the main code block, which could lead to confusion or conflicts if other parts of the program also define `append/3`." </Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "418D2062",
        "Report": "The merge sort implementation is correct and adheres to the requirements. The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` are well-defined and work as expected. The test result validates the correctness of the implementation. However, the `split/4` predicate could be optimized by avoiding the use of `length/2` and `append/3` for splitting the list, as this approach is less efficient for large lists."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The redundant definition of `append/3` outside the main code block is unnecessary and could cause issues in larger programs. It should either be removed or integrated into the main code block if needed."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>"1. Remove the redundant `append/3` definition to avoid potential conflicts. 2. Optimize the `split/4` predicate by using a more efficient method for splitting lists, such as direct traversal. 3. Consider adding additional test cases to further validate the robustness of the implementation, including edge cases like empty lists or lists with duplicate elements." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
