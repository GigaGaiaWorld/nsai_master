  "Report": "The merge_sort predicate and its helper predicates (split and merge) are syntactically correct, but the merge logic is flawed. The merge predicate fails to correctly compare and merge the elements of the two sorted lists. Specifically, the conditions for merging ([X|Left] and [Y|Right]) are not correctly implemented, leading to an incorrect sorted list. The test result confirms this issue, as the output is not properly sorted. The split predicate appears to function correctly, but the merge logic needs regeneration to ensure proper sorting.",
