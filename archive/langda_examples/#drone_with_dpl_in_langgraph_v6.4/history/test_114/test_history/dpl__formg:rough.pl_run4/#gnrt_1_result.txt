Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "418D2062", "Code": "% Merge Sort in Problog\n\n% Base case: empty list or single element list is already sorted\nmerge_sort([], []).\nmerge_sort([X], [X]).\n\n% Recursive case: split the list into two halves, sort each, and merge the results\nmerge_sort(List, Sorted) :-\n    length(List, Len),\n    Len > 1,\n    Half is Len // 2,\n    split(List, Half, Left, Right),\n    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),\n    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),\n    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).\n\n% Split a list into two halves\nsplit(List, Half, Left, Right) :-\n    length(Left, Half),\n    append(Left, Right, List).\n\n% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list\nmerge([], Right, Right).\nmerge(Left, [], Left).\nmerge([X|Left], [Y|Right], [X|Merged]) :-\n    X =< Y,\n    merge(Left, [Y|Right], Merged).\nmerge([X|Left], [Y|Right], [Y|Merged]) :-\n    X > Y,\n    merge([X|Left], Right, Merged)."}
```

Note: I noticed there's a typo in the generated code (`merge_sort(Right, SortedRight)` was written as `merge_sort(Right, SortedRight)` in the original, but appears correctly in the generated code). I've preserved the exact generated code in the output.
