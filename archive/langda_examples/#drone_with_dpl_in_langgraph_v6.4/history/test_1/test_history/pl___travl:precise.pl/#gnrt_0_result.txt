Here's the complete DeepProbLog code in JSON form based on the requirements:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "E09B4F54",
    "Code": "person(a).\nperson(b).\n0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).\n\n% Contact transmission rules\n0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+ susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n\n% Additional infection sources\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X).\n\n% Initial infection can cause infection\ninf(X) :- initialInf(X).\n\n% Background probabilities\n0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).\n0.1::riskyTravel(X) :- person(X).\n0.1::susceptible(X) :- person(X).\n\nquery(inf(_))."
}
```

This code implements all the requirements:
1. Initial infection probability of 0.1 for each person
2. Contact transmission with different probabilities based on susceptibility
   - 0.6 if not susceptible
   - 0.8 if susceptible
3. Additional 0.2 infection probability from risky travel
4. All the background probabilities (contact, riskyTravel, susceptible) remain at 0.1 as in the original
5. The query remains the same to check infection probabilities

The code maintains all the original predicates while adding the new infection logic as specified in the requirements.
