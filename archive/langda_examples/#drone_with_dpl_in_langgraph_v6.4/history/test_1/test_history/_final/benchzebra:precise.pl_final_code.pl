The generated code has several issues. First, it contains duplicate clauses for 'zebra(Houses)' and 'houses' definitions, which is syntactically incorrect. Second, the attribute order in the house predicates is inconsistent with the original code, leading to logical errors. Third, there's a syntax error with an extra '.' after 'query(zebra(Houses))'. These issues make the generated code invalid and unable to run correctly. The original code runs successfully and produces a valid solution to the zebra puzzle, while the generated code fails to parse due to syntax errors.
