<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
