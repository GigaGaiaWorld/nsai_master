Here's the complete code in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "CFA63C1E",
    "Code": "% Three gestures\nmove(rock).\nmove(paper).\nmove(scissor).\n% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y\nbeats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(scissor, paper).\nbeats(paper, rock).\n\n% Play a single round\nplay_round(P1, P2, Result) :-\n    (beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win\n    ; beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose\n    ; Result = draw).\n\n% Play multiple rounds\nplay([], [], []).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [R|Rs]) :-\n    play_round(P1, P2, R),\n    play(P1s, P2s, Rs)."
}
```

```problog
{
    "HASH": "",
    "Code": "compute_score([], 0).\ncompute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.\ncompute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.\ncompute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.\n\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- \n    play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), \n    compute_score(Results,S), \n    ( S > 0, Winner = player1 \n    ; S < 0, Winner = player2 \n    ; S = 0, Winner = draw \n    ).\n\nquery(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W))."
}
```

Note that I've:
1. Organized the code into two logical blocks (game rules and scoring)
2. Added the missing `play_round` predicate that was implied but not defined
3. Kept the original hash for the first block
4. Left the second block's hash empty as it wasn't provided
5. Maintained all the original functionality while making the code more complete
