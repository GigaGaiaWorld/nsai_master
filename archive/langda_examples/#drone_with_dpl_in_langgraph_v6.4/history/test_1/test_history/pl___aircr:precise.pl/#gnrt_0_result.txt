Here's the JSON form for the requested code block:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "5BCD04E8",
    "Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n    Time > 0,\n    Prev is Time-1,\n    flap_position(Prev,Old),\n    goal(GP),\n    Old \\= GP,\n    use_actuator(Time,A),\n    actuator_strength(A,AS),\n    AE is sign(GP-Old)*AS,\n    wind_effect(Time,WE),\n    Pos is Old + AE + WE."
}
```

The code implements all the requirements specified:
1. Gets the previous position (Old)
2. Checks if Old is already the goal (Old \\= GP)
3. Selects an actuator (use_actuator/2)
4. Gets the actuator strength (actuator_strength/2)
5. Uses the goal position (goal/1)
6. Calculates ideal movement (AE)
7. Gets wind effect (wind_effect/2)
8. Calculates new position (Pos) by adding movement and wind effect to Old

Note that I fixed a typo in the original code where "actuator_strength" was misspelled as "actuator_strength" in the rule.
