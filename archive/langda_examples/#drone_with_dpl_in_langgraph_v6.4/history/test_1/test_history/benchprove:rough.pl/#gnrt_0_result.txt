Here's the generated code in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "E553CC07",
    "Code": "% --------- Extended logic processing ---------\n% implies/2: Prove that A implies B\nprove(implies(A,B)) :-\n    (prove(A) -> prove(B); true).\n\n% opposite/1: Prove that something is not provable\nprove(opposite(A)) :-\n    \\+ prove(A).\n\n% expand/2: Expand a term according to defined rules\nprove(expand(A,B)) :-\n    expand(A,B).\n\n% includes/2: Check if element is in list\nprove(includes(List,Element)) :-\n    member(Element,List).\n\n% extend/2: Extend a list with an element\nprove(extend(List,Element,Extended)) :-\n    Extended = [Element|List].\n\n% refute/1: Attempt to prove the opposite\nprove(refute(A)) :-\n    (prove(A) -> false; true)."
}
```

For the second code block (which appears to be examples and queries), since no HASH was provided in the requirements, I'll omit it as per your instructions. The first code block with HASH E553CC07 contains all the requested extended logic processing rules for prove/1:

1. implies/2 - proves implication (if A then B)
2. opposite/1 - proves the negation of a goal
3. expand/2 - handles term expansion
4. includes/2 - checks list membership
5. extend/2 - handles list extension
6. refute/1 - attempts to disprove a goal

The implementation follows standard Prolog idioms while maintaining compatibility with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework.
