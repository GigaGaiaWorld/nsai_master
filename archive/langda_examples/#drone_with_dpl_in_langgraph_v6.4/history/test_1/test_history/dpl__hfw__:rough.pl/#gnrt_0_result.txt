This code implements the recursive expression evaluator `parse/2` that can handle all four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The parser works by:
1. Finding an operator in the list
2. Recursively parsing the left and right parts of the expression
3. Applying the appropriate operation based on the operator found

The parser handles operator precedence correctly by processing the expression left-to-right, which is the standard behavior for Prolog arithmetic evaluation. The base case is when there's just a single number left in the list.
