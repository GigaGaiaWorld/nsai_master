% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).

<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Same gestures are considered a draw </LLM></Langda>
.
result(X, Y, win) :-
<Langda> Information of 2nd Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: D91BB7A0 </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: If X beats Y, then X wins </LLM></Langda>
.
result(X, Y, lose) :-

<LLM> Requirements of Rules: % If Y beats X, then X loses </LLM></Langda>

% End of recursion: empty list corresponds to empty result
play([], [], []).
% Recursive advancement: take out each round of gestures, calculate the results, and continue
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
% The correct call is result(P1,P2,R), not semicolon
result(P1, P2, R),
% (Optional) Update the score according to R
play(P1T, P2T, Rs).

<Langda> Information of 4th Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 583E41B6 </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: If the result of the current round is win: Recursively calculate the score S1 of the remaining results Rs The current total score S is S1 + 1, that is, add one point to player1 </LLM></Langda>
.
<Langda> Information of 5th Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: D324979D </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: If the result of the current round is lose: Recursively calculate the remaining result score S1 The current total score S is S1 - 1, which means adding one point to player2 </LLM></Langda>
.
<Langda> Information of 6th Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: FD850DEC </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: If the current round is draw: A draw does not affect the score, and the previous round score S1 is directly passed. </LLM></Langda>

<Langda> Information of 7th Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 3FEB17D7 </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Main predicate: Given two player action lists P1Moves and P2Moves, calculate the winner Winner. Call the play/3 rule to compare the two players' actions and generate a Results list containing whether each round is win, lose, or draw. </LLM></Langda>

<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
