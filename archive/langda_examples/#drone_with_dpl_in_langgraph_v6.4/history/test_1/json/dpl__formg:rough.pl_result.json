  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm and produces the same result as the original code. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'split' function, which is more concise in the generated code compared to the original 'split_list' function. The generated code maintains the same logic and structure as the original, ensuring consistency in functionality. There are no apparent problems in the generated code."
