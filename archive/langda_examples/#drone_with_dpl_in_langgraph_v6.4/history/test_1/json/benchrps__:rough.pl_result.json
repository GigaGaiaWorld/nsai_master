  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the functionality of the original code but introduces errors. The main issue is the incorrect use of the '->' operator in the 'play_round' predicate, which causes a runtime error. The original code correctly uses separate clauses for each result case, while the generated code tries to use conditional statements improperly. The generated code also redundantly repeats the move and beats declarations. The functionality is conceptually similar but implemented incorrectly."
