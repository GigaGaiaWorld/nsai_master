  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, there are duplicate predicate definitions for 'game' which causes a syntax error. Second, the implementation of the 'game' predicate is incorrect, particularly in the third clause where it incorrectly adds a HouseCard to the list of cards. The original code correctly handles the house rank and card distribution. The generated code fails to compile due to syntax errors and logical inconsistencies, making it invalid. The original code produces correct probabilistic outcomes, while the generated code fails to run at all."
