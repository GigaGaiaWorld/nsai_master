  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it contains duplicate definitions of the 'insertion_sort' and 'insert_element' predicates, which is redundant and can lead to confusion. Second, the generated code has a syntax error with an extra dot after the query statement. Third, the running result shows an error due to invalid argument types in the '=</2' call, indicating that the generated code is not properly handling the sorting logic. The original code, on the other hand, is clean and correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm."
