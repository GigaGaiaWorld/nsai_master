  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and structure. Both codes aim to find countries with approximately equal population density. The generated code maintains the same predicates and calculations as the original. However, there are minor formatting differences, such as the placement of periods in some pop/2 facts. These differences do not affect the functionality or the results."
