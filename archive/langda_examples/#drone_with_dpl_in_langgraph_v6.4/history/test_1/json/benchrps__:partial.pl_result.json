  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. However, there are some formatting issues, such as unnecessary line breaks and periods. The most significant problem is in the 'compute_score' predicate where the last clause incorrectly omits 'S1' in the arithmetic operation, which could lead to incorrect score calculations. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output for the given query."
