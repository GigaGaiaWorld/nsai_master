  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm in DeepProbLog but contains several issues. It introduces a cut operator (!) which is not properly handled, leading to an 'UnknownClause' error. The logic for bubble_pass is different from the original's hole and bubble predicates, and it uses a 'Changed' flag which isn't present in the original. The generated code is not consistent with the original implementation and fails to execute due to syntax errors."
