  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, there are duplicate declarations of 'person(a).', 'person(b).', and 'initialInf(X) :- person(X).', which are redundant and unnecessary. Second, the 'contact(X,Y)', 'riskyTravel(X)', and 'susceptible(X)' rules are declared twice, which could lead to incorrect probability calculations. The generated code also has a syntax error with an extra '.' after 'query(inf(_))' and a duplicate 'query(inf(_))' line. These issues make the generated code inconsistent with the original code and affect the correctness of the results."
