  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but contains some formatting issues and a duplicate line for world probabilities. The duplicate line does not affect the logic but is redundant. The main issue is that the running results differ significantly from the original, particularly for the 'attack' and 'abandon' queries, indicating a potential error in the generated code's logic or execution."
