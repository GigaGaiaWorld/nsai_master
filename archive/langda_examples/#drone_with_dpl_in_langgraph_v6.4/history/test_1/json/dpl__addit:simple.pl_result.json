  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it redundantly repeats the 'digit' facts and the 'addition' rule, which is unnecessary and makes the code less clean. Second, there is a syntax error with a misplaced period before the second 'query' statement. Despite these issues, the core logic of the 'addition' rule is correct and matches the original code. The running results are consistent with the original code, showing the correct addition of 5 and 6 as 11, but the redundant query and syntax error affect the form validity."
