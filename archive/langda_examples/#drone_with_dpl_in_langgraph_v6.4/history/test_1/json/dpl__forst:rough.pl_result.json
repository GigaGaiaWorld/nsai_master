  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, but there is a discrepancy in the 'rot' operation. The original code rotates the top three elements as [Z,X,Y|Stack], while the generated code rotates them as [Y,Z,X|Stack]. This leads to different results for the 'rot' operation. The generated code also includes a redundant duplication of the 'stack_op(sort)' and 'get_top_n' predicates, which does not affect functionality but is unnecessary. The insertion_sort implementation is correctly added and works as expected."
