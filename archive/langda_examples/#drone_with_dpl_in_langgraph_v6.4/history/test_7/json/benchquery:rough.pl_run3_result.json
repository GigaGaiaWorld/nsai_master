  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid as it contains a syntax error in the clause head '(Country, Density)', which is not a valid Prolog or ProbLog syntax. The original code correctly defines a predicate 'density' with two arguments, while the generated code attempts to define a predicate with a tuple-like structure that is not supported. This results in a grounding error during execution. The generated code fails to meet the requirements and does not produce consistent results with the original code."
