  "final_report": "The generated code is missing some constraints present in the original code, such as the 'right_of' and 'my_member' clauses for green and ivory houses, and the clause involving coffee. This omission leads to an incomplete solution, causing the code to time out during execution instead of producing a valid result. The generated code is not consistent with the original code and fails to meet the requirements."
