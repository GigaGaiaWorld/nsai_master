  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet expectations. It introduces errors in the 'game' predicate definitions, particularly in the second clause where it references 'OwnCards' and 'OpponentCards' which are not properly defined or passed. This leads to a timeout error during execution, indicating the code is not valid. The original code runs successfully and produces expected probabilistic outcomes, while the generated code fails to execute properly."
