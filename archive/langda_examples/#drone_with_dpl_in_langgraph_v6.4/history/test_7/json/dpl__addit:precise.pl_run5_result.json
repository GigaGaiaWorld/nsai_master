  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to extend the original code's functionality by handling multi-digit addition, but it contains errors. The main issue is the use of an undefined 'length' function in Problog. The original code correctly performs single-digit addition, while the generated code fails to execute due to syntax errors. The concept of multi-digit addition is a valid extension, but the implementation is incorrect."
