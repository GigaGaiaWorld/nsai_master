  "final_report": "The generated code is nearly identical to the original code, maintaining all the rules, facts, and queries. The only difference is the formatting of the 'abandon' predicate, which is split into multiple lines in the generated code but remains functionally equivalent. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements. The running results of both pieces of code are consistent, producing the same probabilities for the queries."
