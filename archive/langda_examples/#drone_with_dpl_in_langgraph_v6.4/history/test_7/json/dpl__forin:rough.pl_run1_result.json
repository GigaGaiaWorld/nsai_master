  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement insertion sort in Prolog and produce the same sorted result for the given query. The generated code improves readability by renaming 'insert_element' to 'insert' and adding comments for clarity. The logic and structure remain unchanged, ensuring the same output."
