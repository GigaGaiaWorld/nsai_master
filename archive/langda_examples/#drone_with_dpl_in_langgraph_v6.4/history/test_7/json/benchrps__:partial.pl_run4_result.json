  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with a few minor issues. First, there is a typo in 'scissors' (should be 'scissor' to match the original). Second, the compute_score rule for 'draw' is incorrect (missing 'S is S1'). Despite these issues, the logic remains intact and produces the same result as the original code."
