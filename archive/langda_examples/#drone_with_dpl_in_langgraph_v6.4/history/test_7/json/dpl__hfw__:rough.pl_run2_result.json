  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the parsing logic by introducing an arithmetic_operation predicate, which is a valid approach. However, it fails to correctly handle the subtraction operation as in the original code (which treated subtraction as adding a negative product). This leads to different results for the same query. The generated code's result (11.666...) is incorrect compared to the original code's result (-10.333...). The form is valid but the logic differs."
