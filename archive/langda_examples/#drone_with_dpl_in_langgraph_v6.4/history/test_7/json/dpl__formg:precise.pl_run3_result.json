  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same correct sorting result. The main differences are in formatting (line breaks and spacing) and the merging of the split_list predicate into the merge_sort predicate. While the form differs slightly, the logic remains identical. Both codes correctly implement merge sort and produce the expected output."
