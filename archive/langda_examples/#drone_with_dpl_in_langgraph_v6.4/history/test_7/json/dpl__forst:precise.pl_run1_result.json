  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sort operation. The main improvement in the generated code is the addition of a check for stack length before sorting, which prevents errors when the stack has fewer than 3 elements. However, the generated code lacks the insertion_sort predicate, which was present in the original code but not shown in the results. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same outputs for the given queries."
