  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same correct sorting result. The logic for insertion sort is preserved, with identical predicate definitions and behavior. The only differences are minor formatting changes (extra whitespace and line breaks), which do not affect the code's functionality. Both codes correctly sort the list [3,1,2,5,7,12] into [1,2,3,5,7,12] with a probability of 1.0000."
