  "final_report": "The generated code implements a bubble sort algorithm similar to the original code but with a different approach. The original code uses a 'hole' predicate to handle swapping, while the generated code uses 'bubble_pass' with explicit comparisons. Both codes produce the same correct sorted result for the given input. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, though its structure differs from the original. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same sorted list."
