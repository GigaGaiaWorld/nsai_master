  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The main issue lies in the implementation of the 'implies' predicate, which in the original code checks if P is unprovable or Q is provable, while the generated code incorrectly requires both A and B to be provable. Additionally, the generated code lacks implementations for 'opposite', 'includes', and 'extend' predicates, leading to incorrect results. The running results of the generated code are inconsistent with the original code, showing 0.0000 for queries that should return 1.0000."
