  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The only difference is in the implementation of the 'team_strength' predicate, where the generated code splits the calculation into two separate calls for clarity, but this does not affect the overall behavior or results. Both codes produce identical run results, indicating that the generated code meets the expectations."
