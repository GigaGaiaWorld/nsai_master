  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and does not meet the expectations. It only includes one constraint (the English person in the red house) from the original code, missing all other important constraints that define the zebra puzzle. The form is technically valid Prolog syntax, but it's not a complete solution to the problem. The results show multiple possible configurations with many unbound variables, demonstrating that the generated code fails to properly constrain the solution space like the original code does."
