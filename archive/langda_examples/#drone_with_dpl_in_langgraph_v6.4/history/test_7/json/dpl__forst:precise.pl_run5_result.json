  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and introduces a conditional check in the 'sort' operation to handle cases where the stack has fewer than 3 elements. The generated code uses the built-in 'sort' predicate instead of 'insertion_sort', which is a valid simplification. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming functional consistency."
