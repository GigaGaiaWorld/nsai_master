  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one notable exception in the 'rot' operation. In the original code, 'rot' transforms [X,Y,Z|Stack] into [Z,X,Y|Stack], while the generated code transforms it into [Z,Y,X|Stack]. This difference leads to inconsistent results for the 'rot' operation. All other operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over) and the sorting functionality remain correct and consistent with the original code."
