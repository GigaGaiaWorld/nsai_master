  "final_report": "The generated code introduces a different parsing approach using separate predicates for addition/subtraction and multiplication/division, which is structurally different from the original code. However, it fails to produce the correct result for the given query, returning a probability of 0.0000 instead of the expected -10.333333333333332. The generated code's parsing logic appears incomplete as it doesn't properly handle the operator precedence and expression evaluation as the original code does."
