  "final_report": "The generated code is nearly identical to the original code, maintaining all the same rules, facts, and queries. The only difference is a minor formatting change in the 'abandon' predicate definition, which does not affect the logic or functionality. The generated code correctly implements the probabilistic model described in the original example and produces the same query results."
