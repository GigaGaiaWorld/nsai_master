  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement insertion sort in Prolog with identical logic. The generated code renames 'insert_element' to 'insert', which is a minor syntactic change but does not affect the behavior. The query and results are the same for both codes, producing the correct sorted list."
