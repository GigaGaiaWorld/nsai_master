  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The main issue lies in the implementation of the 'implies' predicate, which in the original code succeeds if either P is unprovable or Q is provable, whereas in the generated code it requires both A and B to be provable. Additionally, the generated code lacks implementations for 'opposite', 'includes', and 'extend' predicates, leading to incorrect results. The generated code is valid in form but fails to produce consistent results with the original code."
