  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and implements a bubblesort algorithm, though it uses a different approach than the original code. The original code uses a 'hole' predicate to handle swaps, while the generated code uses a 'bubble_pass' predicate with a flag to track swaps. Both codes produce the same correct sorted result. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, and its running result is consistent with the original code."
