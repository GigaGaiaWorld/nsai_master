  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle lists of images representing multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The code is logically consistent with the original but operates on a more complex input structure. The generated code is valid and correctly implements the intended functionality, as evidenced by the correct result (79 + 231 = 310)."
