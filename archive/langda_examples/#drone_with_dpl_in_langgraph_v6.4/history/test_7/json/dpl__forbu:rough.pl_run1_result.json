  "final_report": "The generated code implements a bubble sort algorithm similar to the original code but with a different structure. It uses a 'bubble_pass' predicate to perform each pass of the bubble sort and tracks whether any swaps occurred. The generated code is valid and correctly sorts the list, producing the same result as the original code. The main difference is the approach to tracking swaps and the use of an accumulator in the sorting process. Both codes are consistent in functionality and output."
