  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but introduces modifications in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate. It adds checks for intermediate positions and ensures the final position is within bounds using min/max and rounding. These changes affect the probabilities, particularly eliminating overrun exceptions entirely, which differs from the original's behavior where overruns were possible. The goal-reaching probabilities are slightly altered but follow a similar trend."
