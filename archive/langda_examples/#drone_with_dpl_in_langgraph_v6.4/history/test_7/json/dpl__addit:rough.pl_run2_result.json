  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of digit images into their corresponding numerical values and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly processes lists of digits and performs the addition as expected. The running results are consistent with the original code's logic, demonstrating correct arithmetic operations. The generated code is more versatile than the original, handling multi-digit numbers instead of single digits."
