  "final_report": "The generated code extends the functionality of the original code by introducing a 'number' predicate that can handle lists of images to form multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these multi-digit numbers. This is a valid and logical extension of the original concept. The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements. The running results of both pieces of code are consistent with their respective functionalities: the original performs single-digit addition while the generated code handles multi-digit addition."
