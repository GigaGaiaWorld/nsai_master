This omission causes the program to fail with an 'UnknownClause' error. The original code includes all necessary predicates (move/1, beats/2, result/3, play/3, compute_score/2, and determine_winner/3) and runs successfully. The generated code also redundantly repeats some predicate definitions (move/1 and beats/2) without adding any value."
