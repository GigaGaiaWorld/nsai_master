  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with the exception of the 'rot' operation. In the original code, 'rot' rotates the top three elements as [X,Y,Z] to [Z,X,Y], while the generated code rotates them to [Z,Y,X]. This is a significant difference in behavior. All other operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over) are correctly implemented and produce the same results as the original code. The sorting operation and helper predicates are also correctly replicated."
