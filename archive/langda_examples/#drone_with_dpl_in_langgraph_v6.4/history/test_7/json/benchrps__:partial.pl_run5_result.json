  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues. First, there is a typo in the move 'scissors' (spelled as 'scissor' in the original). Second, the 'compute_score' rule for 'draw' is incorrect as it does not calculate the score properly. Despite these issues, the running results are consistent with the original code."
