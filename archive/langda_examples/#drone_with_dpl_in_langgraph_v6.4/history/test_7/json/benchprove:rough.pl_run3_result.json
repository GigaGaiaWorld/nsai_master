  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. However, there is a significant difference in the implementation of 'implies/2'. The original code correctly implements P ⇒ Q as 'P is unprovable or Q is provable', while the generated code incorrectly implements it as 'prove A and prove B', which changes the logical meaning. Despite this, the running results are consistent for the given queries because the specific queries happen to work with both implementations in this case."
