  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubblesort algorithm but contains several issues. It introduces new predicates like bubble_pass and uses a conditional operator (->) which is not present in the original code. The main error occurs due to an incorrect use of the conditional operator, leading to a runtime error ('UnknownClause'). The generated code is not consistent with the original implementation and fails to execute properly."
