  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally consistent with the original code, maintaining the same rules and probabilities. However, the running results differ significantly (0.1245 vs 0.0316). This discrepancy suggests a potential issue in the interpretation or execution environment, as the code logic appears identical. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results."
