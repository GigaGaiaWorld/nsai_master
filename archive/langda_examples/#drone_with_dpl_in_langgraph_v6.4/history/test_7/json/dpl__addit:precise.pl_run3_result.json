  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to extend the original code's functionality by adding multi-digit addition. However, it contains errors in the implementation. The main issue is the use of an undefined 'length' function in Problog, which causes the code to fail during execution. While the intention to handle multi-digit numbers is a logical extension of the original single-digit addition, the implementation is not valid in Problog syntax."
