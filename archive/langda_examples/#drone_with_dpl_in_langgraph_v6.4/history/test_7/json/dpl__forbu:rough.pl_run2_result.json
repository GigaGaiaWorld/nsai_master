  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm but contains several issues. Unlike the original code which correctly sorts the list, the generated code fails to produce the correct sorted list. The main problems are: 1) The bubble_pass predicate incorrectly handles the accumulation of sorted elements, 2) The Flag mechanism doesn't properly control the sorting process, and 3) The append operations are incorrectly used, leading to malformed lists. The generated code's result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating it failed to produce any valid solution."
