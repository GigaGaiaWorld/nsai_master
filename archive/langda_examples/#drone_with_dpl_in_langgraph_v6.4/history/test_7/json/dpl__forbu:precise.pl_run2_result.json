  "final_report": "The generated code introduces probabilistic elements to the swap operation, which differs from the deterministic behavior of the original code. While the generated code is syntactically valid and runs without errors, it produces multiple possible outcomes with associated probabilities, unlike the original code which produces a single deterministic result. This change in behavior means the generated code does not fully replicate the functionality of the original code."
