  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally consistent with the original code, maintaining the same rules and probabilities. However, the running results differ significantly (0.1245 vs 0.0316). This discrepancy suggests that either the underlying inference engine or the interpretation of the rules has changed. The generated code itself is valid and meets the requirements, but the results are not consistent with the original."
