  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it misses the essential 'play/3' and 'result/3' predicates that are present in the original code. This omission leads to a runtime error when trying to execute the 'play/3' predicate. Additionally, the 'compute_score/2' predicate is duplicated in the generated code, which is redundant but not harmful. The generated code fails to produce the same result as the original due to these structural deficiencies."
