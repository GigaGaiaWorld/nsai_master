  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and includes the sort operation with a conditional check for get_top_n. The main difference is the replacement of insertion_sort with the built-in sort predicate, which is more efficient but functionally equivalent for this context. The generated code also adds a fallback case when get_top_n fails, which improves robustness. Both codes produce identical results for the given queries."
