  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement insertion sort in Prolog with identical logic. The only difference is the renaming of the predicate 'insert_element' to 'insert' in the generated code, which does not affect the behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list with a probability of 1.0000."
