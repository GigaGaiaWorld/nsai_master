    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog. It handles both base and recursive cases properly, and the insert/3 predicate correctly places elements in sorted order. The test case provided confirms the implementation works as expected, producing the correct sorted output [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] for the input [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12].
