Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<Langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "3A3D0149", "Code": "density(C,D) :-\n    pop(C, P),\n    area(C, A),\n    D is (P * 100) // A. % Using floor division for integer density"}
```

This matches:
1. The original hash tag from the `<Langda>` block
2. The corrected implementation using floor division (`//`) as required
3. The proper predicate structure integrating with `pop/2` and `area/2`
4. The correct termination with a period
