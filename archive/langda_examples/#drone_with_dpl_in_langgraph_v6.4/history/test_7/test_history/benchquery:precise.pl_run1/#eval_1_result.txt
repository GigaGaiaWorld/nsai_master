{"HASH": "A37F4273","Report": "The query_pop/4 predicate correctly implements the logic to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population density. The inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1` are a clever way to avoid division and decimals, but they may not always be precise due to integer division. The condition `C1 @< C2` ensures unique pairs, which is good. However, the precision could be improved by using floating-point division and direct ratio comparison.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["3A3D0149"]}

{"HASH": "3A3D0149","Report": "The density/2 predicate calculates population density using floor division (`//`), which may lead to loss of precision. For example, a population of 8250 (china) and an area of 3380 would yield a density of 244 (8250 * 100 // 3380 = 244.08 truncated to 244). This truncation could affect the inequality checks in query_pop/4. It is recommended to use floating-point division (`/`) for more precise density values.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
