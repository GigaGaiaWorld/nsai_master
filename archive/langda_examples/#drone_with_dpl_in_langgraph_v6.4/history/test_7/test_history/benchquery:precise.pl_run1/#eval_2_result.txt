  "Report": "The `density/2` predicate currently uses floating-point division (`/`) for calculating population density, which contradicts the requirement to use floor division (`//`). This logical inconsistency needs to be corrected. Additionally, the test error suggests potential formatting issues (missing terminator or misplaced character) in this block. The block should be regenerated to: 1) Use floor division as required (`D is (P * 100) // A`), 2) Ensure proper termination (check for missing period), and 3) Maintain integration with the rest of the query logic.",
