Here is the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<Langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "3A3D0149", "Code": "density(C,D) :-\n    pop(C, P),\n    area(C, A),\n    D is (P * 100) / A. % Using floating-point division for precision"}
```

Note: The generated code changed the floor division (`//`) to floating-point division (`/`) as suggested in the `<Report>` section of the `<Langda>` block, while maintaining the same hash value from the original requirements.
