  "Report": "The `density` predicate is syntactically incorrect. The clause head should be `density(Country, Density)` instead of `Country, Density`. Additionally, the predicate does not include logic to compare densities for countries within a 5% range, as required. The current implementation only calculates the density but does not fulfill the requirement of finding countries with approximately equal densities.",
