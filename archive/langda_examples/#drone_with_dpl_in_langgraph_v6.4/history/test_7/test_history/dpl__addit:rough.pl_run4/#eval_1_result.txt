It successfully converts a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values by recursively processing the list, multiplying the accumulated result by 10, and adding the current digit.

  "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate contains a logical error. While it correctly uses the `number` predicate to convert lists of image IDs to integers, the final addition operation is incorrect. The test result shows `310` instead of the expected `391` (79 + 312). This indicates a flaw in how the results from `number` are combined. The predicate needs to be revised to correctly sum the two numbers.",
