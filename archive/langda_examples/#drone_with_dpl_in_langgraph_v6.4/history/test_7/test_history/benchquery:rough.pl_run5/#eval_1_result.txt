  "Report": "The `density` predicate is correctly implemented to calculate population density using the `pop` and `area` facts. However, it is not utilized in any query or further logic to meet the requirements. The predicate itself is syntactically and logically correct, but the overall functionality is incomplete due to the missing `query_pop` predicate.",
