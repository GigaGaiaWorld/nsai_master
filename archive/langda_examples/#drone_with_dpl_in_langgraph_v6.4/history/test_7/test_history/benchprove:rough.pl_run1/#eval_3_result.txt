  "Report": "The extended logic processing block correctly implements all required predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, `refute/1`) and passes all tests. However, there are minor issues: 1) `expand/2` is limited to predefined arithmetic operations, 2) `extend/2` lacks input validation, and 3) `refute/1` is redundant with `opposite/1`. These issues do not affect current functionality but could be improved for robustness and clarity.",
