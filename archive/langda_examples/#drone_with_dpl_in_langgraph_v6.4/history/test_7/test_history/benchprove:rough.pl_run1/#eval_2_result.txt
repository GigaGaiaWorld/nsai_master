  "Report": "The extended logic processing block (`prove/1` extensions) is mostly correct but fails due to the undefined `append/3` predicate. The predicates `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, and `refute/1` are correctly implemented and align with the requirements. However, `extend/3` relies on `append/3`, which is not available in the current scope. The block needs regeneration to either include a definition of `append/3` or replace the implementation of `extend/3` with a custom list concatenation logic that doesn't depend on `append/3`.",
