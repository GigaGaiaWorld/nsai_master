{"HASH": "E553CC07","Report": "The `implies/2` predicate is correctly implemented and works as expected, as shown by the successful test result for `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))`. However, the code block is incomplete as it does not include the other required predicates (`opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, `refute/1`). This incompleteness causes test failures for these predicates. The code block should be regenerated to include all required predicates to meet the specified requirements.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
