System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

% --------- Examples ---------- %
% Define some expand rules:

<Result> Here are the testing result of code:

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements for extended logic processing in ProbLog. The test results indicate that all queries return the expected output (1.0000), suggesting that the logic is correctly implemented and the code blocks work together as intended. However, there are minor potential issues and areas for improvement in the implementation.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No critical errors were identified in the code. The test results confirm that the logic for `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, and `refute/1` is functioning correctly. However, the following observations were made:
1. The `expand/2` predicate is not fully generalized; it relies on predefined rules (`double/1` and `square/1`), which may limit its utility.
2. The `extend/2` predicate does not verify the correctness of the extended list, which could lead to logical inconsistencies if misused.
3. The `refute/1` predicate is redundant with `opposite/1`, as both perform negation.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "E553CC07",
        "Report": "The extended logic processing block correctly implements all required predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, `refute/1`). However:
        1. The `expand/2` predicate is limited to specific arithmetic operations (`double/1` and `square/1`). It would be more flexible if it could handle user-defined expansion rules dynamically.
        2. The `extend/2` predicate assumes the input list is valid and does not perform any validation, which could lead to incorrect results if the input is malformed.
        3. The `refute/1` predicate duplicates the functionality of `opposite/1`, which could be streamlined by removing redundancy."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Generalize the `expand/2` predicate to allow dynamic expansion rules, possibly by adding a clause to register expansion rules at runtime.
2. Add validation to the `extend/2` predicate to ensure the input list is valid before extending it.
3. Remove the `refute/1` predicate or document its redundancy with `opposite/1` to avoid confusion.
4. Consider adding error handling or logging for edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs to `expand/2` or `extend/2`).
5. Document the predicates thoroughly to clarify their intended use and limitations.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
