  "Report": "The `bubblesort/3` and `bubble_pass/4` predicates contain logical flaws. The `->` operator is not correctly implemented for ProbLog, and the accumulation of the sorted list is not handled properly. Additionally, the `bubble_pass/4` predicate does not account for all edge cases, such as an empty list. The code fails to meet the requirement of implementing an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm due to syntax and logical errors.",

  "Report": "The `forth_sort/2` predicate and the query are not correctly integrated with the `bubblesort/3` logic. The query assumes a direct mapping, but the `bubblesort/3` implementation does not support this. This code block depends on the regeneration of the `bubblesort/3` implementation (HASH: 47D659C8) to function correctly.",
