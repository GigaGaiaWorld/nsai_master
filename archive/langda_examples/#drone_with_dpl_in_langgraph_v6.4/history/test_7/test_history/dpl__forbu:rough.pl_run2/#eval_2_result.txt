{"HASH": "47D659C8","Report": "The code block implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog but contains several issues. 1) The bubble_pass/4 predicate's base case doesn't properly handle the accumulator. 2) The main bubblesort/3 predicate incorrectly appends the remaining list when Flag=0. 3) The recursion in bubblesort/3 uses T instead of the updated list. 4) The test failure shows the implementation doesn't properly handle the sorting operation. The code needs complete regeneration to properly implement the bubble sort algorithm with correct list manipulation and termination conditions.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
