  "Report": "The code block contains several critical issues that prevent it from functioning correctly as a bubblesort implementation in ProbLog. The main problems are: 1) Use of unsupported '->' operator for conditionals, 2) Incorrect logic in both bubblesort/3 and bubble_pass/4 predicates, 3) Missing proper base case handling, and 4) Flawed sorting algorithm implementation. The test results clearly show these issues cause execution failures. The code needs complete regeneration to properly implement bubblesort using ProbLog-compatible syntax and correct algorithm logic.",
