System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).

bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, [], Updated, Flag),
    (Flag = 0,
     append(Acc, Updated, Sorted)
    ;
     Flag = 1,
     append(Acc, [Updated], NewAcc),
     bubblesort(Updated, NewAcc, Sorted)
    ).

bubble_pass([X, Y | T], Acc, Updated, Flag) :-
    (X > Y,
     bubble_pass([Y | T], [X | Acc], Updated, 1)
    ;
     X =< Y,
     bubble_pass([X | T], [Y | Acc], Updated, Flag)
    ).

bubble_pass([X], Acc, [X | Acc], 0).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],X2) = 0.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

    bubble_pass(List, [], Updated, Flag),
    (Flag = 0,

<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],X2) = 0.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The code is syntactically valid Prolog, but it fails to produce the expected output for the given test case. The test result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating that the query did not succeed. The issue lies in the logical implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, particularly in how the `bubble_pass` and `bubblesort` predicates interact." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "The primary issue is in the `bubblesort` predicate, where the logic for appending the accumulator (`Acc`) and handling the `Flag` is incorrect. Additionally, the `bubble_pass` predicate does not correctly update the `Flag` and the accumulator during the sorting process. These issues prevent the algorithm from sorting the list as intended." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "47D659C8",
        "Report": "The `bubblesort` predicate incorrectly appends the `Updated` list to the accumulator (`Acc`) when `Flag` is 1, which disrupts the sorting process. The `bubble_pass` predicate does not correctly propagate the `Flag` value, leading to incomplete sorting passes. The base case for `bubble_pass` also incorrectly sets the `Flag` to 0, which should reflect whether any swaps occurred during the pass."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Revise the `bubblesort` predicate to correctly handle the accumulator and `Flag` logic. Ensure that the `Updated` list is properly integrated into the accumulator. 2. Fix the `bubble_pass` predicate to accurately track swaps with the `Flag` and update the accumulator correctly. 3. Adjust the base case of `bubble_pass` to reflect whether swaps occurred during the pass. 4. Test the revised implementation with the provided query to verify correctness." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
