  "Report": "The code block contains several critical issues that prevent it from functioning correctly in ProbLog. The main problems are: 1) Use of unsupported `->` conditional statements which ProbLog cannot interpret, 2) Incorrect structure of `bubblesort/3` and `bubble_pass/4` predicates for ProbLog's syntax, 3) Improper use of `append/3` in a way that's incompatible with ProbLog's semantics. The code needs complete regeneration to implement the bubblesort algorithm using only ProbLog-supported constructs. The sorting logic should be reimplemented using basic recursion and pattern matching without relying on Prolog-specific control structures.",
