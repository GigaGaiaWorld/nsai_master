<Report>The `abandon(S,O)` predicate is defined to trigger when the adult sperm whale (ID 2) is at position `c`, regardless of the calf's position. This does not fully align with the requirement, which implies that abandonment occurs only if the adult sperm whale is at `c` and the calf is not protected (e.g., not between the adult and the orca). The current implementation oversimplifies the logic, leading to incorrect probabilities in the test results. The predicate should be refined to include the calf's position as a condition to accurately reflect the abandonment scenario.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
