Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The completed code block in the generated_code that replaces the <Langda> section is:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE","Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c), position(1,b)."}
```

Note that the generated code added an additional condition `position(1,b)` to the original predicate, which addresses the concern mentioned in the <Report> section about needing to consider the calf's position. This makes the abandonment condition more specific by requiring that the calf is at position b while the adult sperm whale is at position c.
