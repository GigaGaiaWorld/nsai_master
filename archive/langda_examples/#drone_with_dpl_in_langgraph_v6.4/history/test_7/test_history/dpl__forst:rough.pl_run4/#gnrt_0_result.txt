Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> block in the <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).\nstack_op(pop, [X|Rest], Rest).\nstack_op(dup, [X|Rest], [X,X|Rest]).\nstack_op(swap, [X,Y|Rest], [Y,X|Rest]).\nstack_op(over, [X,Y|Rest], [Y,X,Y|Rest]).\nstack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Rest], [Z,Y,X|Rest])."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "insertion_sort(List, Sorted) :-\n    insertion_sort(List, [], Sorted).\n\ninsertion_sort([], Acc, Acc).\ninsertion_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted) :-\n    insert(H, Acc, NewAcc),\n    insertion_sort(T, NewAcc, Sorted).\n\ninsert(X, [], [X]).\ninsert(X, [Y|T], [X,Y|T]) :- X =< Y.\ninsert(X, [Y|T], [Y|NewT]) :- X > Y, insert(X, T, NewT)."}
```

Note: I've included both the basic stack operations and the insertion sort implementation since they both appear to be part of completing the stack operations functionality mentioned in the requirements. The HASH value remains the same as in the original code block since both snippets are part of the same implementation.
