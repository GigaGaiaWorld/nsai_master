  "Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly implements the requirement for handling draws by passing the previous score unchanged. However, the predicate could be optimized for clarity by simplifying redundant operations (e.g., `S is S1` could be written as `S = S1`). No logical or syntax issues are present, and the test results confirm its correctness. Regeneration is not necessary, but minor stylistic improvements could be made.",

  "Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate correctly calculates the winner based on the score, as confirmed by the test results. However, it has a misplaced comma and inconsistent formatting, which could affect readability. Additionally, it lacks input validation (e.g., ensuring the input lists are of equal length). While the logic is sound, regeneration is recommended to address these issues and improve robustness. This block depends on the `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates, but neither requires regeneration.",
