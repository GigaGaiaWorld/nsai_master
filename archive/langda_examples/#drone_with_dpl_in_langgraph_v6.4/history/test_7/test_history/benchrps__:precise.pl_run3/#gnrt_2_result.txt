Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> blocks in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n length(P1Moves, Len),\n length(P2Moves, Len), % Ensure both lists are of equal length\n play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n compute_score(Results, S),\n ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n ; Winner = draw\n )."}
```

Note: There was only one <langda> block in the origin code, so only one corresponding code block was extracted from the generated code. The generated version includes input validation (length checks) and improved readability with the use of -> operators instead of commas in the conditional structure.
