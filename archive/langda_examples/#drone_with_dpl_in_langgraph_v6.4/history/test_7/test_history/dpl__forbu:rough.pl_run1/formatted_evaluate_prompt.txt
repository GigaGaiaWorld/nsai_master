System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).

bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped = true,
     bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
     Swapped = false,
     append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).

bubble_pass([X, Y | Rest], [Y | NewRest], true) :-
    X > Y,
    bubble_pass([X | Rest], NewRest, _).

bubble_pass([X, Y | Rest], [X | NewRest], Swapped) :-
    X =< Y,
    bubble_pass([Y | Rest], NewRest, Swapped).

bubble_pass([X], [X], false).

append([], L, L).
append([H | T], L, [H | R]) :-
    append(T, L, R).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped = true,

    ).

<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements a bubblesort algorithm and appears to be syntactically correct. The test result shows that the code successfully sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating that the logical correctness of the sorting functionality is confirmed for this test case. However, the code lacks probabilistic elements, which is a key feature of ProbLog. The integration between the `bubblesort/3` predicate and the `forth_sort/2` predicate is correct, but the latter does not leverage ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning capabilities.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Missing Probabilistic Elements**: The code does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features, such as probabilistic facts or annotated disjunctions, which are essential for ProbLog programs.
2. **Limited Test Coverage**: The test case provided is minimal and does not cover edge cases (e.g., empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, or already sorted lists).
3. **Unused ProbLog Features**: The `query` predicate is used, but the code does not take advantage of ProbLog's inference capabilities for probabilistic reasoning.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "47D659C8",
        "Report": "The `bubblesort/3` predicate is logically correct and implements the bubblesort algorithm as required. However, it is purely deterministic and does not incorporate any probabilistic elements, which is a missed opportunity for ProbLog's strengths. The `bubble_pass/3` and `append/3` helper predicates are also deterministic and correctly implemented."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for the `forth_sort/2` and `query` predicates)",
        "Report": "The `forth_sort/2` predicate correctly wraps `bubblesort/3` but does not add any probabilistic behavior. The `query` predicate is syntactically correct but does not leverage ProbLog's probabilistic inference, as the sorting is deterministic."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Add Probabilistic Elements**: Introduce probabilistic facts or rules to model uncertainty in the input list or sorting process. For example, the input list could be generated probabilistically.
2. **Expand Test Cases**: Include tests for edge cases (e.g., empty lists, lists with duplicates) to ensure robustness.
3. **Leverage ProbLog Features**: Use ProbLog's probabilistic inference to model scenarios where the sorting might have uncertain outcomes or inputs.
4. **Document Probabilistic Behavior**: Clearly document how the probabilistic aspects of the code are intended to work, as this is currently missing.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
