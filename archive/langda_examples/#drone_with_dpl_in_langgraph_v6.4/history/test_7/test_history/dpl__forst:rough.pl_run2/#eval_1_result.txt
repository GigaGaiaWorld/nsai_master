{"HASH": "5E40E418","Report": "The code block implements basic stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) correctly. The test results confirm that these operations work as intended with no syntax or logical errors. The requirements for stack operations are fully met for these predicates.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A (Additional Code Block)","Report": "The `sort` operation is partially implemented. While `get_top_n` is correctly defined, the `insertion_sort` predicate is missing, making the `sort` operation incomplete. This block requires regeneration to implement `insertion_sort` and potentially add error handling for edge cases. No test coverage exists for this operation.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
