  "Report": "The code block correctly defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors (move/1 and beats/2) and implements the compute_score/2 and determine_winner/3 predicates. However, it lacks the implementation of the play/3 predicate, which is essential for determining the outcome of each move pair (win, lose, or draw). This omission causes a runtime error ('No clauses found for play/3'). The code needs to be regenerated to include the play/3 predicate implementation.",
