  "Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate is logically correct and well-implemented for calculating scores based on a list of results (win, lose, or draw). However, it cannot function as intended because it depends on the missing `play/3` predicate to generate the input results list. The code block itself does not require regeneration, as the issue lies in the missing dependency rather than the implementation of this predicate.",
