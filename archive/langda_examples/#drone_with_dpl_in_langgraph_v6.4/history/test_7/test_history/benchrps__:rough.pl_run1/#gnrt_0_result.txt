Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. Since there's only one <Langda> block in the origin_code, here's the extracted code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "compute_score([], 0).\ncompute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.\ncompute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.\ncompute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.\n\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- \n    play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), \n    compute_score(Results,S), \n    ( S > 0, Winner = player1 \n    ; S < 0, Winner = player2 \n    ; S = 0, Winner = draw \n    ).\n\nquery(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W))."}
