{"HASH": "EF02D81B","Report": "The `game/3` predicate has critical issues: (1) It uses undefined variables `OwnCards` and `OpponentCards`, which should be passed from `game/4`. (2) The `best_hand_rank` calls may cause non-termination due to unbounded search in `hand` predicates. (3) It fails to properly integrate with `game/4`'s logic. Requires regeneration to fix variable scope and optimize hand-ranking logic.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "C53A4763","Report": "This block correctly implements the requirement for probabilistic house card selection and delegates to `game/3`. However, it inherits the timeout issue from `game/3`'s inefficiencies. Regeneration is only needed if `game/3`'s interface changes. Currently, it should work once `EF02D81B` is fixed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["EF02D81B"]}
