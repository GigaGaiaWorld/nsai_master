System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

% --------- Examples ---------- %
% Define some expand rules:
expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.
expand(square(X), Y) :- Y is X*X.
parent(alice, bob).

query(prove(includes([a,b,c],b))).
query(prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 1.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 1.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 1.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 1.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements for extended logic processing in the `prove/1` predicate. The test results indicate that all queries return the expected results (1.0000), confirming that the logic is correctly implemented and functioning as intended. The code integrates well with the basic meta-interpreter and the provided examples, demonstrating logical correctness and proper integration.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
No errors were identified in the code. All test cases passed successfully, and the implementation adheres to the specified requirements. The code is logically sound and syntactically correct.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "E553CC07",
        "Report": "The extended logic processing block correctly implements all specified requirements: `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, and `refute/1`. The predicates are defined accurately and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the code. The test results confirm their functionality."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Documentation**: While the code is functional, adding comments or documentation for each predicate in the extended logic processing block would improve readability and maintainability.
2. **Edge Cases**: Consider testing edge cases, such as empty lists for `includes/2` or invalid inputs for `expand/2`, to ensure robustness.
3. **Performance**: If the code is expected to handle large datasets, profiling the performance of the `prove/1` predicate might be beneficial to identify potential bottlenecks.
4. **Error Handling**: Although not required, adding error handling for malformed inputs (e.g., non-list inputs for `includes/2`) could enhance the code's reliability.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
