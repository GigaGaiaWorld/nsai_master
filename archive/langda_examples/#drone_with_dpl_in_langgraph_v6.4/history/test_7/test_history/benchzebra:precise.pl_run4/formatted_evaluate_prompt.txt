<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code is syntactically valid and correctly implements the specified requirements for the zebra puzzle. The test results confirm that the logic is sound, as the output matches the expected arrangement of houses and satisfies all the given constraints. The integration of the code blocks is seamless, and the predicates work together as intended.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No errors were identified in the code. The test results demonstrate that the code successfully solves the puzzle, adhering to all the rules and constraints provided.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "CD409C7B",
        "Report": "The code block is well-structured and correctly implements the zebra puzzle rules. All predicates (e.g., `my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are used appropriately to enforce the constraints. The test result confirms that the logic is correct, as the output satisfies all the given conditions."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. While the code is correct, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each predicate for better readability and maintainability.
2. If the code is part of a larger project, ensure that all dependencies (e.g., `houses`, `right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) are properly documented or imported.
3. For future enhancements, you could generalize the solution to handle variations of the puzzle or additional constraints.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
