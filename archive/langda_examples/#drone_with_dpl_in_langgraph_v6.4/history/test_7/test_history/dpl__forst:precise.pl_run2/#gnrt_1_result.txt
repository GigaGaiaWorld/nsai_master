Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, [X,Y,Z|Stack], SortedStack) :- \n    sort([X,Y,Z], [A,B,C]),\n    SortedStack = [A,B,C|Stack]."}
```

This JSON object contains:
- The HASH value from the original `<langda>` block
- The completed code snippet that replaces the `<langda>` placeholder in the original code
- The code is properly formatted with newline characters (`\n`) to maintain the original structure
