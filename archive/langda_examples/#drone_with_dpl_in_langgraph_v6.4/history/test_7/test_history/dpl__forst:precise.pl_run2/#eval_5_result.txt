  "Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete and does not fully meet the specified requirements. The current implementation attempts to sort the top 3 elements of the stack but lacks proper handling for edge cases (e.g., stacks with fewer than 3 elements). Additionally, the `sort` operation is not tested in the provided test cases, making it impossible to verify its correctness. The implementation should be revised to handle all cases (empty stack, 1 or 2 elements) and should include proper integration with the `get_top_n` predicate.",
