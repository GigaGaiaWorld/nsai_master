  "HASH": "6931D64E",
  "Report": "The `stack_op(sort, [X,Y,Z|Stack], SortedStack)` predicate is incomplete and incorrectly implemented. It sorts the top three elements but does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than three elements. Additionally, the predicate is not properly integrated with the rest of the code, leading to a parsing error. The implementation should be revised to handle edge cases and adhere to ProbLog syntax rules. The `get_top_n` predicate could be leveraged to simplify the extraction and reintegration of the top three elements.",
