Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    (   get_top_n(Stack, 3, Top3, Rest) ->\n        sort(Top3, SortedTop3),\n        append(SortedTop3, Rest, SortedStack)\n    ;   SortedStack = Stack\n    )."}
```

This JSON object contains:
1. The HASH value from the original <langda> block
2. The completed code snippet that was generated to replace the <langda> block in the origin_code
3. The code maintains proper formatting with newlines and indentation preserved

Note that this is the only code block that needed to be extracted since there was only one <langda> block in the origin_code.
