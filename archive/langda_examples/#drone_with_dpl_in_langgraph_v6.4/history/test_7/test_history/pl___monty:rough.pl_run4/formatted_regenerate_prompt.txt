System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The `open_door/1` predicate has significant issues that require regeneration: 1. **Syntax Error**: Invalid use of probabilistic annotation (`0.5::open_door(Door)`) inside predicate definition. ProbLog requires probabilities at the top level. 2. **Logical Flaws**: The current implementation conflates random and deterministic scenarios without proper separation. 3. **Incomplete Implementation**: Missing clear handling of the host's decision logic for different cases. Recommendations: 1. Split into separate predicates for random/deterministic cases. 2. Move probability declarations to top level. 3. Add explicit conditions for each scenario per requirements.</Report>

<Requirements>Define open_door/1 Predicate: Random Door Opening Rules Scenario: The remaining two doors are neither selected by the player nor have any prizes. Behavior: The host randomly opens one of the two "empty doors" with a 50% probability. Deterministic Door Opening Rules Scenario: The remaining two doors are neither selected by the player, one of which has a prize and the other does not. Behavior: The host must open the "empty door". </Requirements></Langda>

AI: 


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
