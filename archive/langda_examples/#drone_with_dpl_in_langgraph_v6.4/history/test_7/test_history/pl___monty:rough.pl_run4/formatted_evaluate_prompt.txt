<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem, including random and deterministic door-opening rules. However, the code is incomplete and contains logical and syntactic issues, leading to test failures. The primary issue is the absence of a defined `open_door/1` predicate, which is critical for the model's functionality. Additionally, the logic for door selection and prize distribution needs refinement to align with the specified requirements.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Missing Predicate Definition**: The error message indicates that no clauses are found for `open_door/1`, which is called in the `win_switch` rule. This is the root cause of the test failure.
2. **Incomplete Logic**: The `open_door_random/1` rule is defined but not integrated into the main logic, and its behavior does not fully align with the requirements (e.g., deterministic door opening is missing).
3. **Syntax Issues**: The `member/2` predicate is defined but not used effectively in the context of the problem.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "592D75CA",
        "Report": "The `open_door_random/1` rule is partially implemented. It correctly identifies doors that are neither selected nor contain the prize, but it lacks the deterministic behavior required when one of the remaining doors has a prize. Additionally, the rule is not referenced in the main logic, leading to its underutilization."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (Main Code Block)",
        "Report": "The main code block lacks the definition of `open_door/1`, which is essential for the `win_switch` rule. The `member/2` predicate is defined but not used to its full potential. The prize distribution and door selection logic are syntactically correct but need to be integrated with the door-opening rules."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Define `open_door/1` Predicate**: Implement the `open_door/1` predicate to handle both random and deterministic door-opening scenarios as specified in the requirements.
2. **Integrate `open_door_random/1`**: Ensure the `open_door_random/1` rule is properly integrated into the main logic and extended to cover deterministic cases.
3. **Refine Logic**: Adjust the logic to ensure the host's behavior aligns with the problem's requirements (e.g., opening the "empty door" deterministically when one door has a prize).
4. **Test Thoroughly**: After implementing the fixes, test the model to verify that it behaves as expected in all scenarios (random and deterministic door opening).
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
