{"HASH": "592D75CA","Report": "The `open_door_random/1` rule is partially implemented but lacks integration with the main logic and does not fully address the requirements. It correctly identifies non-selected, non-prize doors but misses the deterministic case where the host must open the empty door when one of the remaining doors has a prize. The rule also needs to be connected to the `open_door/1` predicate to resolve the test failure.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A (Main Code Block)","Report": "The main code block lacks the definition of `open_door/1`, which is critical for the `win_switch` rule and causes the test failure. The `member/2` predicate is defined but underutilized. The prize distribution and door selection logic are syntactically correct but need to be integrated with the door-opening rules to fulfill the requirements.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["592D75CA"]}
