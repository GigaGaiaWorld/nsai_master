System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The code block defines the zebra puzzle constraints but has several issues:
1. **Timeout Error**: The solver cannot resolve constraints efficiently, likely due to overly complex or redundant constraints.
2. **Logical Gaps**: Missing explicit enforcement of 'Someone has a zebra' and 'Someone drinks water'.
3. **Inefficient Ordering**: Constraints may not be ordered optimally for the solver.

Recommendations:
- Simplify and streamline constraints to reduce backtracking.
- Add explicit rules for missing requirements.
- Reorder constraints to prioritize the most restrictive ones first.
- Debug with smaller constraint subsets to isolate issues.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>
