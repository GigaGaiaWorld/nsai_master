  "Report": "The `my_member` predicate checks for the presence of the red house owned by the English, but it does not enforce any other constraints. This allows the red house to appear in any position, which violates the requirement that the Norwegian lives in the first house and other positional constraints. The predicate should be replaced or augmented with additional constraints to ensure all rules are enforced.",
