  "Report": "The code block defines the zebra puzzle constraints but has several issues:\n1. **Timeout Error**: The solver cannot resolve constraints efficiently, likely due to overly complex or redundant constraints.\n2. **Logical Gaps**: Missing explicit enforcement of 'Someone has a zebra' and 'Someone drinks water'.\n3. **Inefficient Ordering**: Constraints may not be ordered optimally for the solver.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Simplify and streamline constraints to reduce backtracking.\n- Add explicit rules for missing requirements.\n- Reorder constraints to prioritize the most restrictive ones first.\n- Debug with smaller constraint subsets to isolate issues.",
