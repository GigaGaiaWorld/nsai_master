  "Report": "The code block contains the core logic for solving the zebra puzzle with correct constraint specifications, but it fails due to undefined predicates (`member/2`, `houses/1`, `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`). The logical structure is sound, but the implementation is incomplete. The provided `my_member/2` predicate could be used to replace `member/2`, but other predicates must be defined.",
