  "Report": "The code block defines the constraints for the Zebra Puzzle but suffers from inefficiencies in the search space and constraint handling. The timeout error suggests the constraints are not optimized for ProbLog's inference engine. Recommendations include reordering constraints to prune the search space early (e.g., placing the milk constraint first), simplifying redundant checks, and leveraging ProbLog-specific features for better performance. The logical correctness is intact, but the implementation needs optimization to avoid timeout issues.",
