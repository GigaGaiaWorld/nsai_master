Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code.

The original <langda> block contained a placeholder for a member check, and based on the requirements, this needs to be expanded to include all the constraints. Here's the formatted JSON for the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CD409C7B","Code": "member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, spanish, _, dog, _), Houses),\nmember(house(green, _, coffee, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, ukrainian, tea, _, _), Houses),\nright_of(house(green, _, _, _, _), house(ivory, _, _, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, _, _, winstons), Houses),\nmember(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),\nHouses = [_, _, house(_, _, milk, _, _), _, _],\nHouses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)|_],\nnext_to(house(_, _, _, _, chesterfields), house(_, _, _, fox, _), Houses),\nnext_to(house(_, _, _, _, kools), house(_, _, _, horse, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, orange_juice, _, lucky_strikes), Houses),\nmember(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),\nnext_to(house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), house(blue, _, _, _, _), Houses)"}
