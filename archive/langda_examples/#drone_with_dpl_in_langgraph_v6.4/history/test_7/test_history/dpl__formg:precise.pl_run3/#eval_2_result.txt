  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: 1. It calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine if further splitting is needed. 2. It includes a recursive boundary check (`Len > 1`). 3. It splits the list into `Left` and `Right` for recursive processing. However, the same logic is duplicated in the unused `split_list` predicate, which is redundant. The block itself is correct and does not need regeneration, but the redundant `split_list` predicate should be removed for clarity.",

The `merge` predicate does not need regeneration, but the `append` predicate should be removed to simplify the codebase.",
