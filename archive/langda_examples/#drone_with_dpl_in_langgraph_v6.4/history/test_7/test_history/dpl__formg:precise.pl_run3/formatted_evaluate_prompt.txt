System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

length(Left, Half),

<Requirements>Should contain following rules: 1.Get the length of the current list, Len, to determine whether to continue splitting. 2.Recursive boundary judgment: Only lists with a length greater than 1 need to be sorted, otherwise they are sorted by default. 3.Split the list into two parts, Left and Right, for subsequent recursive processing. </Requirements></Langda>

<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test result shows that it correctly sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the given test case. However, there are minor issues and redundancies that could be improved for better clarity and efficiency.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Redundant Code**: The `split_list` predicate is defined but not used in the main `merge_sort` predicate. Instead, the splitting logic is duplicated in the `merge_sort` predicate.
2. **Unnecessary Predicate**: The `append` predicate is defined but not necessary for the merge sort logic, as the splitting is already handled by `length` and `append` in the `merge_sort` predicate.
3. **Potential Inefficiency**: The recursive splitting and merging logic could be optimized for larger lists, though this is not a critical issue for the given test case.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "95E704F2",
        "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: 
        1. It calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine if further splitting is needed.
        2. It includes a recursive boundary check (`Len > 1`).
        3. It splits the list into `Left` and `Right` for recursive processing.
        However, the same logic is duplicated in the unused `split_list` predicate, which is redundant."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `merge` predicate is correctly implemented and handles the merging of two sorted lists. The `append` predicate is also correctly defined but is unnecessary for the merge sort logic."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Remove Redundant Code**: Eliminate the `split_list` predicate since its logic is already embedded in the `merge_sort` predicate.
2. **Optimize the Code**: Consider using a more efficient splitting method for larger lists, though this is not critical for the current implementation.
3. **Clean Up**: Remove the unused `append` predicate to simplify the codebase.
4. **Testing**: Extend testing to include edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate elements to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
