{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements by checking the list length and splitting it when necessary. However, the implementation of `split_list` is inefficient due to its use of `append` for splitting. A more direct approach using list indexing or slicing would be better. This inefficiency warrants regeneration of the code block to improve performance.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements by recursively sorting and merging the sublists. The logic is sound, and the merging steps are correctly implemented. No issues are identified in this block, and it does not need regeneration.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
