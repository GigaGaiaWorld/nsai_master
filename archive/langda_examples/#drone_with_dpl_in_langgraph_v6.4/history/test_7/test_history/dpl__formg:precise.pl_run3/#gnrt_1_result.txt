Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code was replaced by the following code in generated_code:
```prolog
length(List, Len), Len > 1,
Half is Len // 2,
length(Left, Half),
append(Left, Right, List)
```

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2","Code": "length(List, Len), Len > 1,\nHalf is Len // 2,\nlength(Left, Half),\nappend(Left, Right, List)"}
```

Note: I've maintained the original HASH value "95E704F2" from the <langda> block, as this appears to be the identifier for this specific code segment. The code has been formatted to match the implementation in the generated_code while fulfilling all the requirements specified in the origin_code's <Requirements> section.
