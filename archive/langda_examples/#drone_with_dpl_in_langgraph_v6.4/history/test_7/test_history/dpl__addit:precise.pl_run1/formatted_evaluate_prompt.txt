System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- 

    number(X, XNum),
    number(Y, YNum),
    Z is XNum + YNum.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],391) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is designed to convert a list of image identifiers into a numerical value and perform addition on two such numbers. The test result shows that the addition of [img_7, img_9] (79) and [img_3, img_1, img_2] (312) yields 391, which is correct. However, the code has several issues, including incomplete predicates and logical inconsistencies.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. The predicate `multi_addition/3` is incomplete and lacks a closing period.
2. The `number/3` predicate is not fully implemented as per the requirements. Specifically, it does not handle the case where the input list is empty, and the logic for accumulating the result is flawed.
3. The `number/2` predicate is redundant and could be simplified.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6579E7BA",
        "Report": "The `number/3` predicate is intended to convert a list of images into a number by processing each image recursively. However, the current implementation does not correctly accumulate the result. The requirement specifies that the 'low bit' should be added to the accumulated value, but the current logic (`NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr`) adds the 'high bit' instead. Additionally, the base case `number([], Result, Result).` is correct but not integrated properly with the recursive case."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is incomplete and lacks a closing period. The logic for adding two numbers is correct, but the predicate is syntactically invalid due to the missing period."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Fix the `number/3` predicate to correctly accumulate the result by reversing the order of operations. For example, use `NewAcc is Acc + Nr * (10 ^ Length)` where `Length` is the position of the digit.
2. Complete the `multi_addition/3` predicate by adding the missing period.
3. Simplify the `number/2` predicate or remove it if it is redundant.
4. Ensure all predicates are properly integrated and tested for edge cases, such as empty lists or single-element lists.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
