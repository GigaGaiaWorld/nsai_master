{"HASH": "6579E7BA","Report": "The `number/3` predicate processes the list from left to right, which means the first digit (leftmost) becomes the least significant digit (low bit). This contradicts the requirement that the high bit should be on the right. For example, `[img_3, img_4]` should yield `34`, but the current implementation yields `43`. The logic needs to be adjusted to ensure the leftmost digit is the most significant bit (high bit on the right).","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate correctly uses `number/2` to convert image lists to numbers, but the underlying `number/3` logic is flawed. This causes the addition to be performed on incorrectly converted numbers. However, the issue stems from the `number/3` predicate, so this block does not need regeneration unless the `number/3` logic is corrected first.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["6579E7BA"]}
