{"HASH": "6579E7BA","Report": "The `number/3` predicate incorrectly uses `length/1`, which is not a valid function in ProbLog. The logic for accumulating the numerical value (`NewAcc is Acc + Nr * (10 ^ length(T))`) does not align with the requirement to add the current number to the 'low bit' (rightmost digit). The recursive logic should instead append the digit to the right of the accumulated value (e.g., `NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr`). This block needs regeneration to fix both the syntax and logical errors.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is incomplete and does not correctly implement the addition of two numbers derived from image lists. It depends on the correct implementation of `number/3` (HASH: 6579E7BA), which needs regeneration. Once `number/3` is fixed, this block should also be regenerated to properly handle the addition and return the result.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["6579E7BA"]}
