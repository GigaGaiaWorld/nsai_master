System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>% Insertion Sort in ProbLog

% Base case: inserting an element into an empty list
insert(X, [], [X]).

% Recursive case: inserting an element into a sorted list
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :- X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :- X > Y, insert(X, Ys, Zs).

% Base case: empty list is already sorted
insertion_sort([], []).

% Recursive case: sort the tail and insert the head
insertion_sort([X|Xs], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(Xs, SortedTail),
    insert(X, SortedTail, Sorted).

% Query example
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 501F546D </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The provided ProbLog code for the insertion sort algorithm is syntactically correct and logically sound. The test result confirms that the implementation works as expected, producing the correct sorted output for the given input list. The code adheres to the requirements of implementing an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No errors were identified in the code. The test result matches the expected output, indicating that the implementation is correct." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "501F546D",
        "Report": "The code block implements the insertion sort algorithm correctly. The base and recursive cases for both the insert/3 and insertion_sort/2 predicates are properly defined. The query example demonstrates the functionality, and the test result confirms the correctness of the implementation."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"No fixes are required for this code. However, for further validation, additional test cases with varying input lists (e.g., empty lists, already sorted lists, lists with duplicate elements) could be added to ensure robustness." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
