    "Report": "The code block implements the insertion sort algorithm correctly in ProbLog. The implementation includes proper base and recursive cases for both the insert/3 and insertion_sort/2 predicates. The test result confirms the correctness of the implementation, producing the expected sorted output for the given input list. The code fully meets the requirements of implementing an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm.",
