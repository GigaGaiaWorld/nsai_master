System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code_Block>merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).

merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    List = [_,_|_], % Ensure the list has at least two elements
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

split([], [], []).

    X =< Y,
    merge(Left, [Y|Right], Merged).

append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test result shows that it correctly sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000. This indicates that the core logic of the merge sort is functioning as expected. However, there are some minor issues and potential improvements to consider, particularly in the integration of the code blocks and the clarity of the requirements.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Integration Issue**: The `append/3` predicate is included in the code but is not used in the merge sort implementation. This could lead to confusion or unintended behavior if not properly documented or removed.
2. **Redundant Code**: The `append/3` predicate is redundant for the merge sort implementation and does not contribute to the functionality.
3. **Clarity of Requirements**: The requirement specifies an "interpretable" merge sort, but the code does not include any probabilistic or interpretable elements (e.g., uncertainty handling or explanations). This might be a mismatch between the requirements and the implementation.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "418D2062",
        "Report": "The merge sort implementation is logically correct and syntactically valid. It correctly splits the list, recursively sorts the sublists, and merges them back together. The test result confirms its functionality. However, the requirement for an 'interpretable' merge sort is not addressed in this code block. If interpretability involves probabilistic reasoning or explanations, this block lacks such features."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for the `append/3` predicate)",
        "Report": "The `append/3` predicate is syntactically correct but is unused in the merge sort implementation. Its presence is unnecessary and could be removed to avoid confusion. If it was intended for debugging or testing, it should be documented as such."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Remove Redundant Code**: Remove the `append/3` predicate unless it serves a documented purpose outside the merge sort implementation.
2. **Clarify Requirements**: If the requirement for an "interpretable" merge sort involves probabilistic reasoning or explanations, update the code to include such features (e.g., using ProbLog's probabilistic predicates or adding explanatory comments).
3. **Documentation**: Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and the overall logic of the merge sort algorithm, especially if the code is intended for educational or interpretable purposes.
4. **Testing**: Expand the test cases to include edge cases (e.g., empty lists, lists with duplicate elements) to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
