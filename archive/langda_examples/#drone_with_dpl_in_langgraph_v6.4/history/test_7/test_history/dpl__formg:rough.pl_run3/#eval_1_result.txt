  "Report": "The merge sort implementation is logically correct and syntactically valid. It correctly splits the list, recursively sorts the sublists, and merges them back together. The test result confirms its functionality. However, the requirement for an 'interpretable' merge sort is not addressed in this code block. If interpretability involves probabilistic reasoning or explanations, this block lacks such features. Recommendations: 1) Clarify or update requirements to specify what 'interpretable' entails. 2) If interpretability is not critical, the code block is functionally correct and does not need regeneration. 3) If interpretability is required (e.g., probabilistic sorting), regenerate with additional features.",

  "Report": "The `append/3` predicate is syntactically correct but unused in the merge sort implementation. Its presence is redundant and could lead to confusion. Recommendations: 1) Remove this predicate unless it serves a documented purpose (e.g., testing). 2) No regeneration is needed for the merge sort logic, but the file should be cleaned up.",
