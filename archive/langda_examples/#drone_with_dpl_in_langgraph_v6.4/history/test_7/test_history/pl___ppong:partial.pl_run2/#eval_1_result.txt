Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
  "HASH": "12E8365D",
  "Report": "The `team_strength` predicate for a single team member is correctly implemented as per requirements. The only issue is a minor typo in the predicate name (`team_strength` appears in the analysis, but the actual code shows correct spelling). No functional issues found. Test results align with expected behavior.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "766936E0",
  "Report": "The `team_strength` predicate for multiple members correctly implements the 'minimum' requirement. While functional, it could be optimized to avoid redundant calculations when processing list tails. However, this doesn't affect correctness. The test results show proper probabilistic behavior, so regeneration isn't critical.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": ["12E8365D"]
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "2A6AD51D",
  "Report": "The `wins` predicate correctly implements the winning condition but has two potential improvements needed: 1) No tie-handling (though requirements don't specify this), and 2) The negation in the second clause could be clearer. Since test results show expected probabilities and requirements don't mention ties, regeneration isn't strictly necessary.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": ["12E8365D", "766936E0"]
}
```

Key observations:
1. No code blocks require regeneration as all implement requirements correctly and test results validate their behavior
2. All dependencies are properly maintained (multi-team depends on single-team, wins depends on both)
3. Suggested improvements are optional optimizations/clarifications rather than fixes
4. The typo mentioned in the analysis appears to be an error in the analysis itself rather than the actual code
