Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code was for the move 'scissor' (with a typo), and in generated_code this was corrected to 'scissors'. Here's the formatted output:

```problog
{"HASH": "BF964057","Code": "move(scissors)."}
