  "Report": "The code block defines the move 'scissor' which is misspelled and inconsistent with the rest of the code where 'scissors' is used (e.g., in the beats predicate). This typo could lead to logical inconsistencies or errors if the code is extended or reused. The requirement was to define the move for 'scissor', but the correct term should be 'scissors' for consistency.",
