Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Code": "move(scissor)."}
```

Note that while the original <Langda> block showed "move(scissors)." in the <Code_Block>, the generated code actually uses "move(scissor)." to maintain consistency with the rest of the predicates (which all use "scissor" in singular form). This matches the report's observation about the inconsistency between "scissors" and "scissor" in the original code.
