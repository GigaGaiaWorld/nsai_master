  "Report": "The code block defines stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, `sort`) correctly. The tested operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) work as expected. However, the `sort` operation is incomplete due to the missing `insertion_sort` predicate. This could cause the `sort` operation to fail or produce incorrect results. The block needs regeneration to either implement `insertion_sort` or remove the `sort` operation if it is not required.",

The `get_top_n` predicate is correctly implemented, but its dependency on `insertion_sort` is unresolved.
