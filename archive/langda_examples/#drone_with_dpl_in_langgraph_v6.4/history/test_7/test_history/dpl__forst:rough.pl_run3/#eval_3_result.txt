  "Report": "The first code block defines stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, `sort`) correctly. The `sort` operation includes a conditional check for stacks with at least 3 elements, which is a good practice. However, the implementation of `get_top_n` is missing, and the `sort` operation is not tested in the provided results. The block is logically correct for the operations that were tested, but the `sort` operation's correctness cannot be verified without the missing `get_top_n` implementation.",

```report
{
  "HASH": "N/A (second block lacks a hash)",
  "Report": "The second code block attempts to implement the `sort` operation but introduces logical errors. The `get_top_n` predicate is incorrectly implemented, as it does not extract the top `N` elements from the stack. Additionally, the `insertion_sort` predicate is undefined, leading to potential runtime errors. The lack of a fallback for small stacks (as in the first block) is also a concern. This block needs regeneration to correct these issues and ensure consistency with the first block.",
