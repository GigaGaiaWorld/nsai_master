  "Report": "The code block implements basic stack operations correctly (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) as evidenced by successful test results. However, the sort operation is incomplete due to: (1) Undefined insertion_sort predicate, (2) No error handling in get_top_n for stacks smaller than N elements, and (3) Missing test coverage for the sort operation. The block needs partial regeneration to complete the sort functionality and add robustness checks.",
