Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code is incomplete and needs to be completed with the logic for the "abandon" predicate. Here's the extracted and formatted code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)."}
```

This completes the predicate definition according to the requirements specified in the <Langda> block, which states that when:
- the adult sperm whale (ID 2) is of gender S
- the orca (ID 3) is of gender O
- the adult sperm whale is at position c
then it means the adult sperm whale abandons the calf.
