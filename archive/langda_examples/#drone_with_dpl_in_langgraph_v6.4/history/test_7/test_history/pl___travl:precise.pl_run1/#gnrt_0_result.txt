Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \+susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptiple(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

This code implements:
1. Contact transmission with different probabilities based on susceptibility
2. Additional infection risk from travel
3. Matches the requirements specified in the <Langda> section
4. Uses the correct hash E09B4F54 from the origin code
