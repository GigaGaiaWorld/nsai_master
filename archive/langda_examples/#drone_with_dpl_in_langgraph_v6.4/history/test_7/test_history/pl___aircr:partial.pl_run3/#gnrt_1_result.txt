Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. Here's the JSON formatted output:

```problog
{"HASH": "779B4ADF", "Code": "goal_reached(Time) :-\n flap_position(Time,Pos),\n goal(Pos)."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <Langda> tags in the origin_code, and it appears unchanged in the generated_code. The JSON output includes the hash from the original tag and the completed code snippet that replaces the <Langda> block.
