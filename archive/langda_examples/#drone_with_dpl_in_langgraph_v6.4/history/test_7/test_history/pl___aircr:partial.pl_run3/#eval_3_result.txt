  "Report": "The `goal_reached(Time)` predicate is incomplete and does not account for all conditions necessary to correctly determine if the goal has been reached. Specifically, it checks if the flap position matches the goal position (`Pos == GP`) but does not verify whether the flap position was updated legally (i.e., without an overrun exception). This could lead to incorrect goal detection, especially in cases where the flap position is not updated due to an overrun or other constraints. The test results show decreasing probabilities for `goal_reached`, which may indicate this issue. The predicate should also ensure that the flap position is legal and updated before checking for goal attainment.",
