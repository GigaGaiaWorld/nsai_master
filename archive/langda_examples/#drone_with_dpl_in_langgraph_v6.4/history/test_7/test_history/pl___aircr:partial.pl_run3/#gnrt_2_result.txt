Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the completed code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "779B4ADF", "Code": "goal_reached(Time) :-\n flap_position(Time,Pos),\n goal(GP),\n Pos == GP."}
```

This is the only code block that was completed in the generated_code that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. The completed version:
1. Includes the missing goal(GP) predicate
2. Adds the comparison Pos == GP to properly check if the current position matches the goal
3. Maintains the same hash (779B4ADF) from the original incomplete block
