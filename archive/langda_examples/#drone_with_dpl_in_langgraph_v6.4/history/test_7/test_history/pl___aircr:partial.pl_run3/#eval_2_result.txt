  "Report": "The `goal_reached` predicate is incomplete as it references `goal(Pos)` without providing its definition in the code block. This could lead to undefined behavior or errors during execution. The predicate should be completed to properly check if the current flap position matches the target goal. Additionally, the test results show decreasing probabilities for `goal_reached`, indicating potential logical issues in how the goal is being checked or updated.",
