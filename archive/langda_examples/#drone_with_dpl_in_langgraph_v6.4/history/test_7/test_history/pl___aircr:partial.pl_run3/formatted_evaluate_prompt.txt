System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The code is syntactically valid and implements the basic requirements of an aircraft flap controller. However, there are logical inconsistencies and potential issues in the implementation that affect the correctness and reliability of the results. The test results show non-zero probabilities for `overrun_exception` and decreasing probabilities for `goal_reached`, which may indicate inefficiencies or errors in the logic.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Logical Inconsistency in `goal_reached`**: The predicate `goal_reached(Time)` does not correctly check if the flap position matches the goal position due to a missing clause in the code block.
2. **Wind Effect Model**: The wind effect probabilities are not normalized, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. **Actuator Selection**: The random selection of actuators (`use_actuator`) may not optimally contribute to reaching the goal, as the probabilities are fixed and not adaptive.
4. **Overrun Exception Handling**: The `overrun_exception` predicate shows non-zero probabilities, indicating that the flap position sometimes goes out of bounds, which should be addressed.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "779B4ADF",
        "Report": "The `goal_reached(Time)` predicate is incomplete. It checks if the flap position matches the goal position but does not account for the case where the flap position is not updated due to an overrun or other constraints. This could lead to incorrect goal detection."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix `goal_reached` Predicate**: Ensure the `goal_reached(Time)` predicate correctly checks all conditions, including whether the flap position is updated and legal.
2. **Normalize Wind Effect Probabilities**: Adjust the wind effect probabilities to ensure they sum to 1 for each wind strength condition.
3. **Optimize Actuator Selection**: Consider dynamic probabilities for actuator selection based on the current flap position and goal.
4. **Improve Overrun Handling**: Add constraints or corrective actions to prevent the flap position from going out of bounds, reducing the probability of `overrun_exception`.
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for edge cases, such as extreme wind effects or actuator failures, to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
