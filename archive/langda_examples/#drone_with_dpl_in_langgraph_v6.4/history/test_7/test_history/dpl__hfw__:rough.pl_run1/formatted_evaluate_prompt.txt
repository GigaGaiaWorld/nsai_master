<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code aims to implement a recursive expression evaluator in ProbLog, capable of parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions involving numbers and operators. The test results indicate a failure due to an unknown clause error, suggesting a mismatch between the predicate definitions and their usage. The overall structure of the code is logical, but the integration between the predicate definitions and the query execution is flawed.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Unknown Clause Error**: The error message indicates that the predicate `parse/2` is not recognized or improperly defined when the query is executed. This suggests a scoping or definition issue in the ProbLog environment.
2. **Integration Issue**: The `parse/2` predicate is defined in a separate code block, but it is not properly integrated with the main code, leading to the unknown clause error.
3. **Division by Zero Handling**: While the code includes a check for division by zero, the error handling might not be propagated correctly in the ProbLog environment.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "190031BC",
        "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is correctly implemented to handle arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) recursively. However, the error arises because this predicate is not properly integrated into the main ProbLog code. The predicate definition is isolated and not accessible during query execution."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The main code block defines predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `detect_all/2`, which are used to parse images into symbols. The `expression/2` predicate attempts to use `parse/2`, but the latter is not defined in the same scope, causing the unknown clause error."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Integrate `parse/2` into the Main Code**: Ensure the `parse/2` predicate is defined in the same ProbLog program as the rest of the predicates. This will resolve the unknown clause error.
2. **Test Division by Zero**: Verify that the division by zero check works as expected in the ProbLog environment. If not, adjust the error handling to ensure it propagates correctly.
3. **Validate Symbol Detection**: Ensure the `detect_all/2` predicate correctly processes the input list of images into symbols before passing them to `parse/2`.
4. **Debugging**: Use ProbLog's debugging tools to trace the execution and identify any further integration issues.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
