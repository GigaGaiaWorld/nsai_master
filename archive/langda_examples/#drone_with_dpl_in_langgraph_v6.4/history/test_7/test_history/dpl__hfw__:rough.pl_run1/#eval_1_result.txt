  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is intended to recursively evaluate arithmetic expressions. However, it has the following issues:\n1. **Base Case Handling**: The base case `parse([N], N).` is correct, but the recursive case does not properly handle the accumulation of intermediate results. The recursive call `parse([Temp | Rest], Result)` assumes that `Rest` is a list of symbols, but it may not always be the case, leading to errors.\n2. **Operator Precedence**: The predicate does not account for operator precedence (e.g., multiplication before addition), which could lead to incorrect evaluations.\n3. **Error Handling**: The predicate lacks error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero or unrecognized operators).\n\nRecommendations:\n1. **Fix the `parse/2` Predicate**: Ensure the recursive case correctly processes the remaining symbols after each operation. Add error handling for division by zero and invalid operators. Consider implementing operator precedence or using parentheses to enforce evaluation order.\n2. **Test with Simpler Cases**: Start by testing the `parse/2` predicate with simpler expressions (e.g., `[2, '+', 3]`) to isolate and fix issues before scaling to more complex cases.\n3. **Debugging**: Use ProbLog's debugging tools to trace the execution of the `parse/2` predicate and identify where it fails.\n4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the expected input format for the `expression/2` predicate to avoid confusion.",
