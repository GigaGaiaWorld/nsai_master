  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate contains critical issues that prevent it from functioning correctly. The primary problems are: 1) Syntax error due to improper use of the conditional operator (`->`) in ProbLog, which is not supported in this context. 2) Logical flaws in recursive expression evaluation, including improper handling of edge cases like division by zero. 3) Incorrect integration with the `detect_all/2` predicate, leading to runtime errors. The predicate fails to meet the requirements for a recursive expression evaluator capable of handling all specified arithmetic operations.",
