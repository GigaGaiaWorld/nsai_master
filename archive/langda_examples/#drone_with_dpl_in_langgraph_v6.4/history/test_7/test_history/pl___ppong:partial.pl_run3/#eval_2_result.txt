  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement of calculating team strength as the minimum of individual strengths. The syntax and logic are correct, and it integrates well with other code blocks. However, the test results show a slight imbalance in probabilities, which might be due to the lazy predicate's effect on strength calculation rather than this specific code block. The issue appears to be more related to the lazy predicate's implementation and its impact on strength values, not the team_strength calculation itself.",
