{"HASH": "766936E0","Report": "The code implements the requirement for multiplayer teams by taking the minimum strength of all members. While this aligns with the requirement, it may not be the most intuitive or competitive metric. For example, a team with one very strong member and one weak member will have the same strength as a team with two weak members. This could be revised to use an average or weighted sum for a more realistic representation.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["12E8365D"]}

```report
{"HASH": "2A6AD51D","Report": "The code correctly determines the winner based on team strength comparison. However, the issue lies in how team strength is calculated (using the minimum), which may not reflect the intended competitive dynamics. The `lazy` predicate's impact on strength is also not fully leveraged here.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["766936E0"]}
