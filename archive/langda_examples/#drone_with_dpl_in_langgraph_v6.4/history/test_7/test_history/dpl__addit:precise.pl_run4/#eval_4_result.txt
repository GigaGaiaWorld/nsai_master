  "Report": "The `number/3` predicate has several issues: 1. It uses the undefined `length/1` function, causing a runtime error. 2. The accumulation logic is incorrect - it should multiply the accumulator by 10 and add the new digit (right-to-left processing) rather than using exponentiation. 3. While the base case is correct, the recursive case doesn't properly implement the requirements of placing the high bit on the right. The predicate needs complete regeneration to properly convert image lists to numbers by processing digits from left to right while maintaining correct positional values.",

  "Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is incomplete and non-functional. While it correctly calls `number/2` to convert both operands, it lacks proper variable handling and arithmetic implementation. The predicate needs regeneration to: 1. Properly handle the conversion of both input lists 2. Correctly perform the addition operation 3. Return the result in variable Z. This regeneration should wait until the `number/3` predicate is fixed as it depends on that functionality.",
