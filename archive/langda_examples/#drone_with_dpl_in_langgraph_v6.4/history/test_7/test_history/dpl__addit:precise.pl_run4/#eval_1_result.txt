{"HASH": "6579E7BA","Report": "The `number/3` predicate incorrectly accumulates digits by placing the new digit in the high bit (right side) instead of the low bit (left side). This causes the numerical value to be reversed (e.g., [img_3, img_4] yields 43 instead of 34). The logic `NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr` must be revised to prepend the new digit to the left. This is a critical logical error that affects the correctness of the entire program.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is syntactically correct and follows the requirements, but its functionality depends entirely on the correctness of `number/3`. Since `number/3` is flawed, `multi_addition/3` also produces incorrect results. However, once `number/3` is fixed, this predicate should work as intended. No regeneration is needed for this block itself.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["6579E7BA"]}
