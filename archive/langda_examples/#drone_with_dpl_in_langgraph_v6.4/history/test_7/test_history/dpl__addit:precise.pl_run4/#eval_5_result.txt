    "Report": "The `number/3` predicate is intended to convert a list of images into a number by recursively processing each image. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the 'low bit' addition as specified. The logic should ensure that each new digit is added to the least significant position of the accumulated value. The current implementation (`NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr`) adds the digit to the most significant position, which is incorrect for the given requirements. The predicate needs to be regenerated to correctly implement the requirement of adding digits to the 'low bit' (least significant position) of the accumulated value.",
