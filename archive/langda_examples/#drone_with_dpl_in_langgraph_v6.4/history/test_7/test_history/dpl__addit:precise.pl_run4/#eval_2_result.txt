  "Report": "The `number/3` predicate is intended to convert a list of images into a numerical value by recursively processing each image. However, it incorrectly uses the `length/1` function, which is not available in ProbLog. Additionally, the logic for accumulating the numerical value (with the high bit on the right) is flawed. The predicate should instead use a counter or another method to track the positional weight of digits. The current implementation fails to meet the requirements and causes the test to fail.",

  "Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is syntactically correct but logically dependent on the flawed `number/3` predicate. It will not function as intended until the underlying issues in `number/3` are resolved. However, since the issue lies in the dependency (`number/3`) and not in this predicate itself, regeneration is not needed for this block. Instead, the dependent block (`number/3`) should be regenerated first.",
