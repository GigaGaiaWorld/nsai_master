System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- 

    number(X, XNum),
    number(Y, YNum),
    Z is XNum + YNum.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],391) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is designed to convert a list of image identifiers into a numerical value and perform addition on two such numbers. The test result shows that the addition of [img_7, img_9] (79) and [img_3, img_1, img_2] (312) yields 391, which is correct. However, the code has several issues, including incomplete predicates and logical inconsistencies.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. The predicate `multi_addition/3` is incomplete and lacks a proper body.
2. The `number/3` predicate is partially implemented but does not fully adhere to the requirements (e.g., handling the "low bit" addition correctly).
3. The `number/2` predicate is redundant and could be simplified.
4. The `digit/2` facts are correctly defined but not utilized optimally in the recursive logic.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6579E7BA",
        "Report": "The `number/3` predicate is intended to convert a list of images into a number by recursively processing each image. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the 'low bit' addition as specified. The logic should ensure that each new digit is added to the least significant position of the accumulated value. The current implementation (`NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr`) adds the digit to the most significant position, which is incorrect for the given requirements."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is incomplete and lacks a body. It should call `number/3` for both input lists, sum the results, and bind the result to `Z`. The current implementation is missing the logic to perform the addition."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Fix the `number/3` predicate to correctly add digits to the least significant position of the accumulated value. For example, use `NewAcc is Acc + Nr * (10 ^ Length)` where `Length` is the remaining length of the list.
2. Complete the `multi_addition/3` predicate by adding the logic to sum the two numbers obtained from `number/3`.
3. Remove the redundant `number/2` predicate or ensure it aligns with the corrected `number/3` logic.
4. Verify the corrected implementation with additional test cases to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
