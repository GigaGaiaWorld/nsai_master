Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. Here's the result:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),
    Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _,_],
    Houses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)|_],
    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,chesterfields), house(_,_,fox,_,_), Houses),
    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,kools), house(_,_,horse,_,_), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),
    next_to(house(_,norwegian,_,_,_), house(blue,_,_,_,_), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)."}
```

Note that this is the exact code block that was marked with the <Langda> tag in the origin_code, with the hash "0F506A43" that was provided in the origin_code's report section. The generated_code shows this block was completed correctly in the final version.
