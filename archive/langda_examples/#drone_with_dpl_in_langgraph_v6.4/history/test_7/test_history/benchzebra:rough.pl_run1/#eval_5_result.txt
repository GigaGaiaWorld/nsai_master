    "Report": "The code block is incomplete and contains syntax errors, leading to a timeout during testing. The logical structure of the zebra puzzle is partially implemented but lacks proper termination and integration with the `houses` predicate. The constraints are not fully enforced, causing logical gaps and potential infinite loops. Recommendations: 1. Complete the code block with proper termination. 2. Ensure all puzzle constraints are properly integrated with the `houses` predicate. 3. Debug the logic to prevent infinite loops or excessive computation.",
