  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains syntax errors. The `zebra` rule is missing a closing parenthesis and a period. Additionally, the constraints in the rule may not be sufficient to uniquely solve the puzzle, leading to potential infinite loops or excessive backtracking. The timeout error during testing suggests that the code is either too inefficient or logically flawed. Recommendations include fixing the syntax errors, optimizing the constraints, and testing the code incrementally to identify performance bottlenecks.",
