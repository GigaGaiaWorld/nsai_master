  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains invalid syntax (`<Langda>`). The constraints in the `zebra` predicate are not fully implemented, leading to potential logical gaps. For example, the `next_to` and `my_member` predicates are used, but their constraints may not cover all necessary conditions to solve the puzzle uniquely. The timeout error suggests that the solver is unable to find a solution within the expected time, likely due to inefficient or incorrect constraints. Recommendations include removing the `<Langda>` placeholder, verifying all constraints are correctly specified, and optimizing performance by simplifying or reordering constraints.",
