System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

TimeoutError: Function timed out while processing file: benchzebra:rough.pl_run1</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The code is incomplete and contains syntax errors, leading to a timeout during testing. The logical structure of the zebra puzzle is partially implemented, but missing critical components and proper integration." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "1. Syntax Error: The code block under <Langda> is incomplete and lacks proper termination. 2. Logical Error: The `houses` predicate is not fully utilized to enforce constraints. 3. Timeout: The incomplete logic causes infinite loops or excessive computation." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "0F506A43",
        "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks proper termination. The `houses` predicate is not fully integrated with the constraints, leading to logical gaps."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Complete the code block under <Langda> with proper termination and constraints. 2. Ensure the `houses` predicate enforces all puzzle constraints. 3. Debug the logic to prevent infinite loops or excessive computation." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
