  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and lacks proper termination. The constraints are logically sound but are not properly integrated into the `zebra` predicate. Additionally, the `houses` predicate defines a fixed list of 5 houses, which may not align with the constraints, leading to potential logical inconsistencies. The timeout error suggests inefficiency or infinite loops during execution.",
