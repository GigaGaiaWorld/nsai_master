Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "0C388A60", "Report": "The code block defines `move(paper).` correctly. It implements the required move of paper and integrates well with the rest of the code. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Report": "The code block defines `move(scissor).` with a typo. It should be `move(scissors).` for consistency with the rest of the code. This affects the beats predicate that references this move.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["58D60F5E"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "59C3D0D4", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(paper, rock).` correctly. It implements the required win-lose relationship of paper and integrates well with the rest of the code. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(scissor, paper).` with a typo (should be `scissors`). This depends on the move definition being corrected first. The logic is otherwise correct.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["BF964057"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "94C4D48B", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` rule for the `lose` case correctly. It properly decrements the score and integrates with the rest of the scoring system. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "026B015E", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` rule for the `draw` case correctly. It maintains the score without changes and integrates well with the scoring system. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

Key points:
1. Only two code blocks need regeneration due to the "scissor"/"scissors" inconsistency
2. These two blocks (BF964057 and 58D60F5E) are interdependent
3. All other blocks are correct and don't need modification
4. The test result shows the logic works despite the typo, but fixing it would improve consistency
