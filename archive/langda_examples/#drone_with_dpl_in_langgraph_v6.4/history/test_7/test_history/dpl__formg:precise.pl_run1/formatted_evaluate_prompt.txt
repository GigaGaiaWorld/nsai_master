System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code aims to implement a merge sort algorithm. While the logic of the algorithm is conceptually correct, the implementation contains several issues, including syntax errors, missing predicates, and logical inconsistencies. The test results indicate a failure due to an undefined predicate `split_at/4`, which is critical for the algorithm's functionality. The code also lacks proper integration between its components, leading to runtime errors.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Undefined Predicate**: The predicate `split_at/4` is called but not defined, causing a runtime error.
2. **Incorrect Predicate Name**: The code defines `split_list/3` but calls `split_at/4`, leading to a mismatch.
3. **Logical Inconsistency**: The `split_list/3` predicate does not correctly split the list into two parts for recursive sorting.
4. **Syntax Issues**: The code contains minor syntax issues, such as misplaced commas and incomplete clauses.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "95E704F2",
        "Report": "This code block correctly implements the requirements for determining the length of the list and splitting it into two parts. However, it calls `split_at/4`, which is undefined. The logic for splitting the list is sound, but the predicate name must match the defined predicate (`split_list/3`)."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `merge/3` and `append/3` predicates are correctly implemented and handle the merging of sorted lists. However, the `split_list/3` predicate does not correctly split the list into two parts for recursive processing. The `append/3` predicate is redundant since it is already part of Prolog's standard library."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Define `split_at/4` or Rename Predicate**: Either define the `split_at/4` predicate or rename the call to `split_list/3` to match the existing predicate.
2. **Fix `split_list/3`**: Ensure the `split_list/3` predicate correctly splits the list into two parts for recursive sorting. For example:
   

3. **Remove Redundant `append/3`**: The `append/3` predicate is already part of Prolog's standard library and does not need to be redefined.
4. **Syntax Cleanup**: Ensure all clauses are properly terminated and commas are correctly placed.
5. **Test the Fixed Code**: After making the above changes, test the code with the provided query to verify correctness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
