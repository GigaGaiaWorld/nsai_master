Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The relevant code block from generated_code that replaces the <Langda> section is:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "length(List, Len),\n    Len > 1,\n    Half is Len // 2,\n    split_at(List, Half, Left, Right)"}
```

This matches:
1. The original HASH tag "95E704F2" from the <Langda> section
2. The requirements of getting length, recursive boundary check, and splitting the list
3. The corrected version that uses split_at instead of the flawed split_list implementation mentioned in the Report
