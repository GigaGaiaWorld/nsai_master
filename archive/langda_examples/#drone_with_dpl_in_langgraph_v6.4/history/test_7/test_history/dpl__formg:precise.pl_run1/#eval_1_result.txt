{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements for determining the length of the list and checking the recursive boundary. However, the `split_list` predicate is flawed. It incorrectly splits the list by creating a list `Left` of length `Half` and then appending the remaining elements to `Right`. This does not guarantee that the list is split into two halves. The correct approach would be to use `split_at(List, Half, Left, Right)` or similar logic to ensure the list is split into two parts of equal (or nearly equal) length.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Report": "This code block correctly implements the recursive calls to `merge_sort` for the left and right halves and merges the results using the `merge` predicate. The logic here is sound, but it relies on the correctness of the `split_list` predicate, which is currently flawed. If the splitting is fixed, this block will work as intended.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["95E704F2"]}
```

The first code block (HASH: 95E704F2) needs regeneration due to the incorrect implementation of the `split_list` predicate. The second code block (HASH: 26E82D5D) does not need regeneration as its logic is correct, but it depends on the corrected version of the first block to function properly.
