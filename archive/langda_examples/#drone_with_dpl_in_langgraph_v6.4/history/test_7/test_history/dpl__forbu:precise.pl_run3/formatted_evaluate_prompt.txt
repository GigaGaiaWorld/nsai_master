System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
 swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
 swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):-
 hole(H1,H2,X1,X2),
 bubble([X2|T],T1,X).
bubblesort([],L,L).
bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>

  bubblesort(L2,[X|L3],Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 2971FD2F </HASH>
<Requirements>Recursively call bubblesort on L2 and put the current maximum value X into the sorted part [X|L3]. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).

<Code_Block>swap(X,Y,swap):-
  X > Y.
swap(X,Y,no_swap):-
  X =< Y.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 5CBF7C6A </HASH>
<Requirements>The logical predicate that determines whether to exchange </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The code is syntactically valid and implements a basic bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog. The test result shows that the code correctly sorts the input list [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12] into [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12], indicating that the core logic works as intended. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and readability that could be improved." </Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> "No critical errors were found in the code. The test results confirm that the sorting logic is correct. However, the code could be optimized for clarity and completeness, such as ensuring all predicates are properly documented and the recursive logic is explicitly clear." </Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "2971FD2F",
        "Report": "The recursive call to `bubblesort` is correctly implemented, but the predicate could benefit from additional comments to clarify the role of `L2` and `L3` in the recursion. The current implementation meets the requirement of recursively calling `bubblesort` on `L2` and appending the current maximum `X` to the sorted part `[X|L3]`."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "5CBF7C6A",
        "Report": "The `swap` predicate is logically correct and adheres to the requirement of determining whether to exchange elements based on their values. However, the predicate names `swap` and `no_swap` could be more descriptive to reflect their purpose (e.g., `should_swap` and `should_not_swap`)."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>"1. Add comments to clarify the recursive logic in the `bubblesort` predicate. 2. Rename the `swap` and `no_swap` predicates to more descriptive names for better readability. 3. Consider adding edge-case tests (e.g., empty list, already sorted list) to ensure robustness. 4. Document the purpose of each predicate for future maintainability." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
