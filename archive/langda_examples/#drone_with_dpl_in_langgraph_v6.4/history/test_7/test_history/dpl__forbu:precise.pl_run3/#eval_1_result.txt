Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
  "HASH": "2971FD2F",
  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the recursive bubblesort logic as required. It properly calls bubble/3 to get the current maximum and recursively processes the remaining list. While functionally correct, it could benefit from: 1) Adding comments to explain the role of L2 (remaining unsorted list) and L3 (accumulator for sorted elements), 2) Better variable naming for clarity. The test results confirm it works as intended.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "5CBF7C6A",
  "Report": "The swap predicate correctly implements the comparison logic for bubble sort. It meets all requirements by properly determining when to swap elements. The only improvement needed is renaming the predicates to be more descriptive (e.g., 'should_swap' instead of 'swap', 'keep_order' instead of 'no_swap'). This is a readability enhancement rather than a functional requirement.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

Key points:
1. Neither code block needs regeneration as both are functionally correct and pass all tests
2. Both implementations fully satisfy their respective requirements
3. The suggested improvements are optional readability enhancements
4. There are no dependencies between these code blocks that would require coordinated regeneration
5. The test results confirm both components work correctly together in the sorting algorithm
