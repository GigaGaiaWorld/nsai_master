Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. The <Langda> section was about defining the game rules of rock-paper-scissors, which appears to be the basic move and beats predicates at the top of the code.

Here's the extracted code block in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E","Code": "move(rock).\nmove(paper).\nmove(scissor).\nbeats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(scissor, paper).\nbeats(paper, rock)."}
```

Note that this is the only code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code, as the other parts were already complete in the original code. The hash "CFA63C1E" was provided in the <Langda> section's <HASH> tag.
