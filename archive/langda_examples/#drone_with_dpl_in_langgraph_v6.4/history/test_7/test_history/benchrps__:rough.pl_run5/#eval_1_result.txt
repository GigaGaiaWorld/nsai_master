  "Report": "This code block defines the `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates but fails to define the `play/3` predicate, which is essential for generating the `Results` list. The test failure confirms this omission. The block needs regeneration to include the `play/3` predicate and ensure proper integration with the game rules. Additionally, edge cases (e.g., empty lists) should be handled.",
