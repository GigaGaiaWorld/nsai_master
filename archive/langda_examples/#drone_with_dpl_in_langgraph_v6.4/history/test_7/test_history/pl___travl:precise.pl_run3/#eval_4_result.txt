  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf(X)` predicate with four rules that correctly implement the specified probabilities for initial infection (0.1), contact transmission (0.6 for non-susceptible, 0.8 for susceptible), and travel risk (0.2). However, the test results show unexpectedly low probabilities (0.0316), indicating that the probabilities are not being aggregated correctly. ProbLog treats each rule as an independent event, so the final probability should account for all applicable rules. The issue is not with the individual rules but with how their probabilities combine.",
