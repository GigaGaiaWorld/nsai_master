  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with four rules that correctly implement the specified requirements for initial infection, contact transmission (both susceptible and non-susceptible cases), and travel risk. However, the test results show probabilities (0.0316) that are significantly lower than expected, indicating a problem in how these probabilities are combined or propagated. The issue appears to be in the logical combination of probabilities rather than in the individual rules themselves. The code block may need adjustments to ensure probabilities are combined additively or multiplicatively as required by the model's semantics.",
