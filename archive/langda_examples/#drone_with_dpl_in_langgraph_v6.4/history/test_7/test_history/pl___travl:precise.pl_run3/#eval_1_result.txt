  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate is incomplete and incorrect according to the requirements. It only implements the 0.6 infection probability for non-susceptible individuals through contact, but misses: (1) the 0.8 probability for susceptible individuals, (2) the 0.2 travel risk probability, and (3) integration with the `initialInf/1` predicate. The test result (0.0000 probability) confirms this implementation flaw. The predicate needs to be rewritten to combine all infection sources (initial, contact, travel) with their respective probabilities.",
