Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\n0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

Note that I've:
1. Used the same HASH value from the original code (E09B4F54)
2. Included the exact code block that was marked as <Code_Block> in the original
3. Maintained the escape character for the negation operator (\\+)
4. Formatted it as requested in JSON format with the "problog" language identifier

The additional rules in the generated code that combine probabilities are not part of the original <Langda> block, so I haven't included them in this extraction.
