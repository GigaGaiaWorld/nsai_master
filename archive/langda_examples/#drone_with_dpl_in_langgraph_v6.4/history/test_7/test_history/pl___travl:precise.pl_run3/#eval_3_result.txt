  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf(X)` predicate with four rules: initial infection, contact transmission (with and without susceptibility), and travel risk. The main issues are: 1) The probabilities are not being correctly aggregated (e.g., initial infection probability of 0.1 is not reflected in results), 2) The susceptibility logic (0.6 vs 0.8 difference) is not visible in results, and 3) The travel risk probability (0.2) is not properly combined. The test results (0.0316) are significantly lower than expected, indicating incorrect probability combination.",
