  "Report": "The `number/3` predicate currently accumulates digits from left to right, which contradicts the requirement to add the current number to the 'low bit' of the accumulated value (high bit on the right). This results in incorrect numerical values for the input lists. For example, `[img_7, img_9]` should yield 97, but the current implementation yields 79. The predicate needs to be regenerated to correctly accumulate digits in the specified order (high bit on the right). This can be achieved by reversing the list before processing or adjusting the accumulation logic.",
