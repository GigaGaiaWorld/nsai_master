{"HASH": "6579E7BA","Report": "The `number/3` predicate incorrectly accumulates digits by placing the new digit on the left side (`NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr`), which reverses the order of digits. For example, `[img_3, img_4]` should yield 34, but the current implementation yields 43. This is a logical error that violates the requirement to process digits from left to right. The predicate needs to be regenerated to correctly accumulate digits by placing the new digit on the right side (e.g., `NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr` should be replaced with logic that maintains digit order).","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is syntactically correct and logically sound, but its output depends on the flawed `number/3` predicate (HASH: 6579E7BA). Since the issue lies in the dependency (`number/3`), this block does not need regeneration itself. However, it will produce incorrect results until the `number/3` predicate is fixed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["6579E7BA"]}
