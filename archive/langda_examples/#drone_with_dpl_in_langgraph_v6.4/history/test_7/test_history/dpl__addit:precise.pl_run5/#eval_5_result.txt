  "Report": "The `number/3` predicate has several critical issues: (1) It uses an undefined `length/1` function, causing evaluation errors. (2) The accumulation logic is incorrect as it does not place the high bit on the right as required. (3) The recursive processing of the list is not properly implemented. The predicate needs to be regenerated to include a custom length calculation, correct bit placement, and proper recursion.",
