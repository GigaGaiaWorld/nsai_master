  "Report": "The `number/3` predicate recursively processes the list of images and accumulates the result. However, it incorrectly adds the current number to the 'high bit' (left side) of the accumulated value, contrary to the requirement of adding it to the 'low bit' (right side). The base case `number([], Result, Result).` is correct but could be more explicitly documented. The predicate needs to be regenerated to correctly implement the requirement of adding the current number to the 'low bit' of the accumulated value.",

  "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate is syntactically incomplete, missing a closing period. It also lacks error handling for cases where the input lists are not valid or the `number/2` predicate fails. This predicate depends on the correct implementation of the `number/3` predicate (HASH: 6579E7BA), which needs regeneration. Therefore, this predicate should also be regenerated after the `number/3` predicate is fixed.",
