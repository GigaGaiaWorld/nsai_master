  "Report": "The `number/3` predicate has critical issues: (1) It uses `length/1`, which is unsupported in ProbLog, causing evaluation errors. (2) The accumulation logic is flawedâ€”it incorrectly calculates digit positions by using `10^length(T)`, which doesn't align with the requirement to treat the high bit as the rightmost digit. (3) The predicate fails to properly accumulate the numerical value in the specified order (low bit addition with high bit on the right). Recommendations: (1) Replace `length/1` with iterative position tracking or reverse the list processing. (2) Restructure the accumulation to multiply by increasing powers of 10 (e.g., `NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr`). (3) Test with edge cases like empty lists or single-digit inputs.",
