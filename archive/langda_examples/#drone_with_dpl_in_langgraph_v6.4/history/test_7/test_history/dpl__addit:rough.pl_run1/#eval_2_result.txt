  "Report": "The `number` predicate is logically correct and meets the specified requirements for converting a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. It handles the base case (empty list) and recursive case correctly. However, it lacks comments for clarity and does not explicitly validate input image IDs against the `digit` facts. The test result confirms it works for valid inputs, but edge cases (e.g., invalid image IDs) are untested. No syntax or logical errors are present.",

{
  "HASH": "N/A (for the `multi_addition` predicate)",
  "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate correctly implements the addition logic using the `number` predicate and produces the expected result for valid inputs. However, it assumes valid inputs and lacks error handling for cases where `digit` facts are missing or inputs are malformed. While it does not need regeneration for core functionality, adding input validation would improve robustness.",
