System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>number([], 0).
number([H|T], N) :-
    digit(H, D),
    number(T, N1),
    N is N1 * 10 + D.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 06576BEB </HASH>
<Requirements>define number predicate, to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. </Requirements></Langda>
.
multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,X2),number(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],310) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values and perform addition. The test result confirms that the logic works correctly for the given example. However, there are minor issues and potential improvements to consider for robustness and clarity.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. The `digit` facts are not explicitly defined for all possible digits (e.g., `img_10` or other variations), which could lead to runtime errors if unexpected inputs are provided.
2. The `number` predicate does not handle edge cases, such as an empty list (though it is defined, it might not be intuitive for all users).
3. The `multi_addition` predicate assumes valid inputs and does not include error handling for invalid or missing `digit` facts.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "06576BEB",
        "Report": "The `digit` facts are correctly defined for digits 0-9, but the code lacks flexibility for other potential image IDs or digits. The `number` predicate is logically correct but could benefit from additional comments or edge-case handling for clarity."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for the `multi_addition` predicate)",
        "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate works as intended for valid inputs but does not account for invalid or missing `digit` facts. It would benefit from error handling or validation checks."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Expand the `digit` facts to include all possible image IDs or add validation logic to handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
2. Add comments to the `number` predicate to clarify its purpose and edge cases (e.g., empty list behavior).
3. Enhance the `multi_addition` predicate with error handling or validation to ensure robustness.
4. Consider adding unit tests for edge cases, such as empty lists or invalid image IDs, to verify the code's behavior under all conditions.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
