```report
{"HASH": "06576BEB","Report": "The `number` predicate correctly implements the logic for converting a list of image IDs to an integer, fulfilling the core requirement. However, it lacks error handling for edge cases (empty lists, invalid image IDs) and the `digit` facts it depends on are not properly enclosed in a ProbLog block. While functional, these structural issues warrant regeneration for robustness.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "N/A (multi_addition)","Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate works for valid inputs but assumes successful execution of `number`, which may fail. It should be regenerated to handle such cases (e.g., with validation or error propagation).","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["06576BEB"]}
```

**Notes:**  
- The `digit` facts (no hash provided) should be regenerated within a proper ProbLog block, but since they weren't tagged with a hash, they aren't included in the formal report.  
- Dependencies reflect that `multi_addition`'s regeneration is only meaningful if the `number` predicate (06576BEB) is also regenerated to ensure consistent error handling.
