Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "06576BEB", "Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :-\n    digit(H, D),\n    number(T, N1),\n    N is N1 * 10 + D."}
```

Note: While the generated code includes additional improvements (like comments and example usage), only the core `number` predicate implementation was requested since that was the part marked with <langda> in the original code. The hash value is preserved from the original report.
