System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
 swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
 swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):-
 hole(H1,H2,X1,X2),
 bubble([X2|T],T1,X).
bubblesort([],L,L).

.
 
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code is syntactically valid and implements a basic bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog. The test result shows that the code correctly sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating logical correctness for this specific case. However, the code lacks robustness and may not handle edge cases or larger lists efficiently. The integration between the `bubblesort` and `swap` predicates is functional but could be improved for clarity and maintainability.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Incomplete Base Case Handling**: The `bubblesort` predicate does not explicitly handle the case where the input list is already sorted, which could lead to unnecessary computations.
2. **Lack of Generalization**: The `swap` predicate assumes numerical comparisons (`X > Y` and `X =< Y`), which may not generalize to other data types without modification.
3. **Code Clarity**: The `hole` predicate's naming and structure are unconventional and could be confusing. Renaming it to something like `compare_and_swap` would improve readability.
4. **Performance**: The bubble sort algorithm is inherently inefficient for larger lists, and the current implementation does not include optimizations (e.g., early termination if no swaps occur in a pass).
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "2971FD2F",
        "Report": "The `bubblesort` predicate recursively calls itself to sort the list, but it lacks an explicit check for an already sorted list. This could lead to redundant passes. Additionally, the predicate name `forth_sort` is unconventional and could be renamed to `bubble_sort` for clarity."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "5CBF7C6A",
        "Report": "The `swap` predicate correctly implements the swapping logic based on numerical comparisons. However, it assumes numerical inputs and does not handle other data types. The predicate could be generalized or documented to clarify its intended use case."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Add Base Case Handling**: Modify the `bubblesort` predicate to terminate early if the list is already sorted.
2. **Generalize the `swap` Predicate**: Extend the `swap` predicate to handle other data types or document its limitations clearly.
3. **Improve Code Clarity**: Rename the `hole` predicate to `compare_and_swap` and `forth_sort` to `bubble_sort` for better readability.
4. **Optimize Performance**: Consider adding an early termination check in the `bubblesort` predicate to stop if no swaps occur during a pass.
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Include test cases for empty lists, single-element lists, and already sorted lists to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
