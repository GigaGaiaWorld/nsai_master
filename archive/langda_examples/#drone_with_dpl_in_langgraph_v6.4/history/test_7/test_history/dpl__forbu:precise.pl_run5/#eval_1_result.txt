  "Report": "The `bubblesort` predicate correctly implements the recursive sorting logic as required, but lacks optimization for already sorted lists and has unconventional naming (`forth_sort`). While it passes the given test case, improvements in efficiency and clarity are recommended. The core logic is functionally correct, so regeneration is not strictly necessary but would be beneficial for robustness.",

  "Report": "The `swap` predicate correctly implements the required comparison logic for numerical values, but is not generalized for other data types. It meets the current requirements but would need modification for broader use. Since the test passes and the requirements are fulfilled, regeneration is optional but recommended for future extensibility.",
