{"HASH": "FD850DEC","Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate for `draw` cases is correctly implemented as per the requirements. It handles the case where a draw does not affect the score by passing the previous round's score directly. However, this clause appears twice in the code (once in the main block and once in the `<Langda>` block), which is redundant. While this redundancy does not affect functionality, it should be cleaned up for clarity and maintainability.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7","Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate is logically correct and meets the requirements. It calls `play/3` to generate results and `compute_score/2` to calculate the score, then determines the winner based on the score. The test result confirms it works as expected. The only issue is minor formatting (could be improved for readability), but the logic is sound. No regeneration is needed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
