{"HASH": "A37F4273","Report": "The `query_pop` predicate correctly implements the logic to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1` effectively approximate the ratio `D1/D2 < 1.05` without using division or decimals. The predicate ensures that the same country is not compared with itself (`C1 \\= C2`). The test results validate the correctness of this implementation. No regeneration is needed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "3A3D0149","Report": "The `density` predicate correctly calculates the integer population density by multiplying the population by 100 and applying floor division by the area (`D is (P * 100) // A`). This aligns with the requirement to avoid floating-point arithmetic. The predicate relies on the `pop/2` and `area/2` facts, which are correctly defined in the database. The test results confirm that the density values are computed accurately. No regeneration is needed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
