Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "0C388A60", "Report": "The code block defines `move(paper).` correctly, fulfilling the requirement. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Report": "The code block defines `move(scissor).` with a typo. It should be `move(scissors).` for consistency with the rest of the code. This affects the logical correctness of the game rules.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["58D60F5E"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "59C3D0D4", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(paper, rock).` correctly, fulfilling the requirement. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(scissor, paper).` with a typo. It should be `beats(scissors, paper).` for consistency. This depends on the corrected `move(scissors).` definition.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["BF964057"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "94C4D48B", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` rule for the `lose` case correctly, decrementing the score. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "026B015E", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` rule for the `draw` case correctly, leaving the score unchanged. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```
