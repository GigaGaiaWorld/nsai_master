Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "766936E0", "Code": "team_strength([P,P2|L],G,S) :- strength(P,G,S1), team_strength([P2|L],G,S2), min(S1,S2,S)."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <langda> in the origin_code and completed in the generated_code. The JSON includes:
- The original HASH tag from the <langda> block
- The completed code snippet that replaced the <langda> placeholder
