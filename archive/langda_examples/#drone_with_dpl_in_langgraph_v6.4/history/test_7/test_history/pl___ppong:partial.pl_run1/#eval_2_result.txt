    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the `team_strength` predicate as per the requirements, calculating the team strength as the minimum of all members' strengths. The logic is syntactically and semantically correct. However, the first part of the code (outside this block) is incomplete, which could cause confusion. The test results align with the logic, showing plausible probabilities. No regeneration is needed for this block, but the surrounding code should be completed for clarity.",
