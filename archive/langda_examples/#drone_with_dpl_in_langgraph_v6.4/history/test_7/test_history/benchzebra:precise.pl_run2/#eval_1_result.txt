  "Report": "The code block defines the constraints for the zebra puzzle but relies on the `member/2` predicate, which is not defined in the provided code. The `my_member/2` predicate is defined but not used, suggesting a possible oversight in replacing `member/2` with `my_member/2`. The block also lacks validation for mutual exclusivity of attributes (e.g., no two houses can share the same color or nationality).",

  "Report": "The helper predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly implemented but are not integrated into the main logic due to the missing `member/2` predicate. The `my_member/2` predicate could replace `member/2` if properly referenced. No regeneration is needed for these predicates, but the main code block must be updated to use them.",
