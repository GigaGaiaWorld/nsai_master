Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. Here's the formatted JSON:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "play([], [], []).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-\n    (beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win;\n     beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose;\n     Result = draw),\n    play(P1s, P2s, Results)."}
```

This code defines the game rules for rock-paper-scissors by implementing the `play/3` predicate that takes two lists of moves and produces a list of results (win/lose/draw) based on the `beats/2` relationships defined earlier in the code.
