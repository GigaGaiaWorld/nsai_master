Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks that correspond to the <langda> blocks:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "play([], [], []).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-\n    (beats(P1, P2), Result = win;\n     beats(P2, P1), Result = lose;\n     Result = draw),\n    play(P1s, P2s, Results)."}
```

Note: There was only one <langda> block in the origin_code, so only one code block is extracted. The HASH value is taken from the <HASH> tag in the origin_code's <langda> section.
