  "Report": "The `play/3` predicate correctly implements the game rules but lacks handling for unequal list lengths. The `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags are not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed. The logic for determining wins, losses, and draws is correct and aligns with the requirements.
