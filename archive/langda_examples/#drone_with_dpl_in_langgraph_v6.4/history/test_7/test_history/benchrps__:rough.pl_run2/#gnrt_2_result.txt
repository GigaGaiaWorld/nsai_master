Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "play([], [], []).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-\n    (beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win;\n     beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose;\n     Result = draw),\n    play(P1s, P2s, Results)."}
```

Note that:
1. The code block corresponds to the play predicate that was marked with <Langda> in the origin_code
2. The HASH value is preserved from the original tag
3. The code has been updated in the generated version to use the -> operator instead of commas for better determinism
4. The formatting maintains the Prolog syntax while fitting the JSON structure
