Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "play([], [], []).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [win|Results]) :- beats(P1, P2), play(P1s, P2s, Results).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [lose|Results]) :- beats(P2, P1), play(P1s, P2s, Results).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [draw|Results]) :- P1 = P2, play(P1s, P2s, Results)."}
```

Note: The only code block that corresponds to a <langda> section in the origin_code is the `play/3` predicate definition. The other predicates (`compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3`) were already complete in the origin_code and weren't marked with <langda> tags.
