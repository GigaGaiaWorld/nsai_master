Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

 % Problog Inference Result：

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase implements the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors and calculates the game results. The test result shows that the code correctly identifies the winner as "player2" for the given moves, which aligns with the expected outcome. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and potential improvements for clarity and robustness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Issue**: The `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags are not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed.
2. **Logical Issue**: The `play/3` predicate does not handle cases where the input lists are of unequal lengths, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. **Clarity Issue**: The `compute_score/2` predicate could be simplified for better readability.
4. **Integration Issue**: The `determine_winner/3` predicate works correctly but could be optimized for performance.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "CFA63C1E",
        "Report": "The `play/3` predicate correctly implements the game rules but lacks handling for unequal list lengths. Additionally, the `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags are not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed. The logic for determining wins, losses, and draws is correct."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate works as intended but could be simplified. For example, the `draw` case could be merged into a single clause with the `lose` case since both decrement the score by 0. The `determine_winner/3` predicate integrates well with the other predicates but could benefit from additional checks for input validity."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Remove the `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags to ensure the code is syntactically valid.
2. Add input validation to handle cases where the move lists are of unequal lengths.
3. Simplify the `compute_score/2` predicate for better readability.
4. Optimize the `determine_winner/3` predicate by adding checks for input validity and edge cases.
5. Consider adding comments to explain the logic for future maintainability.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
