{"HASH": "CFA63C1E","Report": "The `play/3` predicate is incorrectly implemented. The `->` operator is not valid in this context, and the predicate lacks proper Prolog syntax. Additionally, the predicate does not handle edge cases, such as empty lists, correctly. The error message indicates that the system cannot find clauses for the predicate, which confirms the syntax issue.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates are logically correct but cannot be tested due to the failure of the `play/3` predicate. These predicates rely on the output of `play/3`, which is currently non-functional. No regeneration is needed for these predicates once `play/3` is fixed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["CFA63C1E"]}
