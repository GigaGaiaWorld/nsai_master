  "Report": "The `play/3` predicate correctly implements the game rules but has two main issues: (1) It uses `==` for equality comparison, which should be replaced with `=` for ProbLog compatibility. (2) It lacks input validation for moves, which could lead to runtime errors if invalid moves are provided. The predicate works correctly for valid inputs, as shown by the test case, but these improvements would make it more robust.",

  "Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score based on the game results but assumes all moves are valid. It would benefit from input validation to handle invalid moves gracefully. However, since it operates on the results of `play/3` (which should handle validation), regeneration is not strictly necessary if `play/3` is fixed.",
