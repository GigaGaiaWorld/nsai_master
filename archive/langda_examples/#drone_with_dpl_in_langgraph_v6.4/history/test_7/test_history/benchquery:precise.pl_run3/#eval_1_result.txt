  "Report": "The `query_pop` predicate correctly implements the logic for finding countries with approximately equal population densities. The inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1` effectively approximate the ratio `D1/D2 < 1.05`. However, the predicate could be optimized by removing the redundant `C1 \= C2` check, as the inequalities already ensure `C1` and `C2` are distinct. No regeneration is needed unless the `density` predicate is regenerated to use floating-point division, which would require adjustments to the inequalities.",

  "Report": "The `density` predicate calculates population density using floor division (`//`), which may introduce inaccuracies due to truncation. For more precise comparisons, floating-point division (`/`) could be used, though this would require adjusting the inequalities in `query_pop` to handle non-integer values. Regeneration is recommended to improve precision, but this would also require changes to the `query_pop` predicate (HASH: A37F4273).",
