Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<Langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "5CBF7C6A", "Code": "0.8::swap(X, Y, swap) :- X > Y.\n0.2::swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X > Y.\n1.0::swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X =< Y."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with `<Langda>` in the original code, and it has been properly formatted according to the ProbLog syntax in the generated code. The hash tag "5CBF7C6A" has been preserved from the original report.
