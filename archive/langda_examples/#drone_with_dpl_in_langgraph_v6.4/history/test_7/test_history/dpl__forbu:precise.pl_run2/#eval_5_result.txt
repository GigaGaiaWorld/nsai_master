  "Report": "The `swap` predicates in this code block are not exhaustive as they do not handle the case where `X = Y`. This could lead to incorrect probabilities or unexpected behavior during sorting. Additionally, the probabilities assigned (0.8 for swap and 0.2 for no_swap when `X > Y`) might not align with the intended sorting logic. The predicates should be revised to cover all cases and ensure logical consistency with the sorting algorithm.",
