System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
 swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
 swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):-
 hole(H1,H2,X1,X2),
 bubble([X2|T],T1,X).
bubblesort([],L,L).
bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :-
 

 bubble(L,L2,X),
 bubblesort(L2,[X|L3],Sorted).
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>0.8::swap(X, Y, swap) :- X > Y.
0.2::swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X > Y.
1.0::swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X =< Y.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 5CBF7C6A </HASH>
<Requirements>The logical predicate that determines whether to exchange </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]) = 0.2000
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 12]) = 0.2880
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 0.6400</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code aims to implement a probabilistic bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, where the sorting process is influenced by probabilistic swaps. The test results show that the algorithm produces different sorted lists with varying probabilities, which aligns with the probabilistic nature of the code. However, there are logical and syntactic issues that need to be addressed to ensure correctness and completeness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Error**: The `bubblesort` predicate is incomplete in the first code block, missing its body.
2. **Logical Error**: The `swap` predicates in the second code block do not cover all cases (e.g., when `X = Y`), which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. **Integration Issue**: The `hole` predicate in the first code block does not fully integrate with the probabilistic `swap` predicates, leading to potential inconsistencies in the sorting logic.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "5CBF7C6A",
        "Report": "The `bubblesort` predicate is incomplete, missing its body. This causes the predicate to fail during execution. Additionally, the `hole` predicate does not fully utilize the probabilistic `swap` predicates, which could lead to incorrect sorting behavior."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "5CBF7C6A",
        "Report": "The `swap` predicates are not exhaustive. For example, they do not handle the case where `X = Y`. This could lead to incorrect probabilities or unexpected behavior during sorting. The predicates should also be reviewed for logical consistency with the sorting algorithm."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Complete the `bubblesort` Predicate**: Ensure the `bubblesort` predicate has a complete body to properly handle the sorting logic.
2. **Revise the `swap` Predicates**: Make the `swap` predicates exhaustive by handling all cases (e.g., `X = Y`). Ensure the probabilities are correctly assigned to reflect the sorting requirements.
3. **Integrate `hole` with `swap`**: Ensure the `hole` predicate fully integrates with the probabilistic `swap` predicates to maintain consistency in the sorting logic.
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Test the code with edge cases, such as lists with duplicate elements or already sorted lists, to verify robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
