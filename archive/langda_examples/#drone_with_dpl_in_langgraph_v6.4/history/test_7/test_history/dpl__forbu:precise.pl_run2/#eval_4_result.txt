  "Report": "The `swap` predicate is incorrectly defined with probabilistic annotations. The current syntax `swap(X, Y, swap) :: 0.8 :- X > Y` is invalid in ProbLog, which expects the probability to come before the fact (`0.8::swap(X, Y, swap) :- X > Y`). Additionally, the logical conditions are not properly integrated with the probabilistic rules. This causes a grounding error during execution. The code block needs complete regeneration to follow ProbLog syntax rules and properly implement the probabilistic swapping logic.",
