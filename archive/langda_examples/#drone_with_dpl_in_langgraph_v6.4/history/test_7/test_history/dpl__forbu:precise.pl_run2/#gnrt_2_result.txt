Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <Langda> blocks:

```problog
{"HASH": "5CBF7C6A", "Code": "swap(X, Y, swap) :- X > Y.\nswap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X =< Y."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <Langda> in the origin_code, and it matches the corresponding implementation in the generated_code. The HASH value is taken directly from the <HASH> tag in the origin_code.
