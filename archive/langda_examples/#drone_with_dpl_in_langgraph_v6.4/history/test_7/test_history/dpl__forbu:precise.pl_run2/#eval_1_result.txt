{"HASH": "2971FD2F","Report": "The code block correctly implements the recursive call to `bubblesort` on `L2` and appends the current maximum value `X` to the sorted part `[X|L3]`, fulfilling the requirements. However, the initial code block before the `<Langda>` section is incomplete and misleading. The current implementation is logically correct and passes the test case, but the inconsistency in the initial code could cause confusion. No regeneration is needed for this block itself, but the initial code should be corrected to match this implementation.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "5CBF7C6A","Report": "The `swap` predicate is logically correct but could be optimized for clarity and performance. The `no_swap` case could be simplified to `swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X =< Y.` to avoid redundant checks. Additionally, the predicate lacks documentation, making it less clear for others to understand its role in the sorting process. Regeneration is recommended to improve clarity and add documentation.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
