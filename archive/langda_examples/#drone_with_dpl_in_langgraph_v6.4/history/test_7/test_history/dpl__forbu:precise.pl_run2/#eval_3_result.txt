{"HASH": "5CBF7C6A","Report": "The `swap` predicate is deterministic (`X > Y` or `X =< Y`), which does not align with ProbLog's probabilistic paradigm. It should be redefined to include probabilities (e.g., `swap(X, Y, swap) :: 0.8 :- X > Y.`). This change would better leverage ProbLog's capabilities and ensure consistency with probabilistic reasoning. The current implementation is syntactically correct but logically limited.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
