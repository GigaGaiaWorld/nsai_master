  "Report": "The `prove(implies(A, B))` predicate is correctly implemented and works as expected, as evidenced by the successful test result for `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))`. However, the other required predicates (`opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, and `refute/1`) are missing or not integrated into the `prove/1` logic. This code block does not need regeneration as it is functionally correct for its specific purpose, but the surrounding system needs additional implementations to meet all requirements.",
