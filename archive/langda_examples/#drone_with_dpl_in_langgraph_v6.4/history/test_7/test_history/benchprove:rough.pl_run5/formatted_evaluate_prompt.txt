System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
% member/2 for ProbLog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
% --------- Basic meta-interpreter ---------
% Prove "true" always succeeds
prove(true).
prove(Goal) :-
	% For all other goals, use the clause/2 facts/rules defined in the program
	clause(Goal, Body),
	prove(Body).
% Prove compound goal A,B: prove A first, then prove B
prove((A,B)) :-
	prove(A),
	prove(B).
% --------- Extended logic processing ---------
<Langda>
<Code_Block>prove(implies(A, B)) :-
	prove(A),
	prove(B).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: E553CC07 </HASH>
<Requirements>Extended logic processing of prove/1, which should contains: 	1.implies/2 	2.opposite/1 	3.expand/2 	4.includes/2 	5.extend/2 	6.refute/1 </Requirements></Langda>
.
% --------- Examples ---------- %
% Define some expand rules:
expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.
expand(square(X), Y) :- Y is X*X.
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, carol).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y).
% --------- Queries ---------- %
query(prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))).
query(prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))).
query(prove(expand(double(3),6))).
query(prove(includes([a,b,c],b))).
query(prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 1.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is partially functional but lacks complete implementation of the specified requirements. The test results indicate that only the `implies/2` predicate is correctly implemented, while the other predicates (`opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, and `refute/1`) are either missing or incorrectly implemented. The syntax is valid, but the logical correctness is compromised due to incomplete or missing predicates.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Missing Predicates**: The predicates `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, and `refute/1` are not implemented, leading to test failures.
2. **Incorrect Implementation**: The `expand/2` predicate is defined in the examples but not integrated into the `prove/1` logic, causing the test for `prove(expand(double(3),6))` to fail.
3. **Logical Gaps**: The `includes/2` and `extend/2` predicates are queried but not defined, resulting in test failures.
4. **Integration Issues**: The `prove/1` predicate does not handle the missing predicates, causing the test results to return `0.0000` for these cases.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "E553CC07",
        "Report": "The `prove(implies(A, B))` predicate is correctly implemented and works as expected, as evidenced by the successful test result for `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))`. However, the other required predicates (`opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, and `refute/1`) are missing or not integrated into the `prove/1` logic."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Implement Missing Predicates**: Define the missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, and `refute/1`) and integrate them into the `prove/1` logic.
2. **Correct `expand/2` Integration**: Ensure the `expand/2` predicate is properly integrated into the `prove/1` logic to handle queries like `prove(expand(double(3),6))`.
3. **Test Coverage**: Add test cases for the newly implemented predicates to verify their correctness.
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the purpose and usage of each predicate to avoid future confusion.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
