  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements for determining the length of the list and checking the recursive boundary. However, the `split_list` predicate is flawed. It does not correctly split the list into two halves. The current implementation uses `length(Left, Half)` and `append(Left, Right, List)`, which does not guarantee that `Left` contains the first `Half` elements of `List`. This can lead to incorrect sorting results for certain inputs. The block needs regeneration to fix the splitting logic.",
