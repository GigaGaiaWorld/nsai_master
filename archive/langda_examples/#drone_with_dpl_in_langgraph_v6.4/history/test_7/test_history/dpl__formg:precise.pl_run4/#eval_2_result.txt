```report
{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "This code block correctly implements the splitting logic for the merge sort algorithm. It calculates the length of the list, checks the recursive boundary condition (`Len > 1`), and splits the list into two halves (`Left` and `Right`). The logic is sound and meets the requirements. However, the same logic is duplicated in the unused `split_list` predicate, which is redundant. The block itself does not need regeneration, but the redundancy should be addressed by removing the `split_list` predicate.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A (for `split_list` predicate)","Report": "The `split_list` predicate is redundant because its functionality is already included in the `merge_sort` predicate. This duplication could lead to maintenance issues and confusion. This predicate should be removed entirely, as it adds no value to the implementation.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "N/A (for `append` predicate)","Report": "The `append` predicate is unnecessary for this implementation, as the splitting logic in `merge_sort` already uses `append` directly. This adds no value and could be removed to simplify the code.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
