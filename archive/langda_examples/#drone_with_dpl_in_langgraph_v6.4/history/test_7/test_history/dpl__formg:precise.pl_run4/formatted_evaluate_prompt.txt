System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test result shows that it correctly sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the given test case. However, there are minor issues and redundancies that could be improved for better clarity and efficiency.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Redundant Code Block**: The `split_list` predicate is defined but not used in the main `merge_sort` predicate. Instead, the splitting logic is duplicated in the `merge_sort` predicate.
2. **Unnecessary Predicate**: The `append` predicate is defined but not necessary for the merge sort implementation, as the splitting logic is handled by `length` and `append` directly in the `merge_sort` predicate.
3. **Code Duplication**: The splitting logic is repeated in both the `merge_sort` predicate and the unused `split_list` predicate.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "95E704F2",
        "Report": "This code block correctly implements the splitting logic for the merge sort algorithm. It calculates the length of the list, splits it into two halves (`Left` and `Right`), and ensures the recursive boundary condition (`Len > 1`). However, the same logic is duplicated in the unused `split_list` predicate, which is redundant."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for `split_list` predicate)",
        "Report": "The `split_list` predicate is redundant because its functionality is already included in the `merge_sort` predicate. This duplication could lead to maintenance issues and confusion."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for `append` predicate)",
        "Report": "The `append` predicate is unnecessary for this implementation, as the splitting logic in `merge_sort` already uses `append` directly. This adds no value and could be removed."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Remove Redundant Predicates**: Eliminate the `split_list` and `append` predicates, as their functionality is either duplicated or unnecessary.
2. **Simplify the Code**: Consolidate the splitting logic within the `merge_sort` predicate to avoid duplication.
3. **Add Comments**: Include comments to clarify the purpose of each part of the code, especially the recursive boundary conditions and merging logic.
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure the code works for edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element, even though the test case provided is successful.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
