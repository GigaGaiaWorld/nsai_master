Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. The <Langda> section in the origin_code is replaced by a more complete implementation in the generated_code.

Here's the extracted and formatted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "length(List, Len),\n    Len > 1,\n    Half is Len // 2,\n    length(Left, Half),\n    append(Left, Right, List)"}
```

This corresponds to the improved version of the code block that was marked with the hash "95E704F2" in the origin_code. The generated version includes the correct splitting logic with `Half is Len // 2` and maintains all the required functionality from the requirements (getting length, recursive boundary check, and proper list splitting).
