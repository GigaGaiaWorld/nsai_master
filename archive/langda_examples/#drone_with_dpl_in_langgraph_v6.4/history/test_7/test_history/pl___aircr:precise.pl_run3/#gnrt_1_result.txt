Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "5BCD04E8", "Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n    Time > 0,\n    Prev is Time-1,\n    flap_position(Prev,Old),\n    goal(G),\n    Old \\= G,\n    use_actuator(Time,A),\n    actuator_strength(A,AS),\n    (G > Old, Sign is 1 ; G < Old, Sign is -1),\n    AE is Sign * AS,\n    wind_effect(Time,WE),\n    Pos is Old + AE + WE."}
```

Note that:
1. I've used the same HASH value from the original `<Langda>` block
2. The code is formatted exactly as it appears in the generated code
3. I've preserved all the logic and structure of the original implementation
4. Special characters like `\=` have been properly escaped in the JSON format
