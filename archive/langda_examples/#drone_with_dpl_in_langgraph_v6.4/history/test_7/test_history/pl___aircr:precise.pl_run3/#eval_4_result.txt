  "Report": "The code block implements the core logic for calculating the attempted flap position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and current position. While syntactically correct and functionally aligned with requirements, it exhibits suboptimal performance in goal achievement (low probabilities in test results). Key issues include: (1) Wind effect (`WE`) is added directly without mitigation, which can counteract actuator movement (`AE`), (2) No prioritization of the stronger actuator (`a`) when the goal is distant, and (3) Conservative movement due to strict legality checks. The logic should be enhanced to dynamically adjust for wind and actuator selection.",
