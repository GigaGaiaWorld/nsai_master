  "Report": "The code block contains a critical syntax error due to the use of the unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog. The logic attempts to conditionally assign `Pos` based on whether `TempPos` is a legal flap position, but this implementation is invalid in ProbLog. The requirements are correctly implemented otherwise, including actuator selection, wind effect calculation, and position adjustment. The block needs regeneration to replace the `->` operator with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., using `(legal_flap_position(TempPos), Pos = TempPos ; Pos = Old)`).",
