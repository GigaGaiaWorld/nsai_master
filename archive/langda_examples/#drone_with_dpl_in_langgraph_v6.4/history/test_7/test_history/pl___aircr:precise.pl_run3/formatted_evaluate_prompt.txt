<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The code is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements for the aircraft flap controller. The test results show that the probability of reaching the goal (`goal_reached`) increases over time, which aligns with the expected behavior of the system. However, the probability values seem lower than expected, indicating potential inefficiencies or suboptimal logic in the movement calculation. The absence of `overrun_exception` events suggests that the system correctly handles illegal flap positions, which is a positive outcome.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Suboptimal Goal Achievement**: The probabilities for `goal_reached` are lower than expected, suggesting that the system may not be efficiently moving toward the goal position.
2. **Wind Effect Calculation**: The wind effect might not be fully integrated into the movement logic, leading to less effective adjustments.
3. **Actuator Selection**: The random selection of actuators (a or b) may not always lead to the most efficient movement, especially since actuator `a` has higher strength.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "5BCD04E8",
        "Report": "The code block calculates the attempted flap position based on the actuator strength, wind effect, and current position. However, the logic for adjusting the position (`TempPos is Old + AE + WE`) may not always lead to the most efficient movement toward the goal. Specifically:
- The wind effect (`WE`) is added directly, which could counteract the actuator's movement (`AE`), especially if the wind is strong.
- The system does not prioritize the stronger actuator (`a`) when the goal is far, which could delay reaching the target.
- The condition `(legal_flap_position(TempPos), Pos = TempPos ; Pos = Old)` ensures no overrun but may result in conservative movements."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Optimize Actuator Selection**: Introduce a bias toward the stronger actuator (`a`) when the distance to the goal is large, ensuring faster progress.
2. **Adjust Wind Effect Integration**: Modify the wind effect calculation to minimize its counteracting impact on the actuator's movement. For example, scale the wind effect based on the actuator's strength.
3. **Dynamic Movement Strategy**: Implement a more dynamic strategy for calculating `TempPos`, such as adjusting the step size based on the remaining distance to the goal.
4. **Testing and Tuning**: Experiment with different probabilities for actuator selection and wind effects to find an optimal balance for faster goal achievement.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
