  "Report": "The code block calculates the attempted flap position (`Pos`) by combining the previous position (`Old`), actuator strength (`AS`), and wind effect (`WE`). The arithmetic operation `Pos is Old + AE + WE` does not account for cases where `Pos` exceeds the legal range (0-10), leading to overrun exceptions. The wind effect (`WE`) can be too large, especially for strong winds, causing invalid positions. The logic for calculating `AE` (ideal movement) is correct, but the integration with wind effects needs refinement. Recommendations include clamping `Pos` within the legal range, adjusting wind effect probabilities, and optimizing actuator selection.",
