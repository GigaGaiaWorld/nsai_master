{"HASH": "A37F4273","Report": "The `query_pop` predicate correctly implements the logic to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population density. The inequalities (20×D1 < 21×D2 and 20×D2 < 21×D1) effectively approximate the ratio D1/D2 < 1.05 without using division or decimals. The test results validate this logic. No issues were found, and the implementation fully meets the requirements.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "3A3D0149","Report": "The `density` predicate accurately calculates the integer population density by multiplying the population by 100 and performing floor division by the area. This aligns with the requirements and ensures the density values are integers, which is necessary for the inequalities in `query_pop` to work correctly. The test results confirm the correctness of this implementation. No regeneration is needed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
