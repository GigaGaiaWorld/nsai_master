Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "7E335295", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world c, ensuring whale 1 is at position b. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "10EB99E1", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world c, ensuring whale 2 is at position c. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "A0236B75", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world c, ensuring whale 2 is male (bull). No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "459D5246", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world c, ensuring whale 3 is female (cow). No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "FA3ABC35", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world d, ensuring whale 1 is at position b. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "E19272CE", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world d, ensuring whale 2 is at position c. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "1C6CAA4A", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world d, ensuring whale 2 is male (bull). No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "7C3E979C", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirement for world d, ensuring whale 3 is male (bull). No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "F46C6231", "Report": "The code block defines a uniform distribution over worlds, but it is repeated in the code. This redundancy should be avoided. The block itself is correct but should be the only instance of this definition.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": []}
```

Key observations:
1. All code blocks except the last one (F46C6231) are correct and don't need regeneration.
2. The last block (F46C6231) needs regeneration only to remove redundancy - the logic itself is correct.
3. There are no dependencies between blocks that require regeneration.
4. The test results confirm the logical correctness of all implementations.
