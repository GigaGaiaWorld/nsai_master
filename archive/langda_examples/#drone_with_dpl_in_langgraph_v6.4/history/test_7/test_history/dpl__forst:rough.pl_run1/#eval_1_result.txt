  "Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete due to the missing `insertion_sort` predicate. Additionally, the `get_top_n` predicate does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than `N` elements, which could cause failures. The lack of test queries for this operation further obscures its reliability. This block needs regeneration to address these issues and fully implement the requirements for stack operations.",
