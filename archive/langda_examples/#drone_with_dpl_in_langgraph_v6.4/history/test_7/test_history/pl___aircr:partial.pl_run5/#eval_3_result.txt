  "Report": "The `goal_reached` predicate is incomplete and lacks logic to track progress or adjust probabilities based on proximity to the goal. The placeholder comment indicates this was intended but not implemented. The decreasing probabilities in the test results suggest this is a critical issue. The predicate should be enhanced to include conditions that check the distance to the goal and adjust probabilities accordingly. This would improve the system's ability to reach the goal over time.",
