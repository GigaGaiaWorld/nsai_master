  "Report": "The `goal_reached` predicate in this code block uses the unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog, which is causing the `UnknownClause` error. The logic for checking the goal condition is also overly complex. The predicate should be rewritten to use supported ProbLog constructs, such as `(Condition, Then ; Else)` instead of `->`. Additionally, the distance calculation logic could be simplified to improve readability and maintainability. The current implementation does not meet the requirement of determining if the goal is reached due to the syntax error.",
