<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The code is intended to model an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, such as actuator selection and wind effects. However, the test results indicate a critical syntax error related to an undefined clause (`''->'/2'`). The logical flow of the code appears to be partially implemented, but the error prevents it from executing correctly. The integration between predicates like `goal_reached` and `attempted_flap_position` is also problematic due to the syntax issue.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Error**: The error `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 35:18` suggests that the code uses an unsupported control predicate (`->`) in ProbLog. This is not allowed in ProbLog's syntax.
2. **Logical Gap**: The `goal_reached` predicate uses an unsupported `->` operator, which breaks the logical flow of determining whether the goal is reached.
3. **Integration Issue**: The predicates `goal_reached` and `attempted_flap_position` are not properly integrated due to the syntax error, preventing the code from functioning as intended.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "779B4ADF",
        "Report": "The `goal_reached` predicate uses the unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog. This operator is not part of ProbLog's syntax, leading to the `UnknownClause` error. Additionally, the predicate's logic for checking the goal condition is overly complex and could be simplified using supported ProbLog constructs."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace `->` Operator**: Replace the unsupported `->` operator in the `goal_reached` predicate with a supported ProbLog construct, such as `if-then-else` using `(Condition, Then ; Else)`.
2. **Simplify Logic**: Simplify the `goal_reached` predicate to avoid nested conditions and ensure it adheres to ProbLog's syntax rules.
3. **Test Incrementally**: After fixing the syntax, test each predicate (`goal_reached`, `attempted_flap_position`) individually to ensure they work as intended before integrating them.
4. **Documentation Review**: Refer to ProbLog's official documentation for supported control predicates and syntax to avoid similar issues in the future.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
