  "Report": "The `goal_reached` predicate is incomplete and lacks dynamic logic to track progress or adjust probabilities based on proximity to the goal. This is evident from the declining probabilities in the test results. The current implementation only checks if the flap position matches the goal without considering intermediate progress or adjusting probabilities. This could lead to suboptimal performance in the model. The predicate should be enhanced to include conditions that track distance reduction or other progress metrics toward the goal.",
