Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. Here's the JSON formatted output:

```problog
{"HASH": "779B4ADF", "Code": "goal_reached(Time) :-\n  flap_position(Time,Pos),\n  goal(Pos),\n  % Additional logic to track progress or adjust probabilities based on proximity to the goal\n  % For example, you could add a condition to check if the current position is closer to the goal than the previous one\n  % or adjust the probability of reaching the goal based on the distance to the goal.\n  % This is a placeholder for the additional logic.\n  true."}
