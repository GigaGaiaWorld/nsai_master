  "Report": "The `goal_reached` predicate is incomplete and lacks logic to track progress toward the goal or adjust probabilities based on proximity. This is evident from the decreasing probabilities in the test results, which suggest the system is not effectively moving closer to the goal over time. The placeholder comment indicates the need for additional logic, such as checking if the current position is closer to the goal than the previous one or adjusting probabilities based on distance to the goal. This missing functionality is critical for accurate goal tracking and system performance evaluation.",
