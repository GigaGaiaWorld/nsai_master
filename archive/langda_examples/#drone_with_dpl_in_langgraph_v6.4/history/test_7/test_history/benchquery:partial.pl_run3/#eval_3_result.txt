  "Report": "The `<Langda>` block contains a redundant `<Code_Block>` for `pop(w_germany, 620)`, which is already present in the main code. This redundancy could lead to maintenance issues and confusion. The block is not clearly integrated into the main code, which could cause it to be overlooked during updates. However, the test results show that the population data for `w_germany` is correctly used in the calculations, indicating that the functionality is not affected. The requirements for this block are met, but the implementation could be improved by removing the redundancy and ensuring clear integration.",
