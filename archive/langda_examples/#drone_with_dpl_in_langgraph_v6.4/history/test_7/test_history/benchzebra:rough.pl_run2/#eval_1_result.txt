  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and lacks proper integration with the rest of the code. It contains several logical constraints for the zebra puzzle but does not terminate properly or integrate seamlessly with the `zebra` predicate. The `houses` predicate is defined but not used correctly, leading to potential logical inconsistencies. Additionally, the timeout error suggests inefficiency or infinite loops in the predicate implementations. The block needs to be regenerated to ensure proper syntax, logical correctness, and efficient execution.",
