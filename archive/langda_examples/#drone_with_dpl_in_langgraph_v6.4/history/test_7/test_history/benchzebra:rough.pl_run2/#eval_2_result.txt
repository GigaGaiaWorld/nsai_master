  "Report": "The code block is syntactically correct and logically implements the Zebra Puzzle constraints. However, it contains redundant constraints (e.g., `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is repeated). The `houses` predicate is defined but not fully integrated into the constraints, leading to potential inefficiencies. Recommendations include removing redundancies, enhancing the `houses` predicate, improving variable naming, and optimizing constraints.",
