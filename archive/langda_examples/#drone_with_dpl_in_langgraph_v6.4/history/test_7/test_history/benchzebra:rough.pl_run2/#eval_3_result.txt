  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks some of the necessary constraints for solving the zebra puzzle. For example, it does not fully define the relationships between all house attributes (e.g., color, nationality, drink, etc.). Additionally, the `next_to` and `my_member` predicates are defined but may not be inefficient, contributing to the timeout. The block also misses constraints like the Norwegian living in the first house and the exact positioning of the blue house. These gaps prevent the solver from finding a solution efficiently.",
