Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),
    Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _,_],
    Houses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)|_],
    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,chesterfields), house(_,_,fox,_,_), Houses),
    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,kools), house(_,_,horse,_,_), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),
    next_to(house(_,norwegian,_,_,_), house(blue,_,_,_,_), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)."}
```

Note that this is the exact same code block that was originally in the <Langda> section, as the generated_code didn't actually add any new constraints or modify this block - it just incorporated it into the complete predicate definition. The hash (0F506A43) matches the one provided in the original <Langda> section.
