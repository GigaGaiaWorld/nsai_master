  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the `number` predicate to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. It handles the basic case correctly as evidenced by the successful test result. However, it lacks error handling for edge cases like empty lists or invalid image IDs. The digit facts are correctly defined but not properly enclosed in a ProbLog program block, which could cause issues in larger programs. The logic is sound but could be made more robust.",

  "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate works correctly for valid inputs as shown in the test case. However, it assumes valid inputs and doesn't handle potential failures from the `number` predicate. It should be enhanced to handle error cases gracefully. While it doesn't strictly need regeneration, it would benefit from improved robustness.",
