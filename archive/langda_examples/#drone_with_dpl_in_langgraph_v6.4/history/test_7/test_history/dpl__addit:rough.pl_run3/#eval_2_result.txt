  "Report": "The `number` predicate correctly implements the logic for converting a list of image IDs to an integer, fulfilling the core requirement. However, it lacks error handling for edge cases (empty lists, invalid image IDs) and the digit facts aren't properly enclosed in a ProbLog block. While the current implementation works for valid inputs, regeneration is recommended to improve robustness and proper ProbLog structure.",

  "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate works correctly for valid inputs as shown in the test case, but it assumes valid inputs and doesn't handle potential failures from the `number` predicate. Since it depends on the `number` predicate which needs regeneration, this should also be regenerated to include proper error handling and maintain consistency.",
