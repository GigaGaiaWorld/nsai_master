  "Report": "The `number` predicate is correctly implemented to convert a list of image IDs to an integer. The base case `number([], 0).` assumes an empty list corresponds to the integer 0, which might not always be the desired behavior. Additionally, the predicate lacks error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., unrecognized image IDs). While the current implementation works for the given test case, it could be improved for robustness and clarity. No regeneration is strictly necessary, but it would be beneficial to address these potential issues.",

  "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate is correctly implemented and works as expected, as confirmed by the test result. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the input lists contain invalid image IDs or are empty. While the current implementation is functionally correct, regeneration with added input validation would improve robustness. This block depends on the `number` predicate (HASH: 06576BEB), but since that doesn't need regeneration, this can be considered independently.",
