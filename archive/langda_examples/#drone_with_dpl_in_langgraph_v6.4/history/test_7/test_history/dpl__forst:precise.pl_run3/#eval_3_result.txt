  "Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete. The code checks if the stack has at least three elements and extracts the top three, but the sorting logic is missing. The `sort([A,B,C], [X,Y,Z])` predicate is not implemented, and the sorted elements are not correctly reintegrated into the stack. Additionally, the fallback for stacks with fewer than three elements is correctly handled. The test results do not include a query for the `sort` operation, making it impossible to verify its correctness. Recommendations: 1) Implement the sorting logic using the built-in `sort/2` predicate. 2) Add a test case for the `sort` operation. 3) Ensure edge cases (stacks with fewer than three elements) are handled as currently implemented.",
