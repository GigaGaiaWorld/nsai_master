Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    (   length(Stack, L), L >= 3\n    ->  get_top_n(Stack, 3, [A,B,C], Rest),\n        sort([A,B,C], [X,Y,Z]),\n        append([X,Y,Z], Rest, SortedStack)\n    ;   SortedStack = Stack\n    )."}
```

This JSON object contains:
- The original HASH value from the <langda> block
- The completed code snippet that implements the stack sort operation with proper edge case handling (checking if stack has at least 3 elements)
