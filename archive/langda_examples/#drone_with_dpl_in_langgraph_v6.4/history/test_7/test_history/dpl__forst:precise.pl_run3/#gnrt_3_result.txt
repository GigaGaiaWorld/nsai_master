Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    (   length(Stack, L), L >= 3\n    ->  get_top_n(Stack, 3, [A,B,C], Rest),\n        sort([A,B,C], SortedTop),\n        append(SortedTop, Rest, SortedStack)\n    ;   SortedStack = Stack\n    )."}
```

This JSON object contains:
- The original HASH tag from the `<langda>` block
- The completed code snippet that implements the `sort` operation for the stack, which:
  - Checks if the stack has at least 3 elements
  - Extracts the top 3 elements
  - Sorts them using Prolog's built-in `sort/2` predicate
  - Recombines them with the rest of the stack
  - Handles the case when the stack has fewer than 3 elements
