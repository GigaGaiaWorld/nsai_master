Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    (   length(Stack, L), L >= 3\n    ->  get_top_n(Stack, 3, [A,B,C], Rest),\n        sort([A,B,C], [X,Y,Z]),\n        append([X,Y,Z], Rest, SortedStack)\n    ;   SortedStack = Stack\n    )."}
```

This JSON object contains:
1. The HASH value from the original report ("6931D64E")
2. The completed code snippet that implements the `sort` operation for the stack, which was the missing part in the original code
