System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).
stack_op(pop, [_|Stack], Stack).
stack_op(dup, [X|Stack], [X,X|Stack]).
stack_op(swap, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X|Stack]).
stack_op(over, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X,Y|Stack]).
stack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Stack], [Z,X,Y|Stack]).

query(stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],[1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],[3, 1, 2, 4]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase implements a stack with various operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`). The test results show that all operations except `sort` work as expected. The `sort` operation is partially implemented but lacks a complete definition, leading to potential logical errors. The rest of the code is syntactically correct and logically sound for the tested operations.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Incomplete `sort` Operation**: The `sort` operation is not fully implemented, as the predicate `stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)` is missing its body. The placeholder suggests sorting the top three elements, but the logic is incomplete.
2. **Missing Test for `sort` Operation**: The test results do not include a query for the `sort` operation, making it impossible to verify its correctness.
3. **Potential Logical Error in `sort`**: The commented-out logic for `sort` suggests sorting the top three elements, but it does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than three elements gracefully.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6931D64E",
        "Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete. The predicate `stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)` is missing its body. The commented-out logic suggests sorting the top three elements, but it is not integrated into the code. Additionally, the logic does not handle stacks with fewer than three elements, which could lead to runtime errors."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Complete the `sort` Operation**: Implement the body of the `stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)` predicate. Ensure it sorts the top three elements and handles cases where the stack has fewer than three elements.
2. **Add Test Cases for `sort`**: Include test queries for the `sort` operation to verify its correctness. For example:
   - `query(stack_op(sort, [3, 1, 2, 4], Y)).` should return `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - `query(stack_op(sort, [1, 2], Y)).` should return `Y = [1, 2]` (no change).
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure the `sort` operation gracefully handles edge cases, such as empty stacks or stacks with fewer than three elements.
4. **Document the Code**: Add comments to clarify the logic, especially for the `sort` operation, to improve maintainability.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
