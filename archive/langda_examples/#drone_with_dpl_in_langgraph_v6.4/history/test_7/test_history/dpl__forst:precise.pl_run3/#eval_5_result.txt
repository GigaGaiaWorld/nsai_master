  "Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete. The predicate `stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)` is missing its body. The commented-out logic suggests sorting the top three elements, but it is not integrated into the code. Additionally, the logic does not handle stacks with fewer than three elements, which could lead to runtime errors. The requirements specify that the `sort` operation should sort the three elements at the top of the stack in ascending order and put them back to the original stack. This functionality is not fully implemented.",
