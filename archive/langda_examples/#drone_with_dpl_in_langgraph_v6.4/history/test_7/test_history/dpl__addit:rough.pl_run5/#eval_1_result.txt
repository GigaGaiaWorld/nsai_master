  "Report": "The `number` predicate is logically correct and fulfills the basic requirements of converting a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. However, it lacks error handling for edge cases (empty lists, invalid image IDs) and could benefit from being enclosed in a proper ProbLog program block for better scoping. The predicate works correctly as evidenced by the test results, so regeneration isn't strictly necessary but would be recommended for robustness.",
