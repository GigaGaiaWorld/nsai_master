```report
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7","Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate is logically correct but contains a syntax error ('Ambiguous token role'). The issue likely stems from incorrect formatting or misplaced tokens (e.g., commas/semicolons) in the predicate body or the query. The predicate depends on `play/3` and `compute_score/2`, but these are not the root cause of the error. Regeneration is needed to fix the syntax.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
