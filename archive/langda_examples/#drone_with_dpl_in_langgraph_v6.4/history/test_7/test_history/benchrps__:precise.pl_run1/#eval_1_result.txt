Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "3F277A35","Report": "The rule correctly implements that same gestures result in a draw. It properly checks that X is a valid move before declaring a draw. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "D91BB7A0","Report": "The rule correctly implements that X wins when X beats Y. It properly uses the beats/2 predicate to determine the winner. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0940BB04","Report": "The rule correctly implements that X loses when Y beats X. It properly uses the beats/2 predicate in reverse to determine the loser. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "583E41B6","Report": "The rule correctly adds 1 point for a win by recursively calculating the score. The implementation matches the requirements perfectly. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "D324979D","Report": "The rule correctly subtracts 1 point for a loss by recursively calculating the score. The implementation matches the requirements perfectly. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "FD850DEC","Report": "The rule correctly handles draws without changing the score. However, this exact rule appears twice in the code (duplicate). While functionally correct, the duplicate should be removed.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7","Report": "The predicate correctly calculates the winner based on the score, but contains redundant code (repeated compute_score call and an extra comma). The logic is correct but needs cleanup.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

The main issues found were:
1. A duplicate compute_score rule for draws (FD850DEC)
2. Redundant code in the determine_winner predicate (3FEB17D7)

All other code blocks are functioning correctly and don't need regeneration. The dependencies between blocks are minimal as each rule operates independently once the basic move/1 and beats/2 facts are established.
