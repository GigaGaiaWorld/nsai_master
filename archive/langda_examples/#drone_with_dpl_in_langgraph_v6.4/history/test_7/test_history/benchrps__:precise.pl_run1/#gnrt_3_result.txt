Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- \n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, S),\n    ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n    ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n    ; Winner = draw\n    )."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with `<langda>` in the original code, and it has been properly completed in the generated code. The JSON includes the hash from the original code and the completed implementation of the `determine_winner` predicate.
