  "Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate is intended to calculate the winner by comparing the results of each round and computing the score. The logic inside the predicate is correct, but the syntax is problematic, leading to a parsing error. The predicate should be properly formatted and terminated to match ProbLog's requirements. Additionally, the query at the end of the code is not properly formatted, which may contribute to the parsing error. The predicate should be regenerated to fix these syntax issues and ensure proper integration with the rest of the code.",
