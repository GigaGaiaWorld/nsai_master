Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- \n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, S),\n    ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n    ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n    ; Winner = draw\n    )."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <langda> in the origin_code and was completed in the generated_code. The JSON includes the hash from the original code and the completed implementation of the determine_winner predicate.
