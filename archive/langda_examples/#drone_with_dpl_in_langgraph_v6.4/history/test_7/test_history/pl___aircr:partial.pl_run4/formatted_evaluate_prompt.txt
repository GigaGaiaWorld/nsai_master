System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>

        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The code is intended to model an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, such as actuator selection and wind effects. However, the test results indicate a critical syntax error related to an undefined predicate or clause. The logical flow of the code seems plausible, but the implementation contains issues that prevent it from executing correctly.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Error**: The error message indicates an issue with an undefined clause (`''->'/2'` at line 41:18). This suggests a problem with the `->` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog.
2. **Logical Error**: The `cumulative_effect` predicate uses the `->` operator, which is not valid in ProbLog. This disrupts the logical flow of the `goal_reached` predicate.
3. **Integration Issue**: The `cumulative_effect` predicate is not properly integrated with the rest of the code due to the unsupported operator.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "779B4ADF",
        "Report": "The `cumulative_effect` predicate uses the `->` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog. This causes the `goal_reached` predicate to fail. Additionally, the predicate lacks proper handling of the cumulative positioning behavior, as it does not account for all possible cases."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace `->` Operator**: Replace the `->` operator in the `cumulative_effect` predicate with a supported alternative, such as `(Pos =:= OldPos, true) ; (Pos =\= OldPos, cumulative_effect(Prev, OldPos))`.
2. **Validate Predicates**: Ensure all predicates used in the code are supported by ProbLog. Refer to the ProbLog documentation for a list of supported operators and predicates.
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test each predicate individually to identify and fix issues before integrating them into the larger model.
4. **Documentation Review**: Review the ProbLog documentation to confirm the correct syntax for control predicates and logical constructs.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
