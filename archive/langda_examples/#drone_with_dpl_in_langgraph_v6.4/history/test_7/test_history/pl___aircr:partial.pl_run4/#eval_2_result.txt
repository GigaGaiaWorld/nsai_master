  "Report": "The code block contains a critical syntax error due to the use of the `->` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog. This operator is used in the `cumulative_effect` predicate, causing the `goal_reached` predicate to fail. Additionally, the predicate does not fully implement the cumulative positioning behavior as intended. The logical flow is disrupted, and the predicate lacks proper handling of all cases. Recommendations include replacing the `->` operator with supported alternatives (e.g., `(Pos =:= OldPos, true) ; (Pos =\= OldPos, cumulative_effect(Prev, OldPos))`), validating all predicates against ProbLog's supported syntax, and testing incrementally to ensure correct integration.",
