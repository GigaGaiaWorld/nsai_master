  "Report": "The code block for 'attempted_flap_position' contains a critical syntax error related to the conditional operator '->'. The error message indicates the ProbLog interpreter cannot resolve this clause, likely due to improper use of the conditional operator or missing predicate definitions. The logical flow matches requirements (calculating actuator movement, wind effects, and position validation), but the syntax prevents execution. The conditional check for 'legal_flap_position(Pos)' needs correction to comply with ProbLog's syntax rules.",
