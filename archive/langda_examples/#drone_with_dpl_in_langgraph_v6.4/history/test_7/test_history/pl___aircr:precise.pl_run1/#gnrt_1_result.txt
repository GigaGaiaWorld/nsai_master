Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5BCD04E8", "Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev, Old),\n goal(GP),\n Old \\= GP,\n use_actuator(Time, A),\n actuator_strength(A, AS),\n AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,\n wind_effect(Time, WE),\n Pos is Old + AE + WE,\n (legal_flap_position(Pos) -> true; overrun_exception(Time))."}
```

Note that I included the additional line `(legal_flap_position(Pos) -> true; overrun_exception(Time)).` from the generated_code as it appears to be part of the completed implementation of the <Langda> block's requirements. The hash value comes from the <HASH> tag in the origin_code.
