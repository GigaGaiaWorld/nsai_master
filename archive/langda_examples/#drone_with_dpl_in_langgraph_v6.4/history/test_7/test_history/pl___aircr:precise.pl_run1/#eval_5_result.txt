  "Report": "The code block contains critical syntax and logical errors. The main issue is the use of the unsupported `->` operator for conditional logic in ProbLog, which causes the `UnknownClause` error. Additionally, the block fails to properly implement the requirement to check if the current position matches the goal before attempting movement. The logic for calculating the new position and handling overrun exceptions is present but incorrectly implemented due to the syntax error. The block needs complete regeneration to use ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `(A, B); (\+A, C)` instead of `->`) and to properly implement all requirements including the goal-checking logic.",
