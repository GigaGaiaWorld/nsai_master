  "Report": "The code block calculates the attempted flap position (`Pos`) based on the previous position (`Old`), the goal position (`GP`), the actuator strength (`AS`), and the wind effect (`WE`). The logic for calculating the ideal movement (`AE`) and integrating the wind effect is correct, but the decreasing probabilities for `goal_reached` suggest that the wind effect might be overpowering the actuator's contribution. Additionally, the overrun exception logic does not account for cases where the wind effect pushes the flap position beyond legal bounds, leading to inconsistent probabilities. Recommendations include revising the goal condition, adjusting wind effect integration, clarifying overrun logic, improving actuator selection, and testing edge cases.",
