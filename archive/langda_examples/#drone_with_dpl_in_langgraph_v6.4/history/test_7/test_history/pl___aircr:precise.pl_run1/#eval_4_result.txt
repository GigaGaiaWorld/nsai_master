  "Report": "The `attempted_flap_position` predicate has several issues: 1) It does not properly handle cases where wind effects could push the flap beyond legal bounds (0-10), resulting in zero `overrun_exception` events despite strong wind conditions. 2) The decreasing probability of `goal_reached` suggests the actuator's effect is being overpowered by wind, indicating incorrect integration of wind effects. 3) The predicate lacks explicit checks for illegal positions after wind effects are applied. The code needs to be revised to: a) Properly bound the position calculation, b) Trigger `overrun_exception` when positions are illegal, and c) Rebalance the wind/actuator interaction to ensure progress toward the goal.",
