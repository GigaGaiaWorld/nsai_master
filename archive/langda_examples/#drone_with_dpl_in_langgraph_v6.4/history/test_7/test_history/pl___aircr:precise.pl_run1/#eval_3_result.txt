  "Report": "The code block implements the core logic for calculating the attempted flap position (`Pos`) by combining the previous position (`Old`), actuator movement (`AE`), and wind effect (`WE`). However, the test results reveal two key issues: (1) The decreasing probability of `goal_reached` suggests the wind effect may be overpowering the actuator's movement, causing suboptimal behavior, and (2) the absence of `overrun_exception` events indicates the system fails to handle illegal positions under extreme conditions. The logic for `(legal_flap_position(Pos) ; overrun_exception(Time))` is syntactically correct but may not account for edge cases where `Pos` is illegal. The wind effect integration needs refinement to ensure the flap moves toward the goal more reliably.",
