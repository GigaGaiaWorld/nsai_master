<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The code is intended to model an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, but it contains syntax and logical errors that prevent it from executing correctly. The primary issue is an `UnknownClause` error, which indicates that the ProbLog engine cannot find a definition for a predicate or operator used in the code. Additionally, the conditional statement syntax in the code is not supported in ProbLog, leading to further errors.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Error**: The conditional statement `(legal_flap_position(TempPos) -> Pos = TempPos ; overrun_exception(Time))` uses the `->` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog. This causes the `UnknownClause` error.
2. **Logical Error**: The code does not properly handle the case where the target position is already reached, as specified in the requirements.
3. **Integration Issue**: The code blocks are not seamlessly integrated, particularly in the handling of the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "5BCD04E8",
        "Report": "The code block uses the unsupported `->` operator for conditional logic in ProbLog. This operator is not part of ProbLog's syntax, leading to the `UnknownClause` error. Additionally, the logic for handling the case where the target position is already reached is missing, violating the requirements."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Replace Conditional Logic**: Replace the unsupported `->` operator with ProbLog-compatible control predicates like `if-then-else` using `(A, B); (\+A, C)`.
2. **Add Missing Logic**: Explicitly check if the current position `Old` matches the goal `GP` before attempting to move the flap.
3. **Test Integration**: Ensure all predicates are properly defined and integrated, especially `attempted_flap_position` and `flap_position`.
4. **Debugging**: Use ProbLog's debugging tools to trace predicate evaluations and identify further issues.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
