Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5BCD04E8", "Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev, Old),\n goal(GP),\n Old \\= GP,\n use_actuator(Time, A),\n actuator_strength(A, AS),\n AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,\n wind_effect(Time, WE),\n Pos is Old + AE + WE,\n (legal_flap_position(Pos) ; overrun_exception(Time))."}
```

Note that the main difference between the original and generated code is the replacement of the conditional operator `->` with a disjunction `;` in the last line, which fixes the syntax error mentioned in the report while maintaining the same logical behavior.
