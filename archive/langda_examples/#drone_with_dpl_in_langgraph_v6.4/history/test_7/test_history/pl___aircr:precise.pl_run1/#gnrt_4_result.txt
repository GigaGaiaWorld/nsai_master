Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5BCD04E8", "Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev, Old),\n goal(GP),\n Old \\= GP,\n use_actuator(Time, A),\n actuator_strength(A, AS),\n AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,\n wind_effect(Time, WE),\n TempPos is Old + AE + WE,\n (legal_flap_position(TempPos) -> Pos = TempPos ; overrun_exception(Time))."}
```

The key differences between the original <langda> block and the generated code are:
1. The generated code uses a temporary variable `TempPos` to calculate the position before checking legality
2. It uses a conditional (`->`) to either set the position or trigger an overrun exception
3. The structure is more explicit about handling illegal positions
