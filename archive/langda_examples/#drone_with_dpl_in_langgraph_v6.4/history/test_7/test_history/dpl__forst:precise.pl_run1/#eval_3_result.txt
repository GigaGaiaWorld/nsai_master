  "Report": "The `stack_op(sort, ...)` predicate is incomplete and contains a syntax error. The predicate should sort the top three elements of the stack and return them in ascending order, but the current implementation is malformed and does not compile. The requirement specifies sorting the top three elements, but the predicate does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than three elements. Additionally, the predicate is not properly integrated with the rest of the code, leading to parsing errors that prevent other stack operations from being tested.",
