Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, [X,Y,Z|Stack], SortedStack) :-\n    sort([X,Y,Z], [A,B,C]),\n    SortedStack = [A,B,C|Stack]."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with a <Langda> tag in the origin_code, and it's the implementation of the `sort` operation for the stack. The JSON includes the hash that was provided in the original code block and the completed code snippet.
