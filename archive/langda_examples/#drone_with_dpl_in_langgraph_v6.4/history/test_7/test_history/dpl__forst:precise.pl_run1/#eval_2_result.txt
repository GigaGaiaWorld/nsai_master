  "Report": "The `stack_op(sort, ...)` predicate is incomplete and malformed. The predicate is split into two parts without proper continuation or termination, causing a parsing error. Additionally, the implementation only sorts the top three elements and does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than three elements, which could lead to runtime errors. The requirements specify a custom stack operation that sorts elements at the top of the stack in ascending order, but the current implementation is too restrictive and error-prone.",
