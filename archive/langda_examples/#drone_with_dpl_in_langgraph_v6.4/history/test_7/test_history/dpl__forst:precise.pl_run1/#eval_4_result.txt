  "Report": "The `stack_op(sort, ...)` predicate is incomplete and contains a syntax error. The predicate should sort the top three elements of the stack and return them in ascending order, but the current implementation is malformed. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than three elements, which could lead to runtime errors. The predicate needs to be corrected to handle these cases and ensure it adheres to the requirements.",
