{"HASH": "6931D64E","Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete and problematic. It only handles stacks with at least three elements, lacks error handling for smaller stacks, and may contribute to the 'ParseError' due to improper integration with the rest of the code. The implementation should be extended to handle all stack sizes and properly integrated with the other operations.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
