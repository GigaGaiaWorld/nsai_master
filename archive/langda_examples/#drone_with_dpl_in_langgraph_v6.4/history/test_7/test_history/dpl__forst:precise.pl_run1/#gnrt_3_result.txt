Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` blocks in `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, [X,Y,Z|Stack], SortedStack) :- \n    sort([X,Y,Z], [A,B,C]), \n    SortedStack = [A,B,C|Stack]."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, Stack) :- length(Stack, L), L < 3."}
```

Note: Both code blocks relate to the same `<langda>` section (as they both implement the `stack_op(sort,...)` predicate), so they share the same HASH value from the original report. The second clause was added in the generated code to handle cases where the stack has fewer than 3 elements.
