  "Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete and does not fully implement the requirement to sort the top three elements of the stack. The current implementation checks the stack length and splits it but does not correctly sort the top three elements. The `sort(Top3, SortedTop3)` call is ambiguous and should specify the sorting order (e.g., `msort` or `sort/2` with a custom comparator). Additionally, the predicate does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than 3 elements gracefully. The test results do not include a query for the `sort` operation, making it impossible to verify its correctness.",

  "Report": "The `get_top_n` predicate lacks validation to ensure the stack has at least `N` elements. This could cause issues if the stack is shorter than `N`. A guard clause or explicit length check should be added. However, since this is not a `<langda>` code block, it does not need regeneration here. It should be addressed separately.",
