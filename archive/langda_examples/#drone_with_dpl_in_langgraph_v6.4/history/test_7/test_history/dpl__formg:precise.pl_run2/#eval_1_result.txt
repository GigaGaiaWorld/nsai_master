{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements by checking the list length and splitting it for recursive processing. However, the `split_list` predicate is inefficient and could be improved. The current implementation uses `length(Left, Half)` and `append(Left, Right, List)`, which is not optimal. A more efficient implementation would directly split the list without unnecessary length checks and appends. Despite this inefficiency, the block functions correctly and meets the requirements, so regeneration is not strictly necessary but recommended for optimization.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Report": "This code block correctly implements the recursive merge sort calls and the merging of the sorted sublists. The logic is sound, and the test result confirms its correctness. No issues are identified here, and the block fully meets the requirements. Regeneration is not needed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
