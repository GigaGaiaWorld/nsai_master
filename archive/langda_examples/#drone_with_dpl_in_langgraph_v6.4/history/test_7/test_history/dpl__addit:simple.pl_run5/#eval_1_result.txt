  "Report": "The `addition` predicate in this code block is logically correct and fulfills the requirements of performing addition on digits extracted from images. However, there is a syntactical issue where the predicate is split into two parts in the original code, which is not valid in ProbLog. The rule should be written as a single continuous block. Despite this, the logic itself is sound and the test case provided confirms its functionality. The issue is primarily about code structure rather than logic.",
