  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the addition logic as specified in the requirements. It successfully sums the digits associated with the input images (img_1 to img_0) and produces the correct result, as evidenced by the test case (addition(img_5,img_6,11)). However, the code lacks documentation and could benefit from comments explaining the predicate's purpose and parameters. Additionally, while not strictly necessary for functionality, error handling for invalid inputs could improve robustness.",
