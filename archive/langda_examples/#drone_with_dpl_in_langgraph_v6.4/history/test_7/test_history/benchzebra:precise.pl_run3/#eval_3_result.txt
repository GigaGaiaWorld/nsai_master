{"HASH": "CD409C7B","Report": "This code block correctly implements the rule that the owner of the red house is English (`my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)`). However, it is the only rule implemented, and the rest of the puzzle's constraints are missing. While this block itself is syntactically and logically correct for its specific rule, it is insufficient to solve the puzzle alone. It does not need regeneration, but it requires additional code blocks to implement the remaining constraints.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
