Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> block in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CD409C7B", "Code": "my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)"}
```

The generated code contains many additional constraints that weren't in the original <langda> block, but only the first line corresponds to the original incomplete code block with hash CD409C7B. The other constraints are new additions to solve the full puzzle.
