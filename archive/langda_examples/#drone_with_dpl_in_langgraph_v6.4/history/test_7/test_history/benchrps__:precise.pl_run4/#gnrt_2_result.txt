Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` blocks in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, S), ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; Winner = draw )."}
```

Note: The generated code fixed the syntax error mentioned in the report by using the `->` operator for conditional logic instead of commas, making it more readable and correct. The hash tag remains the same as provided in the original code block.
