  "Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate is incomplete and incorrectly formatted. The predicate should call `play/3` to generate results and then `compute_score/2` to determine the winner. The current implementation is fragmented and lacks proper syntax. The parsing error ('Ambiguous token role') indicates a syntax issue, likely due to improper use of semicolons or parentheses. The predicate should be rewritten to ensure correct ProbLog syntax and logical flow.",
