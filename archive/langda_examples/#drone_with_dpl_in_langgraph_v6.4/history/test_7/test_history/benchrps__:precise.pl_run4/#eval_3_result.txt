  "Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate is intended to calculate the winner by comparing the moves of two players and computing the score. The logic is sound, but the syntax is ambiguous, leading to a parsing error. The predicate should be defined as a single clause with proper punctuation and structure. The current implementation is incomplete and incorrectly formatted, causing the parser to fail. The predicate should be regenerated to ensure correct syntax and integration with the rest of the code.",
