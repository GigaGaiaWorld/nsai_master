Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, S), ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; Winner = draw )."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with `<langda>` in the original code, and it has been properly completed in the generated code. The JSON format includes the hash from the original report and the completed code snippet.
