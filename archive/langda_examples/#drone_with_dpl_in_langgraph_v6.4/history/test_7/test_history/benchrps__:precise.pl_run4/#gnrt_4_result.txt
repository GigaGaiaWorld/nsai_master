Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> blocks in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, S), ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; Winner = draw )."}
```

This is the only code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code, which was the incomplete `determine_winner` predicate. The generated code provides the correct implementation of this predicate.
