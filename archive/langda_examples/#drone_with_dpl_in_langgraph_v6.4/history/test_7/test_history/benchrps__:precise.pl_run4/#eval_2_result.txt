{"HASH": "FD850DEC","Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate for handling draws is correctly implemented. It ensures that a draw does not affect the score by passing the previous score unchanged. This aligns perfectly with the requirements. No syntax or logical issues are present, and the test results confirm its correctness.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7","Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate has a syntax error due to a misplaced comma and missing parentheses. While the logic is correct (it calculates the winner based on the score), the implementation needs to be regenerated to fix the syntax. The corrected version should group the conditional logic properly.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["FD850DEC"]}

It should be regenerated as `result(X, X, draw) :- move(X).` to correctly handle draws.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
