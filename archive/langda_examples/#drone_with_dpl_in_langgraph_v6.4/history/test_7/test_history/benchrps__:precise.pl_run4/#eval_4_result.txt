  "Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate is incorrectly formatted and contains syntax errors, leading to a parsing error ('Ambiguous token role'). The predicate should be rewritten as a single clause with proper indentation and without unnecessary line breaks. Additionally, the predicate does not properly integrate the `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates, leading to logical inconsistencies. The requirements specify that the predicate should call `play/3` to generate a Results list and then use `compute_score/2` to determine the winner, but the current implementation fails to do this correctly.",
