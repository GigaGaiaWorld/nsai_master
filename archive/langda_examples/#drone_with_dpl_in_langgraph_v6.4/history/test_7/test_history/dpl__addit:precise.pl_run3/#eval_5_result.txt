  "Report": "The `number/3` predicate contains critical issues: (1) It uses `length/1` which is not a valid ProbLog function, causing a syntax error. (2) The accumulation logic (`NewAcc is Acc + Nr * (10 ^ length(T))`) is incorrect for the requirement of adding to the 'low bit' (should be `NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr`). (3) The exponentiation approach misinterprets the digit placement (high bits should be on the right).",
