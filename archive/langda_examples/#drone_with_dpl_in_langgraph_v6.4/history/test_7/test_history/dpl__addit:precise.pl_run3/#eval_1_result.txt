{"HASH": "6579E7BA","Report": "The `number/3` predicate incorrectly accumulates digits by placing the new digit on the left side (low bit) of the accumulated value. This causes the digits to be reversed in the final number, violating the requirement to parse the image list from left to right into numbers. For example, processing [img_3, img_4] yields 43 instead of 34. The predicate needs to be modified to correctly accumulate digits from left to right by adding the new digit to the right side (high bit) of the accumulated value.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is syntactically correct and logically sound, but its output is incorrect due to the error in the `number/3` predicate it depends on. Once the `number/3` predicate is fixed, this predicate should work correctly. No regeneration is needed for this block itself, but it depends on the corrected `number/3` predicate.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["6579E7BA"]}
