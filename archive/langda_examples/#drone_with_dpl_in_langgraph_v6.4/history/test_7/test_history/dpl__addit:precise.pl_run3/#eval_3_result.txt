{"HASH": "6579E7BA","Report": "The `number/3` predicate incorrectly uses the `length/1` function, which is not available in ProbLog. The logic for accumulating the numerical value (`NewAcc is Acc + Nr * (10 ^ length(T))`) does not align with the requirement to add the current number to the 'low bit' of the accumulated value (high bit on the right). The correct logic should be `NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr`. This block needs regeneration to fix both the syntax and logical errors.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is incomplete and does not properly utilize the `number/3` predicate. It lacks the necessary logic to handle the arithmetic operation and integrate with the rest of the code. However, this block depends on the corrected `number/3` predicate (HASH 6579E7BA), so it should be regenerated after the `number/3` predicate is fixed.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["6579E7BA"]}
