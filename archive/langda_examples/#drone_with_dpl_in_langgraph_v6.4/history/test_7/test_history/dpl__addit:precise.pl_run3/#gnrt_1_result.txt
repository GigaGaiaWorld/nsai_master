Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "6579E7BA","Code": "number([H|T], Acc, Result) :- \n    digit(H, Nr),\n    NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr,\n    number(T, NewAcc, Result)."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <langda> in the origin_code and was completed in the generated_code. The hash matches the one provided in the <HASH> tag of the origin_code.
