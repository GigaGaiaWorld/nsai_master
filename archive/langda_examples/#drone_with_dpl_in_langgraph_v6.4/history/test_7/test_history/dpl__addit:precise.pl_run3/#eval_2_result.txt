  "Report": "The `number/3` predicate has a logical error where it incorrectly accumulates digits by placing the new digit in the low bit (left side) of the accumulated value, violating the requirement to place the high bit on the right. For example, [img_7, img_9] is converted to 97 instead of 79. The recursive logic should be adjusted to append the new digit to the right of the accumulated value. This requires regeneration to fix the digit placement logic.",
