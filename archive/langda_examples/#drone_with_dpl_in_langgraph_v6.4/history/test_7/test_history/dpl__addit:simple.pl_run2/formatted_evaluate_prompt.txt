System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A + B.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6E46AD63 </HASH>
<Requirements>addition logic, input as img_1 to img_0 </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.
<original_code>

digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).

digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A + B.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6E46AD63 </HASH>
<Requirements>addition logic, input as img_1 to img_0 </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements correctly. The test results confirm that the logic for addition works as expected, producing the correct output for the given query. However, there is a minor issue with the formatting of the code, which could be improved for better readability and maintainability.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No critical errors were identified in the code. The test results show that the addition logic works correctly, and the query produces the expected output. The only issue is the formatting of the code, which could be more consistent.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6E46AD63",
        "Report": "The code block for the `addition` predicate is correctly implemented and matches the requirements. It successfully uses the `digit` facts to perform addition. However, the formatting of the code could be improved for better readability. For example, the predicate definition is split across multiple lines without proper indentation."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Formatting**: Improve the formatting of the `addition` predicate by ensuring consistent indentation and line breaks. For example:
   

2. **Documentation**: Add comments to explain the purpose of the `digit` facts and the `addition` predicate for better maintainability.
3. **Testing**: Expand the test cases to cover more combinations of inputs to ensure the robustness of the addition logic.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
