Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code blocks that correspond to the <langda> blocks in the origin_code. However, I notice that in the generated_code, the two population entries that were marked with <langda> blocks in the origin_code (ussr and w_germany) have actually been removed entirely rather than being completed.

Since these entries don't appear in the generated_code at all, there are no corresponding code blocks to extract. The generated_code has removed these outdated entries rather than completing them.

Therefore, the correct output would be an empty list, as there are no completed code blocks corresponding to the <langda> sections in the generated_code.
