Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. The only difference is the change from "w_germany" to "west_germany" in both the pop and area predicates.

Here's the formatted output:

```problog
{"HASH": "4B748FEC", "Code": "pop(west_germany, 620)."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "4B748FEC", "Code": "area(west_germany, 96)."}
```

Note that while the original <Langda> block only contained the population fact, the generated code also changed the corresponding area fact to use "west_germany" instead of "w_germany". I've included both since they represent the complete transformation of the original code block.
