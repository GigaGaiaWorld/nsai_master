  "Report": "The code block for the `addition` predicate is logically correct and adheres to the requirements. It correctly sums the digits associated with the input images. The test case confirms it produces the correct output (11 for img_5 + img_6). The only issue is minor formatting (lack of indentation/spacing), which doesn't affect functionality. Recommendations: 1) Improve formatting for readability, 2) Add more test cases for edge cases, 3) Add documentation comments.",
