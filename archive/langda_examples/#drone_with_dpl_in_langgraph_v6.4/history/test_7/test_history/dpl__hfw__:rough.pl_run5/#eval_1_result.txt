  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate correctly implements recursive evaluation for arithmetic operations but fails to account for operator precedence, which is a critical requirement for arithmetic expression evaluation. The current left-to-right evaluation is incorrect for standard arithmetic rules (e.g., multiplication/division should precede addition/subtraction). Additionally, there is no check for division by zero, which could cause runtime errors. The predicate also assumes left-associativity, which may not always be desired. The test result shows correct output for the given query, but this is coincidental due to the specific expression structure.",
