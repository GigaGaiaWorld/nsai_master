  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate has significant logical issues regarding operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation of expressions. It currently processes operations strictly left-to-right without respecting standard arithmetic precedence rules (* and / should be evaluated before + and -). Additionally, while it correctly checks for division by zero, the error handling could be more user-friendly. The predicate meets basic requirements for handling all four operations but fails to implement them correctly for complex expressions.",
