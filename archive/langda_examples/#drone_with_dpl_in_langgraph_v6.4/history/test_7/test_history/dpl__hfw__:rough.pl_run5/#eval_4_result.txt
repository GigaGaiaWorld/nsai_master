  "Report": "The code block implements a recursive expression evaluator but fails to correctly parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions due to several issues:\n1. **Operator Precedence**: The parsing logic does not enforce correct operator precedence (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).\n2. **Parentheses Handling**: The `parse_atom` predicate attempts to handle parentheses but does not integrate properly with the rest of the parsing logic.\n3. **Failure Handling**: The predicates fail unexpectedly when encountering operators, disrupting the parsing flow.\n4. **Integration**: The `parse` predicate does not correctly process the output from `detect_all`, leading to incorrect results.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Rewrite the parsing logic to enforce correct operator precedence.\n2. Improve parentheses handling by ensuring recursive calls to `parse_add_sub` for nested expressions.\n3. Add debug statements to identify parsing failures.\n4. Test with additional cases, including edge cases like division by zero and nested parentheses.",
