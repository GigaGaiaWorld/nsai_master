  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate evaluates expressions left-to-right without considering operator precedence, leading to incorrect results for expressions with mixed operators (e.g., `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`). The current implementation processes operators in the order they appear, which violates standard arithmetic rules. Additionally, error handling is limited to division by zero, and there is no validation for invalid symbols. The predicate should be regenerated to implement proper operator precedence (e.g., using recursive descent parsing or explicit precedence levels) and robust error handling.",
