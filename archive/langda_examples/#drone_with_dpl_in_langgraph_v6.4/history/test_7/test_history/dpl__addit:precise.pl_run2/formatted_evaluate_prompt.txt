System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Requirements> complete the number/3, it's function includes: 1.Convert the head image to the corresponding number Nr 2.Add the current number Nr to the "low bit" of the accumulated value Acc (the high bit is on the right) 3.Continue to recursively process the remaining images </Requirements></Langda>
.
number(X,Y) :- number(X,0,Y).
multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- 

    number(X, XNum),
    number(Y, YNum),
    Z is XNum + YNum.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],391) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],391) = 1.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is designed to convert a list of image identifiers into a numerical value and perform addition on two such numbers. The test result shows that the addition of [img_7, img_9] (79) and [img_3, img_1, img_2] (312) yields 391, which is correct. However, the implementation has logical and syntactical issues that need to be addressed for robustness and correctness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. The `number/3` predicate is incomplete and lacks proper handling of the base case and recursive case.
2. The `multi_addition/3` predicate is syntactically incorrect and lacks a proper definition.
3. The `number/2` predicate is not properly integrated with the rest of the code.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6579E7BA",
        "Report": "The `number/3` predicate is intended to convert a list of images into a number by processing each image recursively. However, the base case `number([], Result, Result).` is correct, but the recursive case `number([Head|Tail], Acc, Result)` is incomplete. The logic for updating `Acc` (accumulator) is missing, and the predicate does not properly handle the conversion of the head image to a number and its integration into the accumulator."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is syntactically incorrect. It is missing the body of the predicate, and the current implementation does not define how the addition of two numbers is performed. The predicate should properly call `number/2` for both input lists and then compute their sum."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Complete the `number/3` predicate by ensuring the recursive case properly converts the head image to a number and updates the accumulator. For example:
   

2. Fix the `multi_addition/3` predicate by properly defining its body. For example:
   

3. Ensure the `number/2` predicate is properly integrated and calls `number/3` with an initial accumulator value of 0.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
