```report
{"HASH": "6579E7BA","Report": "The `number/3` predicate incorrectly implements the digit accumulation logic. The requirement specifies that the high bit should be on the right, but the current implementation (`NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr`) places the new digit on the right (high bit), causing digits to be accumulated in reverse order. For example, [img_7, img_9] yields 97 instead of 79. The predicate needs to be regenerated to correctly accumulate digits by placing the new digit on the left (low bit) of the accumulated value.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is incomplete (missing body), but the primary issue lies in the `number/3` predicate it depends on. Once `number/3` is fixed, this predicate should work correctly. No regeneration is needed for this block unless the `number/3` fix requires changes to its implementation.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["6579E7BA"]}
