  "Report": "The code block implements the core logic for converting a list of digit images to a number but fails due to using the unsupported 'length/1' predicate in ProbLog. The logic correctly handles digit conversion and positional value calculation (requirements 1-3), but the implementation needs adjustment to work in ProbLog. The error occurs during execution, not at the syntax level. A custom length calculation or alternative positional approach is needed.",
