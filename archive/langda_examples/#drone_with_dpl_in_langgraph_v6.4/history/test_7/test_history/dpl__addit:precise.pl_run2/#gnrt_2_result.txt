Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The only code block that was completed is the number/3 predicate implementation, which has the hash 6579E7BA from the origin_code.

Here's the formatted JSON:

```problog
{"HASH": "6579E7BA", "Code": "number([Head|Tail], Acc, Result) :- \n    digit(Head, Nr), \n    NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr, \n    number(Tail, NewAcc, Result)."}
```
