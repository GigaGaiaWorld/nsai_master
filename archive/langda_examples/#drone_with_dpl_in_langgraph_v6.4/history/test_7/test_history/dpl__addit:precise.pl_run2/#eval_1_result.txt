{"HASH": "6579E7BA","Report": "The `number/3` predicate is functionally correct but lacks proper integration of the base case (`number([], Result, Result)`). The recursive logic correctly processes the list and accumulates the result, but the base case should be explicitly documented. Additionally, the predicate assumes all input images are valid, which could lead to runtime errors. Recommendations: 1) Document the base case explicitly, 2) Add error handling for invalid image identifiers, 3) Test edge cases (e.g., empty lists).","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is syntactically and logically correct, as evidenced by the successful test case. However, the variable names (`X`, `Y`, `Z`) are not descriptive, reducing readability. Recommendations: 1) Use more descriptive variable names (e.g., `ImageList1`, `ImageList2`, `Sum`), 2) Add comments to clarify the logic. No functional issues were found, so regeneration is not strictly necessary, but improvements are recommended for maintainability.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
