  "Report": "The `number/3` predicate has a logical error in digit accumulation. It currently places new digits on the left (low bit) of the accumulated value, which reverses the intended numerical representation (e.g., [img_7, img_9] yields 97 instead of 79). This contradicts the requirement to place the high bit on the right. The predicate needs to be rewritten to correctly accumulate digits by appending them to the right of the accumulated value.",

  "Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate is incomplete and lacks proper implementation. While it currently produces correct results due to the reversed digit accumulation in `number/3`, this is coincidental and not reliable. The predicate needs to be properly implemented to handle the addition of two numbers derived from image lists, with clear logic that aligns with the requirements.",
