Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in the original code:

```report
{"HASH": "99C92279","Report": "The `implies(P,Q)` predicate correctly implements the logic where `P â‡’ Q` holds if `P` is unprovable or `Q` is provable. The use of `(\\+ prove(P); prove(Q))` is accurate and aligns with the requirements. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "1405B337","Report": "The `opposite(P)` predicate correctly implements the negation of `P` by checking if `P` is unprovable (`\\+ prove(P)`). This meets the requirements. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "C68F7B35","Report": "The `extend(List,Elem,Extended)` predicate correctly adds `Elem` to the head of `List` to form `Extended`. The implementation is straightforward and meets the requirements. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0F69CE0F","Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` predicate correctly defines `Y` as `X * 2`. The implementation is accurate and meets the requirements. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

### Summary:
- None of the code blocks require regeneration as they all meet their respective requirements and pass the provided test cases.
- No dependencies between code blocks were identified that would necessitate regeneration.
- The recommendations in the analysis (e.g., edge case handling, code clarity) are improvements but do not indicate a need for regeneration of the existing code.
