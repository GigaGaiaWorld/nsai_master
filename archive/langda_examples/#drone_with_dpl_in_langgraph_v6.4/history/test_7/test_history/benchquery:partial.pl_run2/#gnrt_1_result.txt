Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks that correspond to the <langda> blocks:

```problog
{"HASH": "901531DA", "Code": "pop(usa, 2119)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "4B748FEC", "Code": "area(germany, 96)."}
```

Note: 
1. The first <langda> block in origin_code was for USSR population, but in generated_code this was removed (as suggested by the report) and replaced with USA's population data.
2. The second <langda> block was for w_germany, which was updated to germany in the generated_code (as suggested by the report).
3. I've used the actual code that appears in the generated_code rather than what was in the <langda> blocks, since that's what was ultimately implemented.
