Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CD409C7B", "Code": "member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses"}
```

Note that:
1. The original <langda> block had a `my_member` predicate which was replaced with `member` in the generated code
2. The hash tag "CD409C7B" is preserved from the original <langda> block
3. Only the specific constraint about the red house and English owner was extracted, as this was the only part that matched the original <langda> block's content

The other constraints in the generated code were not part of the original <langda> block, so they weren't included in the extraction.
