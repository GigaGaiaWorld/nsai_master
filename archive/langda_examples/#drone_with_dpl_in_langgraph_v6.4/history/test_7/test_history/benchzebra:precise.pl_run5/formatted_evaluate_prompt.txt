</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>

        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code is intended to solve the classic "zebra puzzle" by modeling the arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given constraints. However, the code contains syntax errors and logical inconsistencies that prevent it from executing correctly. The test results indicate a syntax error related to an unmatched character, which is likely due to a missing parenthesis or incorrect predicate usage. Additionally, the logical implementation of the puzzle's constraints is incomplete or incorrect.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Error**: The error message indicates an unmatched character `(` at line 4, column 7. This suggests a missing closing parenthesis in the `member` predicate or a misplaced character.
2. **Logical Incompleteness**: The code does not fully implement the puzzle's constraints. For example, the `member` predicate is incomplete, and other constraints (e.g., the Spanish owning a dog, the green house being to the right of the ivory house) are missing.
3. **Predicate Issues**: The `right_of` and `next_to` predicates are defined but not used to enforce the puzzle's constraints.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "CD409C7B",
        "Report": "The `member` predicate is incomplete and contains a syntax error due to a missing closing parenthesis. The correct form should be `member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses).` Additionally, this predicate only partially addresses the puzzle's constraints (e.g., the owner of the red house is English). Other constraints are not implemented."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `houses` predicate defines the structure of the houses but does not enforce any constraints. The `right_of` and `next_to` predicates are defined but not utilized to enforce the puzzle's rules (e.g., the green house being to the right of the ivory house)."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax Errors**: Ensure all predicates are correctly closed with parentheses and properly formatted.
2. **Implement All Constraints**: Add predicates to enforce all the puzzle's rules, such as:
   - The Spanish owning a dog.
   - The green house being to the right of the ivory house.
   - The Norwegian living next to the blue house.
3. **Use Helper Predicates**: Utilize the `right_of` and `next_to` predicates to enforce spatial relationships between houses.
4. **Test Incrementally**: After fixing the syntax, test each constraint individually to ensure logical correctness before combining them.
5. **Complete the `member` Predicate**: Expand the `member` predicate to include all necessary attributes (e.g., color, nationality, pet, drink, smoke).
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
