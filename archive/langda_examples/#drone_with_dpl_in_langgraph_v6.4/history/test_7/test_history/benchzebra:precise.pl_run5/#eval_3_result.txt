  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)` correctly enforces the rule that the owner of the red house is English. However, this is the only rule implemented, leaving the rest of the puzzle's constraints unaddressed. This leads to overly permissive results in the test output. The block is syntactically correct but logically incomplete. It needs to be expanded to include all the puzzle's constraints to ensure a valid solution.",
