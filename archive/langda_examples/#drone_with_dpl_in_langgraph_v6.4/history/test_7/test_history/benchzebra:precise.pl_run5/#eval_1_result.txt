  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)` correctly identifies that the red house is owned by an English person, which is one of the puzzle's rules. However, it does not enforce any other constraints, making it insufficient for solving the puzzle. The test results show that this block alone allows multiple invalid configurations where the red house is placed in any position without considering other rules. This block needs to be integrated with additional constraints to fully solve the puzzle.",
