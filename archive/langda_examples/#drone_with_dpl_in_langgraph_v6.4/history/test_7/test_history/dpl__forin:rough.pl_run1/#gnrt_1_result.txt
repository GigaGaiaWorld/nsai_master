Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block in JSON format:

```problog
{
  "HASH": "501F546D",
  "Code": "% Corrected Insertion Sort in ProbLog\n\n% Base case: an empty list is already sorted\ninsertion_sort([], []).\n\n% Recursive case: insert the head into the sorted tail\ninsertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-\n    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),\n    insert(H, SortedTail, Sorted).\n\n% Insert an element into a sorted list\ninsert(X, [], [X]).\ninsert(X, [Y|T], [X,Y|T]) :-\n    X @=< Y.\ninsert(X, [Y|T], [Y|SortedT]) :-\n    X @> Y,\n    insert(X, T, SortedT).\n\n% Query example\nquery(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))."
}
```

Note: The generated code appears to be identical to the original code that was reported as having a logical error. There might be a misunderstanding in the task or the generated code might not have actually fixed the reported issue. The correct implementation should properly maintain the sorted order during insertion.
