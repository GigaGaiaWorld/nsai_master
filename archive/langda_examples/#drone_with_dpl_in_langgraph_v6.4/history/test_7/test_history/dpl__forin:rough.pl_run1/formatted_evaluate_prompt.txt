System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>% Corrected Insertion Sort in ProbLog

% Base case: an empty list is already sorted
insertion_sort([], []).

% Recursive case: insert the head into the sorted tail
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert(H, SortedTail, Sorted).

% Insert an element into a sorted list
insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [Y|T], [X,Y|T]) :-
    X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|T], [Y|SortedT]) :-
    X > Y,
    insert(X, T, SortedT).

% Query example
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 501F546D </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Result> Here are the testing result of code:

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements an insertion sort algorithm and appears to be syntactically correct. The test result confirms that the code successfully sorts the input list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating logical correctness for this specific case. However, further analysis is required to ensure robustness and correctness across all edge cases.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No major errors were identified in the code. The implementation adheres to the requirements of an interpretable insertion sort algorithm. The test result validates the correctness for the given input. However, potential edge cases (e.g., empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, or already sorted lists) should be tested to ensure comprehensive correctness.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "501F546D",
        "Report": "The code block implements the insertion sort algorithm correctly. The base case and recursive case are properly defined, and the `insert/3` predicate handles the insertion of elements into a sorted list as expected. The test result confirms the correctness for the provided input. However, additional test cases should be evaluated to ensure the code handles all edge cases."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Test Edge Cases**: Expand testing to include edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and already sorted lists to ensure the algorithm's robustness.
2. **Documentation**: Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and the overall logic for better interpretability.
3. **Performance Analysis**: If the list size is large, consider analyzing the performance of the insertion sort algorithm, as it has a quadratic time complexity in the worst case.
4. **Generalization**: Ensure the algorithm works for lists of any comparable elements (e.g., integers, floats) by verifying type handling.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
