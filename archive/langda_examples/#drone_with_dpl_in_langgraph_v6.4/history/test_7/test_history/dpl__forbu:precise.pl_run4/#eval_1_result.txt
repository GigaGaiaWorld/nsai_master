{"HASH": "2971FD2F","Report": "The `bubblesort` predicate is split into two parts, with the second part not properly integrated into the first part. This could lead to confusion or errors during execution. Additionally, the `hole` predicate is defined twice with the same functionality, which is redundant. The code block should be regenerated to merge the `bubblesort` predicate into a single, cohesive block and remove redundant definitions.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "5CBF7C6A","Report": "The `swap` predicate is logically correct but could be simplified or better documented. The conditions `X > Y` and `X =< Y` are clear, but the predicate names (`swap` and `no_swap`) could be more descriptive. While the code block does not need regeneration for functionality, it could benefit from improved clarity and documentation.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
