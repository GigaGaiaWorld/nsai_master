  "Report": "The `game/3` predicate has several critical issues: (1) It references undefined variables `OwnCards` and `OpponentCards` which should either be passed as arguments or derived within the predicate. (2) The predicate body is incomplete/missing closing parenthesis. (3) The logic depends on `game/4` which isn't properly integrated. While the rank comparison logic itself is correct, these structural issues prevent proper execution. The timeout error in testing confirms these problems.",

  "Report": "The `game/2` predicate is syntactically correct and properly implements the requirement of randomly selecting a house card via `house_rank/1`. However, its functionality is compromised because it depends on the broken `game/3` predicate (HASH EF02D81B). The timeout error stems from this dependency rather than issues in this block itself. Once the dependent predicate is fixed, this block should work as intended.",
