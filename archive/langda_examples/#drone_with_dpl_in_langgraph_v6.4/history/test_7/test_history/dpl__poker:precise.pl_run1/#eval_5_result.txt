  "Report": "The `game/3` predicate is incomplete and incorrectly references `OwnCards` and `OpponentCards`. These variables are not defined within the scope of the predicate, leading to logical errors. Additionally, the predicate lacks proper termination conditions, which could contribute to the timeout error. The predicate should be regenerated to properly define and scope these variables and ensure correct logic for computing the outcome.",

{
  "HASH": "N/A (Main Code Block)",
  "Report": "The main code block defines probabilistic facts and rules for hand evaluation but may contain inefficiencies in the `best_hand` and `best_hand_rank` predicates. These predicates use negation (`\+`) and recursive comparisons, which can lead to non-termination or excessive computation time. While the main logic is mostly correct, it could benefit from optimization to prevent timeout errors. However, the primary issue lies in the `game/3` predicate, so regeneration of the main block is not immediately necessary unless further testing reveals specific issues.",
