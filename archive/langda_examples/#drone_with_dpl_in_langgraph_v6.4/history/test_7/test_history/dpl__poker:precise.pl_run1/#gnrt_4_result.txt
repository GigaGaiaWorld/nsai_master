Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` blocks in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "EF02D81B", "Code": "game(Cards,House,Outcome) :-\n game(Cards,House,H1,H2),\n best_hand_rank(OwnCards,R1),\n best_hand_rank(OpponentCards,R2),\n outcome(R1,R2,Outcome)."}
```

Note: There was only one `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`, so only one code block was extracted. The hash value "EF02D81B" was taken from the `<HASH>` tag in the `<origin_code>` that corresponded to this code block.
