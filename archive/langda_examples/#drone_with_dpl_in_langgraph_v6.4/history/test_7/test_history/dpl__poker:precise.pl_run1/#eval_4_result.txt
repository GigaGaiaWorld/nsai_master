  "Report": "The `game/3` predicate is incomplete and incorrectly references `OwnCards` and `OpponentCards` without proper scoping. The predicate should ensure these variables are correctly derived from the input `Cards` and `House`. Additionally, the `House` variable is not properly defined or constrained, leading to potential logical errors. The timeout error suggests inefficiencies or infinite loops in the logic. Recommendations include completing the predicate definition, optimizing the logic to avoid timeouts, and ensuring proper variable scoping.",
