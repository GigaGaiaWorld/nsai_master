  "Report": "The `inf/1` rules in this code block are not correctly implementing the requirements. The issues include: 1) Incorrect handling of negation (`\+ susceptible(X)`) in probabilistic contexts, 2) Probabilistic annotations (`0.6::inf(X)` and `0.8::inf(X)`) not being applied dynamically as intended, and 3) The `riskyTravel(X)` rule not being evaluated (as evidenced by test results showing only initial infection probabilities). The block needs regeneration to properly implement contact transmission (with susceptibility conditions) and travel risk probabilities.",
