Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\ninf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+ susceptible(X), 0.6::inf(X).\ninf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X), 0.8::inf(X).\ninf(X) :- riskyTravel(X), 0.2::inf(X)."}
```

Note that:
1. I've used the same HASH value (E09B4F54) from the original code block
2. The code includes the corrected version with the `\+ susceptible(X)` condition that was missing in the original
3. The format follows the requested JSON structure with the problog syntax highlighting indicator
