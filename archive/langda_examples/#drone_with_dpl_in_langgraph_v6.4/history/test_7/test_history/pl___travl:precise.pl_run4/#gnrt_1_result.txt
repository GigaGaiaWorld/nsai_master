Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54","Code": "inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\ninf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), 0.6::inf(X).\ninf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X), 0.8::inf(X).\ninf(X) :- riskyTravel(X), 0.2::inf(X)."}
```

Note that:
1. I've used the HASH value provided in the origin_code (E09B4F54)
2. The code block is exactly the one that replaced the <Langda> section in the generated_code
3. The code has been modified from the original requirements by removing the `\+susceptible(X)` condition in the second rule, as shown in the generated_code
