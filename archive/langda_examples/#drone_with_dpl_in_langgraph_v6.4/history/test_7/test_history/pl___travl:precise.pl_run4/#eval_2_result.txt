  "Report": "The `inf/1` rules in this code block are not correctly implementing the specified requirements. The test results only show initial infection probabilities (0.1), ignoring the additional probabilities from contact transmission (0.6/0.8) and travel risk (0.2). The rules for contact transmission and travel risk are defined but not effectively evaluated, likely due to incorrect probability accumulation or rule triggering. The `susceptible/1` predicate is not properly utilized to differentiate between the two contact transmission scenarios. The block needs regeneration to correctly combine probabilities from all sources and properly use the `susceptible/1` predicate.",
