System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Code>

person(a).
person(b).
0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).
0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).

inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X), 0.8::inf(X).
inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X), 0.2::inf(X).</Code_Block>
<Report>The `inf/1` rules in this code block are not correctly implementing the specified requirements. The test results only show initial infection probabilities (0.1), ignoring the additional probabilities from contact transmission (0.6/0.8) and travel risk (0.2). The rules for contact transmission and travel risk are defined but not effectively evaluated, likely due to incorrect probability accumulation or rule triggering. The `susceptible/1` predicate is not properly utilized to differentiate between the two contact transmission scenarios. The block needs regeneration to correctly combine probabilities from all sources and properly use the `susceptible/1` predicate.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
