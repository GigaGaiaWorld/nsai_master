  "Report": "The `attempted_flap_position` predicate has the following issues: 1) It does not ensure the calculated `Pos` remains within the legal range (0-10), leading to overrun exceptions. 2) The calculation of `AE` (actuator effect) does not prevent overshooting the target (`GP`), resulting in inefficient movement. 3) The wind disturbance (`WE`) is added without constraints, which can cause excessive deviations. The predicate should be regenerated to include boundary checks, efficient movement logic, and constrained wind effects.",
