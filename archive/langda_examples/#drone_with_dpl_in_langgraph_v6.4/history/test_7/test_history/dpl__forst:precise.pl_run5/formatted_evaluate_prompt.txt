System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).
stack_op(pop, [_|Stack], Stack).
stack_op(dup, [X|Stack], [X,X|Stack]).
stack_op(swap, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X|Stack]).
stack_op(over, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X,Y|Stack]).
stack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Stack], [Z,X,Y|Stack]).
stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-

    (   length(Stack, L), L >= 3
    ->  get_top_n(Stack, 3, Top3, Rest),
        sort(Top3, SortedTop3),
        append(SortedTop3, Rest, SortedStack)
    ;   SortedStack = Stack
    ).</Code_Block>

<Requirements>A custom stack operation: sort, which sorts the three elements at the top of the stack in ascending order and then puts them back to the original stack. </Requirements></Langda>
.
get_top_n(Stack, N, Elements, Rest) :-
 length(Elements, N),
 append(Elements, Rest, Stack).
query(stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],[1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],[3, 1, 2, 4]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase implements a stack with various operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`). The test results show that all operations except `sort` work as expected. The `sort` operation is partially implemented but lacks proper testing and validation. The overall code quality is good, but the `sort` operation needs refinement to meet the specified requirements.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Missing Test for `sort` Operation**: The test results do not include any output for the `sort` operation, indicating it was not tested or failed silently.
2. **Logical Issue in `sort` Operation**: The `sort` operation is supposed to sort the top three elements of the stack, but the implementation does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than three elements correctly. The current logic only checks if the stack length is >= 3, but the requirement does not specify this constraint.
3. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `sort` operation does not fully adhere to the requirement of sorting the top three elements and leaving the rest of the stack unchanged.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6931D64E",
        "Report": "The `sort` operation is implemented to sort the top three elements of the stack, but it fails to handle stacks with fewer than three elements gracefully. The requirement does not specify any constraints on stack length, so the operation should either sort the available elements or leave the stack unchanged if fewer than three elements are present. Additionally, the test results do not include any output for this operation, suggesting it was not tested or failed during execution."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Test the `sort` Operation**: Add test cases for the `sort` operation to verify its correctness, including stacks with fewer than three elements.
2. **Refine the `sort` Logic**: Modify the `sort` operation to handle stacks of any length. If the stack has fewer than three elements, it should either sort the available elements or leave the stack unchanged.
3. **Document Constraints**: Clearly document any constraints or assumptions about the stack length for the `sort` operation to avoid confusion.
4. **Validate Integration**: Ensure the `sort` operation integrates seamlessly with the rest of the stack operations and does not introduce unintended side effects.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
