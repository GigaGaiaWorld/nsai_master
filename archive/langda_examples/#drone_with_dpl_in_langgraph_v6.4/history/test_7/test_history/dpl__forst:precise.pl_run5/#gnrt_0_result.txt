Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> blocks:

```problog
{"HASH": "E659D458", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "sort([X,Y,Z|Stack], [A,B,C|Stack]) :- sort0([X,Y,Z], [A,B,C])."}
```

Note: The second code block appears to be incomplete in the generated_code (missing the sort0 predicate implementation), but I've included what was provided. If you need the full implementation of the sort operation, you may need to provide the complete generated_code.
