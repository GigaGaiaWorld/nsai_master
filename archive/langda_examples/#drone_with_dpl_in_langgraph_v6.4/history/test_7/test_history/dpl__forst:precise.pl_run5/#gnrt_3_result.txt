Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    (   length(Stack, L), L >= 3\n    ->  get_top_n(Stack, 3, Top3, Rest),\n        sort(Top3, SortedTop3),\n        append(SortedTop3, Rest, SortedStack)\n    ;   SortedStack = Stack\n    )."}
```

This JSON contains:
1. The same HASH value from the original report ("6931D64E")
2. The completed implementation of the `stack_op(sort, ...)` predicate which now:
   - Checks if the stack has at least 3 elements
   - Only performs the sort operation when there are enough elements
   - Returns the original stack unchanged when there are fewer than 3 elements
   - Properly handles the sorting and reintegration of the top 3 elements
