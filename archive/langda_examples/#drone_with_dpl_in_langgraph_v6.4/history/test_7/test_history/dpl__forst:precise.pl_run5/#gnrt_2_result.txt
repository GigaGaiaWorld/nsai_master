Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    get_top_n(Stack, 3, Top3, Rest),\n    sort(Top3, SortedTop3),\n    append(SortedTop3, Rest, SortedStack)."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with a <langda> tag in the origin_code and has been completed in the generated_code. The JSON includes:
- The original HASH from the <langda> block
- The completed implementation of the sort operation that properly handles:
  - Getting the top 3 elements
  - Sorting them with Prolog's built-in sort/2
  - Recombining them with the rest of the stack
