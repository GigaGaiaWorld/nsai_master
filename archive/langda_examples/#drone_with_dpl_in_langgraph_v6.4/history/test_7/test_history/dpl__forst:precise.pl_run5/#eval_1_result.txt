{"HASH": "6931D64E","Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete and contains a syntax error. The predicate `sort([X,Y,Z|Stack], [A,B,C|Stack]) :- sort0([X,Y,Z], [A,B,C]).` is problematic because: 1. `sort0` is not defined, leading to a missing predicate error. 2. The clause does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than three elements. 3. The implementation does not ensure the sorted elements are returned to the stack correctly. This code block needs regeneration to properly implement the sorting functionality and handle edge cases.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
