  "Report": "The `stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)` predicate is incomplete and incorrectly implemented. It references `get_top_n` to extract the top 3 elements, but `get_top_n` is not correctly implemented. The `sort` operation does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than 3 elements, which could lead to runtime errors. The predicate should be regenerated to include proper logic for extracting, sorting, and reintegrating the top 3 elements, as well as handling edge cases.",
