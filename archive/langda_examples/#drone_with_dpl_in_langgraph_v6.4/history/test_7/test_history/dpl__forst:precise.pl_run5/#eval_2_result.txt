  "Report": "The `stack_op(sort, [X,Y,Z|Stack], [A,B,C|Stack])` clause has several issues: (1) It uses an undefined `sort0` predicate which will cause runtime errors, (2) The implementation doesn't guarantee ascending order sorting as required, (3) The clause only handles stacks with exactly 3 elements, failing for other cases. The predicate should be reimplemented using Prolog's built-in `sort/2` or a proper sorting algorithm that works for any stack size >= 3.",
