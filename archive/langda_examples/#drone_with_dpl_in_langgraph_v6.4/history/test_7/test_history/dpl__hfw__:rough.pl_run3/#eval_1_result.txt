  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate evaluates expressions left-to-right without considering operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation of expressions like `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`. The correct evaluation should respect standard arithmetic precedence (e.g., multiplication and division before addition and subtraction). Additionally, the predicate lacks error handling for division by zero and invalid input. The predicate should be regenerated to implement proper operator precedence and error handling.",
