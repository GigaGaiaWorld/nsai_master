  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is correctly implemented to handle arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and meets the requirements. However, the error indicates an integration issue where the predicate is not accessible during execution. This is likely due to improper linking or inclusion in the main ProbLog program, not a flaw in the predicate itself. The predicate does not need regeneration as the logic is sound; instead, the focus should be on ensuring proper integration and accessibility.",
