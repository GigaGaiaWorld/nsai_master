System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable merge_sort/2 algorithm </Requirements></Langda>
.
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

.
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test results indicate that it correctly sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the given requirements. However, there are minor issues related to integration and redundancy in the codebase.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Redundant Code**: The `append/3` predicate is defined but not used in the merge sort implementation, which could lead to confusion.
2. **Integration Issue**: The `query` statement is not part of the ProbLog model and should be handled separately or integrated properly.
3. **Unused Predicate**: The `append/3` predicate is unnecessary for the merge sort algorithm and should be removed to avoid clutter.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "418D2062",
        "Report": "The merge sort implementation is correct and adheres to the requirements. The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` are well-defined and work as expected. The test results confirm the logical correctness of the implementation."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for the `append/3` and `query` block)",
        "Report": "The `append/3` predicate is redundant and unused in the merge sort algorithm. The `query` statement is not part of the ProbLog model and should be handled separately or integrated into the model for proper execution."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Remove Redundant Code**: Delete the `append/3` predicate as it is not used in the merge sort implementation.
2. **Proper Query Handling**: Ensure the `query` statement is part of the ProbLog model or handled separately in the execution environment.
3. **Code Clarity**: Add comments to explain the purpose of each predicate (`merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, `merge/3`) for better readability and maintainability.
4. **Testing**: Expand the test cases to include edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and already sorted lists to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
