```report
{"HASH": "418D2062","Report": "The code block implements a correct merge sort algorithm in standard Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator in the `merge/3` predicate. ProbLog does not support conditional constructs like `->/2`, which are used for branching logic in the merge step. The code needs to be regenerated to replace the `->/2` operator with ProbLog-compatible logic, such as separate clauses for each condition or supported control predicates like `;/2`.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The `append/3` predicate is included but irrelevant to the merge sort logic. It should be removed to avoid confusion. The query format is also incorrect for ProbLog, which requires probabilistic or evidence-based queries. This code block does not need regeneration but should be removed or replaced with a ProbLog-compatible query.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
