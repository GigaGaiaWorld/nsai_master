  "Report": "The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, the `split/4` predicate is inefficient as it uses `length/2` and `append/3` to split the list. A more efficient approach would be to traverse the list directly to split it. Additionally, the `merge/3` predicate could be optimized for readability by combining the two comparison cases into a single clause with a disjunction. The code block meets the requirements but could benefit from optimization.",
