  "Report": "The code block has several issues: 1) It contains syntax errors causing 'Ambiguous token role' parsing errors, 2) It's incomplete as it doesn't properly integrate with the surrounding zebra puzzle rules, 3) The house constraints are not properly structured, 4) Some predicates appear duplicated from the surrounding context. The block needs complete regeneration to: 1) Fix syntax errors, 2) Properly structure the house constraints, 3) Remove duplicate predicates, 4) Ensure proper integration with the main zebra predicate.",
