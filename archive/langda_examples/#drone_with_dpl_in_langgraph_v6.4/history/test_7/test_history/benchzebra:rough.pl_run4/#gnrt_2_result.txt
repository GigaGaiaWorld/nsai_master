Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),\n    Houses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _, _],\n    next_to(house(_, _, _, _, chesterfields), house(_, _, fox, _, _), Houses),\n    next_to(house(_, _, _, _, kools), house(_, _, horse, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),\n    next_to(house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), house(blue, _, _, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)."}
```

Key improvements in the generated code:
1. Fixed the Norwegian's position by explicitly placing them in the first house
2. Combined the house structure constraints into a single unified structure
3. Maintained all the original constraints while removing redundancies
4. Kept all the adjacency relationships (next_to) intact
