  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains invalid ProbLog syntax due to the presence of placeholders (`<Langda>`). The `zebra` rule is fragmented and lacks proper integration with the `houses` predicate. Additionally, the `Houses` list is redundantly defined, which can cause logical inconsistencies. The test results indicate an 'Ambiguous token role' error, further confirming the syntax issues. The code block needs to be regenerated to ensure proper syntax, logical consistency, and integration with the rest of the program.",
