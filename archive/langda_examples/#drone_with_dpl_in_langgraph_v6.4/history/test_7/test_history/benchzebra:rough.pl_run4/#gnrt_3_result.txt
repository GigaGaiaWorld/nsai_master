Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here is the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),
    Houses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _, _],
    next_to(house(_, _, _, _, chesterfields), house(_, _, fox, _, _), Houses),
    next_to(house(_, _, _, _, kools), house(_, _, horse, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),
    next_to(house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), house(blue, _, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)."}
```

Note that this is the completed version of the code block that was marked with <langda> in the origin_code. The HASH value matches the one provided in the original <langda> section.
