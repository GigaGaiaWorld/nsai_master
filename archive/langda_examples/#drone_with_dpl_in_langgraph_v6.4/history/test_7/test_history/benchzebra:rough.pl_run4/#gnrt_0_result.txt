Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the completed code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> section in origin_code appears to be a placeholder for completing the rules in the zebra puzzle implementation. Looking at the generated_code, the completed version includes all the necessary predicates and rules.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),\n    Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _,_],\n    Houses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)|_],\n    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,chesterfields), house(_,_,fox,_,_), Houses),\n    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,kools), house(_,_,horse,_,_), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),\n    next_to(house(_,norwegian,_,_,_), house(blue,_,_,_,_), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)."}
