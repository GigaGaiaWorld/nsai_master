  "Report": "The code block has several issues: 1) It contains duplicate constraints that also appear in the main zebra predicate (e.g., the kools, norwegian, and next_to conditions), 2) The structure appears to be mixing fact declarations with rule constraints which is causing parsing errors, 3) The requirements ask for completing rules but this block seems to be duplicating existing constraints rather than adding new ones. The error message indicates an 'Ambiguous token role' which suggests Prolog is having trouble parsing this structure.",
