  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains syntax errors. The `zebra` predicate is missing a closing parenthesis and a comma after the initial constraints. Additionally, the constraints in this block do not fully cover all the puzzle's requirements, leading to potential logical gaps. The timeout error suggests inefficiency or infinite loops, likely due to poorly optimized predicates like `next_to` and `right_of`. The block needs to be regenerated to fix syntax issues, complete the constraints, and optimize the predicates.",
