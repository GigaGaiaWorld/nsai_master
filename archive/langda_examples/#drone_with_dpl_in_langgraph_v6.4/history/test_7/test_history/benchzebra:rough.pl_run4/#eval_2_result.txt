  "Report": "The code block implements the Zebra Puzzle constraints correctly but has redundancies (duplicate constraints) and lacks strict enforcement of the Norwegian's house position. The test results show valid solutions but also include invalid ones where the Norwegian is not in the first house. Recommendations: (1) Remove redundant constraints, (2) Strictly enforce the Norwegian's position as the first house, (3) Improve variable naming for clarity, and (4) Add comments for maintainability.",
