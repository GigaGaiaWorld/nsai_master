  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the addition logic as specified in the requirements. It successfully sums the digits associated with the input images (img_1 to img_0) and produces the correct result, as confirmed by the test case. However, the code lacks comments or documentation, which could improve maintainability and clarity. No critical errors or logical issues were found. Minor improvements like adding comments or error handling could be made, but these do not necessitate regeneration of the code block.",
