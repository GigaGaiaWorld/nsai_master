System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A + B.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6E46AD63 </HASH>
<Requirements>addition logic, input as img_1 to img_0 </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).

<Langda>
<Code_Block>addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A + B.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6E46AD63 </HASH>
<Requirements>addition logic, input as img_1 to img_0 </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code is syntactically valid and correctly implements the specified requirements for performing addition on digit-labeled images. The test result confirms that the logic works as intended, producing the correct output for the query `addition(img_5,img_6,Z)`. However, the code could benefit from minor improvements for clarity and robustness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No critical errors were identified in the code. The test result demonstrates that the logic is functioning correctly. However, the code lacks comments or documentation, which could make it less maintainable or understandable for others.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6E46AD63",
        "Report": "The code block defines the `addition` predicate, which correctly sums the digits associated with the input images. The logic is sound, but the predicate could be documented to explain its purpose and parameters."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Add Comments**: Include comments to explain the purpose of the `digit` facts and the `addition` predicate. For example:
   


2. **Error Handling**: Consider adding checks to ensure the inputs are valid (e.g., the images exist in the `digit` facts). For example:
   


3. **Testing**: Expand the test cases to cover edge cases, such as adding `img_0` to other digits or invalid inputs.

4. **Modularity**: If the codebase grows, consider organizing the `digit` facts into a separate module or file for better maintainability.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
