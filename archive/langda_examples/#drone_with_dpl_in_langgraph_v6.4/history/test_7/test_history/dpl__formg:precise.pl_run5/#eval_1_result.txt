```report
{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: it checks the length of the list, ensures the list is split only if its length is greater than 1, and splits the list into `Left` and `Right`. However, the `split_list` predicate uses `append` to split the list, which is inefficient. A more efficient approach would be to directly split the list without using `append`. Despite this inefficiency, the code is functionally correct and passes the test case. Therefore, regeneration is not strictly necessary but could be considered for optimization purposes.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Report": "This code block correctly implements the recursive merge sort logic: it recursively sorts the left and right halves and merges them. The `merge` predicate is also correctly implemented. However, the merging logic could be made more concise by combining the two `merge` clauses for `H1 =< H2` and `H1 > H2` into a single clause with a conditional. The current implementation is functionally correct and passes the test case, so regeneration is not strictly necessary but could be considered for code clarity and conciseness.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
