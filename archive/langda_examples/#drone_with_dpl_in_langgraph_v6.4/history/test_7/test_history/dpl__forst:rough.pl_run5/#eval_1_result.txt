The `get_top_n` predicate is logically correct but assumes the stack has sufficient elements, which could cause issues if not validated. The absence of test cases for `sort` leaves its functionality unverified. This block needs regeneration to include the missing `insertion_sort` predicate and proper error handling for stack size validation.",
