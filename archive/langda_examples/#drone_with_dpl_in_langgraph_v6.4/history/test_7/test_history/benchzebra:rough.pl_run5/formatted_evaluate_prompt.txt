System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code is intended to solve the classic "zebra puzzle," which involves deducing the arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of clues. The code is mostly syntactically correct, but it is incomplete and contains logical gaps that prevent it from executing successfully. The test results indicate a timeout error, suggesting that the code either enters an infinite loop or fails to terminate within the expected time frame due to unresolved constraints or missing rules.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Incomplete Code**: The code is missing a closing parenthesis and a comma in the `zebra` predicate, which disrupts the logical flow.
2. **Logical Gaps**: Some constraints in the puzzle are not fully implemented, such as the requirement for the yellow house to be associated with "kools."
3. **Timeout Error**: The timeout during testing suggests that the solver is unable to find a valid solution within the allotted time, likely due to unresolved constraints or infinite recursion.
4. **Integration Issues**: The `my_member` and `next_to` predicates are correctly defined, but their usage in the `zebra` predicate may not fully align with the puzzle's requirements.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "0F506A43",
        "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is correctly placed but lacks context. It should be integrated into the `zebra` predicate with proper syntax (e.g., a comma separator). Additionally, the puzzle requires that the yellow house is associated with 'kools,' but this constraint is not fully enforced in the rest of the code."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax Errors**: Ensure all predicates in the `zebra` rule are properly separated by commas and closed with a parenthesis.
2. **Complete the Rules**: Add missing constraints to fully implement the puzzle's requirements, such as ensuring the yellow house is associated with "kools" and other attributes.
3. **Optimize Constraints**: Review the `next_to` and `my_member` predicates to ensure they are used efficiently and do not cause infinite loops.
4. **Debugging**: Test the code incrementally to identify which constraints are causing the timeout and refine them.
5. **Documentation**: Add comments to clarify the purpose of each constraint for better maintainability.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
