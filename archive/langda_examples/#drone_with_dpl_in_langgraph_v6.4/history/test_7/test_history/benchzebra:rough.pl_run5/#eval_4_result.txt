  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is syntactically correct and implements a valid constraint for the zebra puzzle (associating the yellow house with 'kools'). However, the test timeout suggests that the overall puzzle constraints may not be fully integrated or optimized. This block itself does not need regeneration, but the surrounding code (e.g., missing commas, incomplete rules) should be fixed to ensure proper execution.",
