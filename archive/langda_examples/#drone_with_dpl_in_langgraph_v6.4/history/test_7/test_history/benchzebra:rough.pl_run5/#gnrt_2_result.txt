Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> section in origin_code was incomplete with a placeholder, and in generated_code it has been completed as:
`my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)`

Here's the formatted JSON response:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```
