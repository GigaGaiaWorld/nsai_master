  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains a placeholder (`<Langda>`). The placeholder disrupts the logical flow of the code and prevents it from being executed properly. The requirement to 'complete the rules' suggests that some constraints or predicates are missing. The timeout error in the test results indicates that the incomplete code may be causing unresolved constraints or infinite recursion. The block should be regenerated to include the missing rules or constraints required for solving the zebra puzzle.",
