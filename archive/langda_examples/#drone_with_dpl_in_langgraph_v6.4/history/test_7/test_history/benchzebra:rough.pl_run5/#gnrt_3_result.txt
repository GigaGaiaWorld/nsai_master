Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <langda> in the origin_code, and it appears unchanged in the generated_code. The HASH value matches the one provided in the <langda> section.
