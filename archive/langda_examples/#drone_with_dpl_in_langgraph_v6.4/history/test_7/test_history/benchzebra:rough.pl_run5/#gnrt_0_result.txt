Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the completed code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code appears between two existing predicates and has a hash tag of 0F506A43. In the generated_code, the corresponding completed code is the line:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```

This is the only code block that was completed in the generated_code that wasn't present in the origin_code (where the <Langda> placeholder was). The rest of the code remains unchanged between the origin and generated versions.
