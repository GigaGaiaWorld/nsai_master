Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> section in origin_code had a hash of 0F506A43 and contained an incomplete code block that needed to be completed. In the generated_code, this corresponds to the line:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <Langda> in the origin_code, and it appears unchanged in the generated_code (though the report suggested it might be redundant, it was kept in the final version).
