  "HASH": "0F506A43",
  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is incomplete and disrupts the logical flow of the puzzle. This rule is critical as it specifies that the house with the 'yellow' color has 'kools' as the cigarette brand. The incompleteness likely contributes to the timeout error by causing inefficient backtracking or missing constraints. The block should be completed to fully integrate this constraint into the puzzle logic.",
