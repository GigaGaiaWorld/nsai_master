{"HASH": "47D659C8","Report": "The code block implements a valid Prolog bubblesort algorithm but fails in ProbLog due to the use of the `->` operator, which is unsupported. The logic is correct for Prolog but needs adaptation for ProbLog. The `reverse/2` and `append/3` predicates are correctly implemented but may not be necessary for ProbLog's probabilistic context.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The `forth_sort/2` predicate and `query` statement are not properly formatted for ProbLog. The `query` should be written directly as `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X).` without the `query` wrapper. The predicate definition should also be adjusted to match ProbLog's syntax.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["47D659C8"]}
