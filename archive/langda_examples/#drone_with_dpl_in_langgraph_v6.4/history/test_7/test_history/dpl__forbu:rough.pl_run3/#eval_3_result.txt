  "Report": "The code block implements a bubblesort algorithm but has a logical error in the `bubble_pass` predicate where it swaps elements when `X > Y`, resulting in descending order sorting. The `reverse` and `append` operations in the `bubblesort` predicate are unnecessary if the sorting is corrected to ascending order. The test result confirms the incorrect behavior with output `[12, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1]` instead of `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`.",
