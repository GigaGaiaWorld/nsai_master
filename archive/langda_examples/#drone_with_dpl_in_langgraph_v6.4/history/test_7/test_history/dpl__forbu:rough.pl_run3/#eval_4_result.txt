  "Report": "The `bubblesort/3` predicate is intended to sort a list in ascending order, but the current implementation does not achieve this. The issue stems from the `bubble_pass/3` predicate, which incorrectly handles the swapping of elements. The `Swapped` flag is not being used to terminate the sorting loop when no more swaps are needed. Additionally, the `append/3` predicate is misused in the `bubblesort/3` clause, leading to incorrect accumulation of sorted elements. The test results confirm these logical flaws, as multiple incorrect sorted lists are produced. The code needs to be regenerated to correctly implement the bubblesort algorithm.",
