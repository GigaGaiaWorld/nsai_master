  "Report": "The code block implements the bubblesort algorithm correctly in terms of logic, but it depends on the `append/3` predicate, which is not defined. This causes the ProbLog interpreter to fail during execution. The `bubble_pass/3` predicate is correctly implemented to handle the swapping of elements during the bubble sort pass. The code block needs to be regenerated to include the definition of `append/3` or to modify the logic to avoid using `append/3`.",
