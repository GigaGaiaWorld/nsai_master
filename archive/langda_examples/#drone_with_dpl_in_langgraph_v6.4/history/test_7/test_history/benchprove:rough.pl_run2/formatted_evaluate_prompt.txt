System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
% member/2 for ProbLog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
% --------- Basic meta-interpreter ---------
% Prove "true" always succeeds
prove(true).
prove(Goal) :-
	% For all other goals, use the clause/2 facts/rules defined in the program
	clause(Goal, Body),
	prove(Body).
% Prove compound goal A,B: prove A first, then prove B
prove((A,B)) :-
	prove(A),
	prove(B).

.
% --------- Examples ---------- %
% Define some expand rules:
expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.
expand(square(X), Y) :- Y is X*X.
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, carol).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y).
% --------- Queries ---------- %
query(prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))).
query(prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))).
query(prove(expand(double(3),6))).
query(prove(includes([a,b,c],b))).
query(prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 1.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code demonstrates a basic meta-interpreter with some extended logic processing capabilities. While the syntax is generally correct, the implementation lacks several required predicates as specified in the requirements (e.g., `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, `refute/1`). The test results indicate that only the `implies/2` predicate is functioning correctly, while the other queries fail due to missing or incomplete implementations.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Missing Predicates**: The code does not implement `opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, and `refute/1` as required.
2. **Incorrect Implementation of `expand/2`**: The `expand/2` predicate is defined but not integrated into the `prove/1` meta-interpreter, causing the query `prove(expand(double(3),6))` to fail.
3. **Logical Gaps**: The `prove/1` meta-interpreter does not handle the extended predicates (`includes/2`, `extend/2`, etc.), leading to test failures.
4. **Integration Issues**: The `expand/2` predicate is defined but not used in the `prove/1` framework, resulting in no proof being generated for such queries.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "E553CC07",
        "Report": "The code block for `prove(implies(A, B))` is correctly implemented and matches the requirements. However, the other required predicates (`opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, `refute/1`) are missing. This causes the test results for these predicates to fail."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Implement Missing Predicates**: Add the missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, `refute/1`) to the extended logic processing section.
2. **Integrate `expand/2` into `prove/1`**: Modify the `prove/1` meta-interpreter to handle `expand/2` queries by adding a clause like `prove(expand(X, Y)) :- expand(X, Y).`
3. **Test Coverage**: Ensure all implemented predicates are tested with appropriate queries to verify their correctness.
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the purpose and usage of each predicate to avoid confusion in future development.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
