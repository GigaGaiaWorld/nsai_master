Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E553CC07", "Code": "prove(implies(A, B)) :- \n\tprove(A),\n\tprove(B)."}
```

Note: The generated_code section was empty in the provided input, so I've extracted the code block from the origin_code's <Langda> section as requested. This is the only code block that was marked with a <Langda> tag in the origin_code.
