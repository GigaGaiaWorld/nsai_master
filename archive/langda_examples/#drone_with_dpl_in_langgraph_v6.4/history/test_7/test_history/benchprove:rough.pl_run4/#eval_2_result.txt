  "Report": "The code block for `prove(implies(A, B))` is correctly implemented and works as expected, as evidenced by the successful test result for the implies query. However, it is part of a larger requirement set that includes other predicates (`opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, `refute/1`) which are missing. While this specific block doesn't need regeneration, the surrounding implementation is incomplete.",
