  "Report": "The `prove(implies(A, B))` predicate is correctly implemented and works as expected, as evidenced by the successful test result for `implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob))`. However, this code block is incomplete as it does not address the other required predicates (`opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, and `refute/1`). The current implementation is syntactically correct and logically sound for the `implies/2` case, but it fails to meet the full requirements specified.",
