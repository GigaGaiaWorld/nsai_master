Here are the reports for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
  "HASH": "47D659C8",
  "Report": "The bubblesort implementation is functionally correct as evidenced by the successful test case. However, there are several areas for improvement: 1) The bubble_pass/4 predicate uses disjunction which could lead to inefficiency with larger lists due to backtracking. 2) Variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., 'CurrentMax' instead of 'Max'). 3) The code lacks comments explaining the logic. While not strictly necessary, regeneration could improve readability and potential performance.",
  "Need_regenerate": true,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "N/A",
  "Report": "The forth_sort/2 predicate and query are correctly implemented and work as expected with the bubblesort implementation. The test case confirms proper integration and functionality. No regeneration is needed for this portion as it serves its purpose effectively and has no identified issues.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": ["47D659C8"]
}
```

Note: The second code block (forth_sort and query) depends on the first one (bubblesort implementation), but since we're only recommending regeneration for the first block, the dependency is noted but doesn't affect the regeneration decision for the second block.
