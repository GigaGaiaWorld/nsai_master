  "Report": "The code block contains a syntax error due to the use of the `->/2` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog. The logic for `bubblesort/3` and `bubble_pass/4` is written in standard Prolog style and does not align with ProbLog's syntax and semantics. The predicates need to be reimplemented using ProbLog-compatible constructs, such as `if-then-else` or probabilistic choices, to handle comparisons and sorting logic correctly.",

  "Report": "The `forth_sort/2` predicate and the query block are syntactically correct but fail to execute due to the issues in the `bubblesort/3` implementation. The query itself is valid, but the underlying sorting logic is broken. Once the `bubblesort/3` code block (HASH: 47D659C8) is regenerated, this block should work as intended.",
