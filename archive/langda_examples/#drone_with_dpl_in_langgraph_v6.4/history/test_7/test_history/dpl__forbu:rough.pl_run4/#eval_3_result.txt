{"HASH": "47D659C8","Report": "The code block contains a syntax error in the `bubble_pass` predicate where the `->/2` operator is used, which is not supported in ProbLog. Additionally, the `bubble_pass` predicate does not correctly accumulate the sorted elements, leading to logical inconsistencies in the sorting process. The `bubblesort` predicate also fails to correctly implement the bubblesort algorithm due to these issues.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The `forth_sort` predicate is syntactically correct but relies on the flawed `bubblesort` implementation. Since the `bubblesort` predicate needs regeneration, this predicate will also need to be updated to work with the corrected version.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["47D659C8"]}
