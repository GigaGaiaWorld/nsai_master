System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

</Code>
<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here
```
</Final_Answer>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

% Interpretable Bubble Sort in ProbLog

% Base case: If the list is empty, return the accumulator
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).

% Recursive case: Perform a pass of bubble sort
bubblesort([H|T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    % Perform a single pass to bubble the largest element to the end
    bubble_pass([H|T], [], NewList, Max),
    % Accumulate the largest element and recurse on the remaining list
    bubblesort(NewList, [Max|Acc], Sorted).

% Base case for bubble_pass: If the list has one element, return it as Max
bubble_pass([X], Acc, Acc, X).

% Recursive case for bubble_pass: Compare and swap adjacent elements
bubble_pass([X,Y|T], Acc, NewList, Max) :-
    (X > Y) ->
        bubble_pass([X|T], [Y|Acc], NewList, Max);
        bubble_pass([Y|T], [X|Acc], NewList, Max).

% Query to test the bubblesort algorithm
query(bubblesort([3,1,2,5,7,12], [], X)).

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
