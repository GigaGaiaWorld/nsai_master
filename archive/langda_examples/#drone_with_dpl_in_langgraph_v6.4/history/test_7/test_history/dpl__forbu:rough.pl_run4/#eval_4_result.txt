  "Report": "The `bubblesort/3` and `bubble_pass/4` predicates are logically correct for Prolog but contain syntax incompatible with ProbLog. Specifically, the `->/2` operator in `bubble_pass/4` is not supported in ProbLog, causing a syntax error. The code needs to be regenerated to replace the conditional operator with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., separate clauses for `X > Y` and `X =< Y` cases). The sorting algorithm itself is correctly implemented for Prolog but requires adaptation for ProbLog.",
