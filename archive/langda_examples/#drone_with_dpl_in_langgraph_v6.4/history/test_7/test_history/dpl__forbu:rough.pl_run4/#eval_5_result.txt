The bubble_pass/4 predicate handles the sorting logic accurately but could benefit from stylistic improvements and documentation. The use of =< is technically correct but less common than =< in Prolog. The code meets all requirements and functions as intended, so regeneration is not strictly necessary. However, minor optimizations and style improvements could be considered.",
