Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5BCD04E8", "Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,Old),\n goal(GP),\n Old \\= GP,\n use_actuator(Time,A),\n actuator_strength(A,AS),\n sign(GP-Old,Sign),\n AE is Sign * AS,\n wind_effect(Time,WE),\n Pos is Old + AE + WE."}
```

This code block implements all the requirements specified in the <Langda> section:
1. Gets the previous flap position (Old)
2. Checks if Old is already the target (Old \= GP)
3. Selects an actuator (use_actuator)
4. Gets the actuator strength (actuator_strength)
5. Uses the goal position (GP = 4)
6. Calculates ideal movement (AE)
7. Gets wind effect (WE)
8. Computes new position (Pos) by combining Old, AE, and WE
