{"HASH": "5BCD04E8","Report": "The code block implements the logic for calculating the attempted flap position based on actuator strength and wind effects. However, it relies on the `sign/2` predicate, which is not defined in the code. This predicate is crucial for determining the direction of movement (left or right) based on the difference between the goal position and the current position. Without it, the code cannot proceed beyond this point. The block should be regenerated to include the missing predicate or its functionality.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
