Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is mostly correct but contains some inconsistencies with the original code. The main issues are: 1) The Spanish house's pet is incorrectly placed in the last field instead of the third. 2) The snail and winstons are incorrectly placed in the last and fourth fields respectively. 3) The positions of drinks and smokes are swapped in some clauses. Despite these issues, the generated code still produces a valid solution to the zebra puzzle, though the internal representation differs from the original.
