Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the rock-paper-scissors game rules and calculate the winner based on the moves provided. The generated code simplifies the play predicate by directly incorporating the win, lose, and draw conditions within separate clauses, which is a valid approach. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their functional equivalence.
