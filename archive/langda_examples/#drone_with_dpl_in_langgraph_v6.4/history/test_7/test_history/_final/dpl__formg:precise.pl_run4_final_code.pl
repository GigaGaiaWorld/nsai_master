The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same correct result for the merge sort operation. The logic and structure of the merge_sort, split_list, merge, and append predicates remain consistent. However, the generated code has some formatting inconsistencies, such as irregular line breaks and spacing, which do not affect functionality but reduce readability.
