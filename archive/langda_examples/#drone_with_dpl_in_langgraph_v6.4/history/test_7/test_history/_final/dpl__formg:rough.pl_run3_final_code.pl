The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm and produce the same sorted result for the given input. The generated code uses a different approach for splitting the list, which is more concise and efficient. The 'split' predicate in the generated code directly divides the list into two parts by taking elements alternately, whereas the original code calculates the length and splits the list accordingly. Both versions correctly handle the base cases and merging process. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements.
