***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code is incorrect and does not meet expectations. It contains syntax errors, specifically an unmatched character '(' at line 4, which prevents it from being valid Problog code. Additionally, the generated code is incomplete and lacks several constraints present in the original code, such as the conditions for the zebra puzzle. The original code successfully solves the puzzle, while the generated code fails to execute due to syntax errors.
