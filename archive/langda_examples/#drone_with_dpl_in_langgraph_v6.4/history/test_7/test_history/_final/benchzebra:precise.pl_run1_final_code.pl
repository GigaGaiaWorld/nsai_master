***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code has several issues. First, the positions of some attributes in the house predicates are incorrect (e.g., 'dog' and 'fox' are in the wrong positions). Second, the generated code has a syntax error with an unexpected line break after 'houses(Houses),'. Third, the generated code results in a timeout error when executed, indicating it does not produce a valid solution. The original code, on the other hand, runs successfully and produces the correct result.
