  "Report": "The `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate correctly implements the movement logic but has the following issues: 1) The decreasing probability of reaching the goal suggests inefficient movement due to wind disturbances. 2) The wind effect (`WE`) is added after the ideal movement (`AE`), which may amplify deviations. 3) The actuator selection is random (50/50) without considering the goal proximity. Recommendations: 1) Adjust actuator selection probabilities based on distance to goal. 2) Modify wind effect application to minimize oscillations. 3) Prioritize movements that directly reduce distance to goal.",
