<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The code is syntactically valid and implements the core logic of the aircraft flap controller as described in the requirements. The test results show that the system is functioning, with probabilities for `goal_reached` decreasing over time, which is expected as the system attempts to reach the goal position. However, the probabilities for `overrun_exception` are consistently zero, which may indicate an issue with the logic for detecting overruns or an edge case not being tested.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Overrun Detection Issue**: The `overrun_exception` probabilities are zero, suggesting the logic for detecting illegal flap positions is not triggering correctly. This could be due to the `legal_flap_position` check in the `attempted_flap_position` rule, which ensures `Pos` is legal before it is assigned, preventing overruns from being recorded.
2. **Wind Effect Application**: The wind effect is applied after calculating the intermediate position, but the requirements specify that the wind disturbance should be added to the old position. This discrepancy might affect the accuracy of the movement simulation.
3. **Goal Reached Probabilities**: The decreasing probabilities for `goal_reached` are expected, but the values seem low, which might indicate inefficiencies in the movement logic or wind effect handling.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "5BCD04E8",
        "Report": "The code block correctly implements the movement logic, including actuator selection, strength application, and wind effect addition. However, the wind effect is applied after calculating the intermediate position, which deviates from the requirements. Additionally, the `legal_flap_position` check ensures `Pos` is always legal, preventing `overrun_exception` from being triggered. This check should be moved to the `flap_position` rule to allow overruns to be detected."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Overrun Detection**: Move the `legal_flap_position` check from the `attempted_flap_position` rule to the `flap_position` rule. This will allow the system to detect and record overruns when illegal positions are attempted.
2. **Adjust Wind Effect Application**: Modify the `attempted_flap_position` rule to apply the wind effect directly to the old position before calculating the intermediate position, as specified in the requirements.
3. **Review Movement Logic**: Ensure the movement logic (e.g., actuator strength and direction) is correctly implemented to maximize the probability of reaching the goal efficiently.
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Add test cases where the initial position is close to the boundaries (0 or 10) to verify the robustness of the overrun detection and movement logic.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
