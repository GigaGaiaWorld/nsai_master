  "Report": "The code block for `attempted_flap_position/2` is syntactically correct and implements the core requirements, but the decreasing probability of `goal_reached` in the test results indicates potential logical issues. The main concerns are: (1) Wind effect integration may not fully align with requirements (should subtract ideal movement before adding wind disturbance), (2) The min/max clamping might mask movement calculation errors, and (3) Equal actuator selection probability may not optimize movement. The block should be regenerated to refine the position calculation logic and better handle wind effects.",
