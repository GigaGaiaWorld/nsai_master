  "Report": "The code block for `attempted_flap_position` has the following issues: 1) It adds the wind effect (`WE`) directly to `Old + AE` without ensuring the intermediate position (`Old + AE`) is legal, which can lead to illegal positions and `overrun_exception`. 2) The code snippet is syntactically incomplete, missing the closing parenthesis and period. 3) The logic does not effectively converge toward the goal, as evidenced by decreasing `goal_reached` probabilities over time. Recommendations: 1) Revise the movement logic to ensure `Old + AE` is legal before adding `WE`. 2) Add boundary checks to clamp `Pos` within the legal range (0 to 10). 3) Complete the syntax by adding the missing closing parenthesis and period.",
