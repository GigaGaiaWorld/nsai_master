Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5BCD04E8", "Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev, Old),\n goal(GP),\n Old \\= GP,\n use_actuator(Time, A),\n actuator_strength(A, AS),\n AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,\n wind_effect(Time, WE),\n Pos is Old + AE + WE."}
```

This code block implements all the requirements specified in the <Langda> section:
1. Gets the previous flap position (Old)
2. Checks if Old is already the target position (Old \= GP)
3. Randomly selects an actuator (use_actuator)
4. Gets the actuator strength (actuator_strength)
5. Uses the goal position (GP = 4)
6. Calculates the ideal movement (AE)
7. Gets wind disturbance (wind_effect)
8. Calculates the new position (Pos) by combining Old, AE, and WE
