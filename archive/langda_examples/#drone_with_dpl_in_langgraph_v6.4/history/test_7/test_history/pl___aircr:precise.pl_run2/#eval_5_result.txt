  "Report": "The code block implements the core movement logic correctly but has two main issues: (1) The wind effect is applied after calculating the intermediate position, which deviates from the requirements (wind should be added to Old directly). (2) The `legal_flap_position` check in this rule prevents `overrun_exception` from being triggered, as it filters out illegal positions before they can be detected. The block needs regeneration to align with requirements and fix overrun detection. The movement logic (actuator selection, strength application) is correct and should be preserved.",
