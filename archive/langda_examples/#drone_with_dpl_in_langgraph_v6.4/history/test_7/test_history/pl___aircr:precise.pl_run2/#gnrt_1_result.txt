Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "5BCD04E8", "Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev, Old),\n goal(GP),\n Old \\= GP,\n use_actuator(Time, A),\n actuator_strength(A, AS),\n AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,\n wind_effect(Time, WE),\n Intermediate is Old + AE,\n legal_flap_position(Intermediate),\n Pos is min(10, max(0, Intermediate + WE))."}
```

This JSON object contains:
1. The original hash "5BCD04E8" from the `<HASH>` tag
2. The completed code block from `<generated_code>` that addresses the issues mentioned in the `<Report>`, including:
   - Checking if the intermediate position (Old + AE) is legal
   - Adding boundary checks with min/max to ensure Pos stays within 0-10
   - Properly formatted with all required syntax (closing parenthesis and period)
