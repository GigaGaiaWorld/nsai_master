  "Report": "The code block calculates the attempted flap position by considering actuator strength, wind effects, and the goal position. However, it fails to handle non-integer values resulting from wind effects, which violates the `legal_flap_position/1` constraint. The wind effect is scaled by 0.5, introducing non-integer values, and the `min`/`max` functions do not resolve the type mismatch. Additionally, the code does not explicitly validate the goal position or ensure integer outputs for `between/3`.",
