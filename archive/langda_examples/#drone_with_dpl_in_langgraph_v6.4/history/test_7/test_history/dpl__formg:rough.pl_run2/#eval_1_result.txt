  "Report": "The merge sort implementation is logically correct and adheres to the requirements. The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` are well-defined and work together to sort the list. However, the `query/1` call is redundant as it appears both inside and outside the main code block. The code block does not require regeneration as the core logic is sound, but minor cleanup (removing the redundant `query/1` call) is recommended for clarity.",
