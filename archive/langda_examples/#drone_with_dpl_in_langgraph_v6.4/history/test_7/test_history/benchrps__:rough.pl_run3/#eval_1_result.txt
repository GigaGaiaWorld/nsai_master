  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the game rules and round-playing logic for rock-paper-scissors. It adheres to the requirements and passes the test case. The only improvement needed is adding comments to explain the recursive nature of the `play` predicate. No logical or syntax errors were found.",

{
  "HASH": "N/A (for the second block)",
  "Report": "The second code block (containing `compute_score` and `determine_winner`) functions correctly but could benefit from optimization and documentation. The `compute_score` predicate could be made more concise, and both predicates would benefit from explanatory comments. However, these are style improvements rather than functional requirements, so regeneration isn't strictly necessary.",
