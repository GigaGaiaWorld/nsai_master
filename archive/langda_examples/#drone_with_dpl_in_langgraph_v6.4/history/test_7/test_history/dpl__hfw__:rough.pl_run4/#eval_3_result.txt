  "Report": "The code block implements a recursive expression evaluator but contains several critical issues. The `parse_add_sub_tail` predicate incorrectly processes remaining expressions by not properly handling nested operations, leading to incorrect evaluation results. The `parse_mul_div` predicate fails to propagate division results correctly and lacks proper handling of division by zero. Additionally, the integration with `detect_all` is flawed, causing mismatched symbol processing. The test result shows a failure (0.0000 output) for a valid expression, confirming these issues.",
