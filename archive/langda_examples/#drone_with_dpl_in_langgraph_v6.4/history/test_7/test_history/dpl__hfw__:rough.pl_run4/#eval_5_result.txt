  "Report": "The code block contains logical flaws in the implementation of the recursive expression evaluator. Key issues include:\n1. `parse_add_sub_tail` fails to correctly accumulate intermediate results during expression evaluation\n2. `parse_mul_div` doesn't properly handle division operations and result propagation\n3. The recursive logic doesn't correctly process operator precedence\n4. The test result shows incorrect output (0.0000) for a valid expression\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Redesign the recursive evaluation logic to properly handle operator precedence\n2. Ensure arithmetic operations correctly propagate their results\n3. Add proper error handling for division by zero\n4. Verify the integration with `detect_all` predicate\n5. Consider adding intermediate predicates for better structure",
