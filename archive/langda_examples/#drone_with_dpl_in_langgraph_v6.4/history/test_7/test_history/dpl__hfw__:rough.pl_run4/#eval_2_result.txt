  "Report": "The code block implements a recursive expression evaluator but contains several logical errors. The main issues are: 1) Unbound variable 'Left' in parse_add_sub_tail, leading to incorrect calculations; 2) Improper handling of operator precedence, particularly for nested operations; 3) Division operation fails to propagate results correctly. The test result shows incorrect output (0.0000) for a valid arithmetic expression, confirming these issues. The syntax is correct but the logic fails to meet requirements.",
