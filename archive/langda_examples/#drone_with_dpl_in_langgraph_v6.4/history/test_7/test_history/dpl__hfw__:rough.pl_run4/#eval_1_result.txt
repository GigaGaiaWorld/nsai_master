  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate has significant logical flaws. It processes operations left-to-right without respecting operator precedence (e.g., multiplication/division should take precedence over addition/subtraction). This leads to incorrect evaluation of arithmetic expressions. Additionally, it lacks error handling for edge cases like division by zero. The test result (0.0000) confirms the failure to evaluate the expression correctly. The predicate needs to be redesigned to implement proper operator precedence and error handling.",
