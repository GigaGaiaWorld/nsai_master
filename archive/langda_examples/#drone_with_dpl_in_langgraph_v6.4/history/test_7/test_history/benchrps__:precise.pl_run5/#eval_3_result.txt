  "Report": "The `determine_winner/3` rule is logically structured but has critical issues: (1) It calls the undefined predicate `valid_moves/1`, causing a runtime error. (2) The rule is syntactically split into two parts in the original code, which is incorrect. The second part should be merged into the first to form a single cohesive rule. (3) While the scoring logic (using `compute_score/2`) is correct, the rule lacks proper input validation beyond the missing `valid_moves/1`. Recommendations: (1) Define `valid_moves/1` to check if all elements in the input lists are valid moves (rock, paper, or scissor). (2) Merge the split rule into one. (3) Add error handling for invalid moves in `result/3`.",
