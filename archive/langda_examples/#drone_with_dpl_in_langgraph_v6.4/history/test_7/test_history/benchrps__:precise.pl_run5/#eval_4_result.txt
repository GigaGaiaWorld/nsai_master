  "Report": "The `valid_moves` predicate is correctly defined to validate a list of moves, but it is not integrated into the main logic. This could lead to invalid moves being processed, causing undefined behavior. The predicate itself is syntactically correct and logically sound for its purpose, but its isolation from the main workflow is problematic. It should be called before `play/3` to ensure move validity.",
