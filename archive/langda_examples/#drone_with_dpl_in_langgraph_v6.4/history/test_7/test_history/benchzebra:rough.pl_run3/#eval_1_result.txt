  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is syntactically correct but incomplete in the context of the zebra puzzle. It enforces that the house with yellow color has Kools cigarettes, but it lacks additional constraints or clues that are necessary to fully solve the puzzle. This could lead to ambiguity or inefficiency in the solver. The timeout error in the test results suggests that the solver may be struggling due to incomplete or inefficient constraints.",
