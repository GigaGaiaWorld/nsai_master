  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is syntactically correct and logically valid for the zebra puzzle. However, it is part of an incomplete `zebra` predicate, which causes the overall program to fail. The block itself does not need regeneration, but the surrounding context (missing commas/parentheses and other constraints) must be fixed. The timeout error is likely due to the incomplete predicate structure rather than this specific block.",
