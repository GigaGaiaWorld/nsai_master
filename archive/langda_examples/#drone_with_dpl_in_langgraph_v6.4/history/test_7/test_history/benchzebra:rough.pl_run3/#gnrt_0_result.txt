Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the completed code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code appears between two existing predicates and has a hash tag of 0F506A43. In the generated_code, this corresponds to the completed "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)" predicate.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```
