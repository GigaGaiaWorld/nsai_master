  "Report": "The `bubblesort` predicate is correctly implemented to recursively call itself on the remaining list `L2` and prepend the current maximum value `X` to the sorted part `[X|L3]`. The test result confirms its functionality. However, the predicate could be more explicit about handling edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with a single element. Adding comments or explicit clauses for these cases would improve readability and robustness.",

  "Report": "The `swap` predicate is logically correct and determines whether to swap two elements based on their values. It handles equality correctly by not swapping. The predicate is simple and effective, but could benefit from a comment explaining its purpose. No regeneration is needed as it meets all requirements and works correctly in all tested scenarios.",
