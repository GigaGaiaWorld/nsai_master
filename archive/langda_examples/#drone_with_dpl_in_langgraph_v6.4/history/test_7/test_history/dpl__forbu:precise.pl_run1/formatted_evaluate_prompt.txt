System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
 swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
 swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):-
 hole(H1,H2,X1,X2),
 bubble([X2|T],T1,X).
bubblesort([],L,L).
bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :- 
  bubble(L,L2,X),
  bubblesort(L2,[X|L3],Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 2971FD2F </HASH>
<Requirements>Recursively call bubblesort on L2 and put the current maximum value X into the sorted part [X|L3]. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>swap(X,Y,swap) :- X > Y.
swap(X,Y,no_swap) :- X =< Y.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 5CBF7C6A </HASH>
<Requirements>The logical predicate that determines whether to exchange </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```
</Final_Answer>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Result> Here are the testing result of code:

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The code appears to be syntactically valid and logically correct for the most part. The test result shows that the `forth_sort` predicate successfully sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating that the sorting logic works as intended. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and potential edge cases that need to be addressed." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No major errors were identified in the code. The test result confirms that the sorting logic is correct. However, the code could be improved for readability and robustness, especially for edge cases like empty lists or lists with duplicate elements." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "2971FD2F",
        "Report": "The `bubblesort` predicate is correctly implemented to recursively call itself on the remaining list `L2` and prepend the current maximum value `X` to the sorted part `[X|L3]`. However, the predicate could be more explicit about handling edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with a single element."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "5CBF7C6A",
        "Report": "The `swap` predicate is logically correct and determines whether to swap two elements based on their values. However, the predicate could be optimized or clarified for cases where `X` and `Y` are equal (though the current implementation handles it correctly by not swapping)."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Add explicit handling for edge cases in the `bubblesort` predicate (e.g., empty lists or single-element lists). 2. Consider adding comments to clarify the logic, especially for the `swap` predicate. 3. Test the code with additional edge cases, such as lists with duplicate elements or already sorted lists, to ensure robustness." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
