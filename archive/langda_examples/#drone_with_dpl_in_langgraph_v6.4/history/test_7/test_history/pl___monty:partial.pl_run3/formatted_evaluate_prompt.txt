<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code implements the Monty Hall problem in ProbLog, and the test results align with the expected probabilities for the problem (1/3 for `win_keep` and 2/3 for `win_switch`). However, there are syntax and logical issues in the code that need to be addressed to ensure correctness and clarity. The code blocks are mostly logically correct but could be improved for robustness and readability.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Error**: The `open_door` predicate is split into two parts without proper separation, leading to potential parsing issues.
2. **Logical Redundancy**: The `member/2` predicate is defined twice, which is unnecessary and could cause confusion.
3. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `win_switch` predicate lacks clarity in its implementation and could be more explicitly defined.
4. **Integration Issue**: The `open_door` predicates are not seamlessly integrated, which could lead to unexpected behavior in edge cases.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "C5B4A895",
        "Report": "This code block correctly implements the requirement to randomly open one of the unselected doors when both are empty. However, the syntax is split awkwardly in the original code, which could cause parsing errors. The logic itself is sound, but the implementation could be more concise by directly using the `member/2` predicate without redefining it."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "338175EC",
        "Report": "This block correctly implements the requirement to open the door without a prize when one unselected door has a prize. However, the predicate is split in the original code, which is syntactically incorrect. The logic is correct but could be simplified for readability."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "B73E5085",
        "Report": "This block correctly defines the `win_keep` condition, which checks if the originally selected door has the prize. The implementation is straightforward and meets the requirements."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax**: Combine the `open_door` predicates into a single block and ensure proper separation between clauses.
2. **Remove Redundancy**: Remove the duplicate definition of the `member/2` predicate.
3. **Clarify `win_switch`**: Explicitly define the `win_switch` predicate to make it clearer how it checks for the prize behind the unselected and unopened door.
4. **Improve Integration**: Ensure the `open_door` predicates are integrated seamlessly to handle all edge cases, such as when only one unselected door is empty.
5. **Add Comments**: Include comments to explain the logic for each predicate, especially for complex conditions like `open_door`.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
