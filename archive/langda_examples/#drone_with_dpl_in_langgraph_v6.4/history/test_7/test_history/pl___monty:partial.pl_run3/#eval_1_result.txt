Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
  "HASH": "C5B4A895",
  "Report": "This code block correctly implements the requirement to randomly open one of the unselected doors when both are empty. The logic is sound, but the syntax is split awkwardly in the original code, which could cause parsing errors. The implementation could be more concise by directly using the `member/2` predicate without redefining it. No regeneration is needed for the logic, but the syntax should be fixed in the integration phase.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "338175EC",
  "Report": "This block correctly implements the requirement to open the door without a prize when one unselected door has a prize. The logic is correct, but the predicate is split in the original code, which is syntactically incorrect. The implementation could be simplified for readability. No regeneration is needed for the logic, but the syntax should be fixed in the integration phase.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "B73E5085",
  "Report": "This block correctly defines the `win_keep` condition, which checks if the originally selected door has the prize. The implementation is straightforward and meets the requirements. No issues were found, and regeneration is not needed.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

### Summary:
- None of the code blocks require regeneration as their logic is correct and meets the requirements.
- The main issues are syntactic (split predicates) and integration-related, which should be addressed when combining the code blocks into a complete program.
- The `member/2` predicate redundancy should be removed in the final integration.
