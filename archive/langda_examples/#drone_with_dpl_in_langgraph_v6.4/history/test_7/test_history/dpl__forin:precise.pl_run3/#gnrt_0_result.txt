Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "DA97FB01", "Code": "insertion_sort(T, SortedT), insert_element(H, SortedT, Sorted)."}
```

This is the completed code snippet that fulfills the requirements specified in the <Langda> block:
1. It recursively sorts the tail list (T) into SortedT
2. It inserts the head element H into the sorted list (SortedT) to produce the final Sorted list

The code uses the already defined insert_element predicate to handle the insertion part of the insertion sort algorithm.
