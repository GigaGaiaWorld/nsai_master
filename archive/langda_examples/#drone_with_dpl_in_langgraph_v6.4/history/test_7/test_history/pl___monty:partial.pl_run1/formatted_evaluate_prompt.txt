<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code implements the Monty Hall problem in ProbLog, and the test results align with the expected probabilities for the problem (1/3 for winning by keeping the original choice and 2/3 for winning by switching). However, there are minor syntactic and logical issues in the code that could lead to confusion or errors in more complex scenarios. The overall quality is good, but improvements are needed for robustness and clarity.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Issue**: The `open_door` predicate is split into two parts without proper separation, which could cause parsing errors.
2. **Logical Issue**: The `win_switch` rule lacks clarity in its implementation, making it harder to verify its correctness.
3. **Integration Issue**: The `open_door` rules are not explicitly linked to the `win_switch` rule, which could lead to misinterpretation of the logic.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "C5B4A895",
        "Report": "This code block correctly implements the requirement to randomly open one of the two unselected doors when both are empty. However, the syntax is split awkwardly in the original code, which could cause parsing issues. The logic itself is sound."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "338175EC",
        "Report": "This code block correctly implements the requirement to open the door without a prize when one unselected door has a prize. The logic is accurate, but the predicate is split in the original code, which could lead to confusion."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "B73E5085",
        "Report": "This code block correctly defines the winning condition for keeping the original door. The implementation is straightforward and matches the requirement."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax**: Combine the `open_door` predicates into a single block to avoid parsing issues. For example:
   


2. **Clarify `win_switch`**: Rewrite the `win_switch` rule for better readability and to ensure it explicitly depends on the `open_door` predicate. For example:
   


3. **Add Comments**: Include comments to explain the logic of each predicate, especially for the `open_door` and `win_switch` rules, to improve maintainability.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
