Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
  "HASH": "C5B4A895",
  "Report": "This code block correctly implements the requirement to randomly open one of two unselected empty doors. The logic is sound and matches the Monty Hall problem specifications. The only issue is the awkward split in the original code's syntax, but this doesn't affect the block's functionality. No regeneration is needed for the logic itself, though the parent file should be adjusted to properly integrate it.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "338175EC",
  "Report": "This block correctly implements the deterministic door opening when one unselected door has a prize. The logic is accurate and fulfills the requirement. Like the previous block, its only issue is the split predicate in the original file. The block itself doesn't need regeneration as its implementation is correct.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "B73E5085",
  "Report": "This block perfectly implements the win condition for keeping the original door. The implementation is simple, correct, and matches the requirement exactly. No issues were found, and no regeneration is needed.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

Note: While none of the individual code blocks need regeneration, the overall file structure needs adjustment to:
1. Properly combine the split `open_door` predicates
2. Improve the `win_switch` implementation for clarity
3. Add comments for better maintainability

These are file-level rather than block-level issues, so the individual blocks can remain as they are.
