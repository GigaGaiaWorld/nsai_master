Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    (   length(Stack, L), L >= 3 ->\n        get_top_n(Stack, 3, [X,Y,Z], Rest),\n        sort([X,Y,Z], [A,B,C]),\n        append([A,B,C], Rest, SortedStack)\n    ;   SortedStack = Stack  % Handle cases where stack has fewer than 3 elements\n    )."}
```

This JSON contains:
1. The same HASH value from the original report (6931D64E)
2. The completed code for the sort operation, which now includes:
   - A check for stack length
   - Proper handling of cases with fewer than 3 elements
   - The sorting logic for the top 3 elements
   - The append operation to reconstruct the stack
