Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    get_top_n(Stack, 3, [X,Y,Z], Rest),\n    sort([X,Y,Z], [A,B,C]),\n    append([A,B,C], Rest, SortedStack)."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with `<langda>` in the original code, and it has been completed in the generated code. The hash value is preserved from the original report.
