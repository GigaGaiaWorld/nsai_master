System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The `sort` operation is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality. The predicate `get_top_n` is used to extract the top three elements, but the sorting logic is missing. Additionally, the predicate does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than three elements, which could cause the `append` operation to fail. The requirement to sort the top three elements in ascending order is not fully implemented. The code block needs to be regenerated to include proper sorting logic and error handling for stacks with fewer than three elements.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
