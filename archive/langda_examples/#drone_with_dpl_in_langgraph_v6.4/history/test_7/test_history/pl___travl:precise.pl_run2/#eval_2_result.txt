  "Report": "The code block `0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).` only implements the initial infection probability (0.1) but does not integrate the additional probabilities for contact transmission (0.6 or 0.8, depending on susceptibility) and travel risk (0.2). This results in an incomplete implementation of the infection model. The test results confirm this, showing only the initial infection probabilities (0.01 for each person). To fully implement the requirements, the code block needs to be regenerated to include logic for contact transmission and travel risk.",
