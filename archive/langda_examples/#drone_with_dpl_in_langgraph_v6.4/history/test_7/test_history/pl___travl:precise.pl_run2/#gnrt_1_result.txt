Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the <generated_code> that correspond to the <langda> block in the <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X)."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X)."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X)."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

Note: All code blocks share the same HASH "E09B4F54" as they all address the same original incomplete code block and its requirements. The backslash in `\+susceptible(X)` has been escaped as `\\+susceptible(X)` for proper JSON formatting.
