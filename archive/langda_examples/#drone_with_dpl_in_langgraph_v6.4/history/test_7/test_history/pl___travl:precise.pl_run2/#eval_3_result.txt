{"HASH": "E09B4F54","Report": "The code block implements the `inf/1` predicate with four rules that correctly reflect the requirements for initial infection (0.1), contact transmission (0.6 for non-susceptible, 0.8 for susceptible), and risky travel (0.2). However, the test results show unexpectedly low probabilities (0.0316), indicating that the rules are not combining probabilities as intended. The issue appears to be with how ProbLog handles multiple probabilistic rules for the same predicate, rather than with the individual rules themselves. The code block does not need regeneration, but the overall program structure needs adjustment to properly combine probabilities.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
