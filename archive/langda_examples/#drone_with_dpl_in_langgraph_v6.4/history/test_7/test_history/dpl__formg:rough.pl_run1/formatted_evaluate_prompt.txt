System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>% Merge Sort in ProbLog

% Base case: empty list or single element
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).

% Recursive case: split the list, sort the halves, and merge them
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

% Split the list into two halves
split([], [], []).
split([X], [X], []).
split([X, Y | Tail], [X | Left], [Y | Right]) :-
    split(Tail, Left, Right).

% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X | LeftTail], [Y | RightTail], [X | Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(LeftTail, [Y | RightTail], Merged).
merge([X | LeftTail], [Y | RightTail], [Y | Merged]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X | LeftTail], RightTail, Merged).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 418D2062 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable merge_sort/2 algorithm </Requirements></Langda>
.
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The provided ProbLog code for merge sort is syntactically correct and logically implements the merge sort algorithm as specified. The test result confirms that the code successfully sorts the input list [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12] into [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] with a probability of 1.0000, indicating correct functionality. However, there are minor issues related to code organization and potential edge cases that could be addressed for robustness." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No critical errors were identified in the code. The test results confirm the correctness of the implementation. However, the code could be improved for clarity and to handle edge cases more explicitly." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "418D2062",
        "Report": "The merge_sort/2 predicate is correctly implemented with base cases for empty and single-element lists, and the recursive case splits the list, sorts the halves, and merges them. The split/3 and merge/3 predicates are also correctly implemented. However, the code could benefit from comments explaining the logic for better readability. Additionally, the merge/3 predicate assumes the input lists are sorted, which is not explicitly enforced in the code."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The append/3 predicate and query/1 predicate are not part of the original merge sort implementation and seem to be included for testing purposes. While they do not affect the functionality of the merge sort, their presence in the codebase without context could be confusing. It would be better to separate test cases from the core implementation."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Add comments to clarify the logic of the merge_sort/2, split/3, and merge/3 predicates. 2. Explicitly document the assumption that the input lists to merge/3 must be sorted. 3. Separate test cases (e.g., the append/3 predicate and query/1) from the core implementation for better code organization. 4. Consider adding edge case tests (e.g., lists with duplicate elements or already sorted lists) to ensure robustness." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
