  "Report": "The merge_sort/2 predicate is correctly implemented with base cases for empty and single-element lists, and the recursive case splits the list, sorts the halves, and merges them. The split/3 and merge/3 predicates are also correctly implemented. However, the code could benefit from comments explaining the logic for better readability. Additionally, the merge/3 predicate assumes the input lists are sorted, which is not explicitly enforced in the code. The test results confirm the functionality is correct, so regeneration is not strictly necessary but could be considered for improved documentation and robustness.",

  "Report": "The append/3 predicate and query/1 predicate are not part of the original merge sort implementation and seem to be included for testing purposes. While they do not affect the functionality of the merge sort, their presence in the codebase without context could be confusing. It would be better to separate test cases from the core implementation. Since these are auxiliary and not part of the main requirements, regeneration is not needed, but they should be moved to a separate test file.",
