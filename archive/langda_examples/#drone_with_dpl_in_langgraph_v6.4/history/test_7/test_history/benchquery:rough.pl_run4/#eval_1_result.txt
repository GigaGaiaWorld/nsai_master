### Key Observations:
1. The `density` predicate (HASH: 5738285A) is correct and should not be regenerated.
2. The database facts are correct and should not be regenerated.
3. The query logic (`query(query_pop(_))`) is invalid and must be regenerated. It depends on the `density` predicate to work.
4. A new predicate (`query_pop`) must be implemented to compare densities and filter results within 5%. This was not present in the original code.
