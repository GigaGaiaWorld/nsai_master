Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in JSON format:

```report
{
  "HASH": "99C92279",
  "Report": "The `implies(P,Q)` predicate correctly implements the logical implication (P â‡’ Q) by succeeding when P is unprovable or Q is provable. The implementation using `(\\+ prove(P); prove(Q))` is both concise and logically accurate. Test results confirm it works as expected. No issues found.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "1405B337",
  "Report": "The `opposite(P)` predicate correctly implements negation-as-failure by succeeding when P is unprovable (`\\+ prove(P)`). This matches standard Prolog negation semantics and passes all tests. No issues found.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "C68F7B35",
  "Report": "The `extend(List,Elem,Extended)` predicate correctly implements list extension by prepending Elem to List. The unification (`Extended = [Elem|List]`) is efficient and matches requirements. Test results confirm correctness. No issues found.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "0F69CE0F",
  "Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` predicate correctly performs arithmetic expansion (Y is X*2). The use of `is` ensures proper evaluation. While it works for valid numeric inputs, consider adding type-checking for robustness. However, current implementation meets requirements and passes tests.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

### Summary:
- No code blocks require regeneration as all implementations:
  1. Are syntactically correct
  2. Fulfill their specified requirements
  3. Pass all test cases
  4. Have no critical dependencies
- Minor improvements (like edge-case handling) are recommended but don't necessitate regeneration.
