  "Report": "The second code block contains the `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates. While the `compute_score/2` logic is correct, the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails due to the missing `play/3` predicate. The logic for determining the winner is sound but cannot execute without the missing predicate. This block needs regeneration to include the `play/3` predicate or to be restructured to work without it.",
