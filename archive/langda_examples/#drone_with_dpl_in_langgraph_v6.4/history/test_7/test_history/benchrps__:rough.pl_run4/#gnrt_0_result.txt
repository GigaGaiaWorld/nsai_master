Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. The <Langda> section was about defining the game rules of rock-paper-scissors, which in the generated_code appears to be the basic move and beats predicates at the top.

Here's the formatted JSON response:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E","Code": "move(rock).\nmove(paper).\nmove(scissor).\nbeats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(scissor, paper).\nbeats(paper, rock)."}
```

Note that this is the only code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code, as the other parts of the code were already complete in the origin_code and didn't need to be generated. The hash tag CFA63C1E was provided in the <Langda> section of the origin_code.
