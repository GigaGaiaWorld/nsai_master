Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "0C388A60", "Report": "The code block defines `move(paper).` correctly, fulfilling the requirement. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Report": "The code block defines `move(scissor).` with a typo. It should be `move(scissors).` for consistency with the game's standard terminology. This affects readability and could cause confusion in larger implementations.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["58D60F5E"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "59C3D0D4", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(paper, rock).` correctly, fulfilling the requirement. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(scissor, paper).` with the same typo (`scissor` instead of `scissors`). This should be corrected for consistency with standard terminology and to match the corrected move definition.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["BF964057"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "94C4D48B", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` predicate for the `lose` case correctly, decrementing the score. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "026B015E", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` predicate for the `draw` case correctly, leaving the score unchanged. While logically correct, this could be documented for clarity. Regeneration is optional but not strictly necessary.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

### Key Observations:
1. The main issues are the typo in `scissor` (should be `scissors`) which affects two code blocks (`BF964057` and `58D60F5E`). These are marked for regeneration and are interdependent.
2. The other code blocks are correct and do not require regeneration.
3. No test failures were reported for any of these blocks, but the typo could cause issues in future extensions or integrations.
