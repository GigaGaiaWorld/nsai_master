System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>% Define the append/3 predicate for list concatenation
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L, [H|R]) :-
    append(T, L, R).

% Bubblesort implementation
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).

bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped = true,
     bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
     append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).

bubble_pass([], [], false).

bubble_pass([X, Y | Rest], [Y | NewRest], true) :-
    X > Y,
    bubble_pass([X | Rest], NewRest, _).

bubble_pass([X, Y | Rest], [X | NewRest], Swapped) :-
    X =< Y,
    bubble_pass([Y | Rest], NewRest, Swapped).

bubble_pass([X], [X], false).

forth_sort(L, L2) :- bubblesort(L, [], L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```
</Final_Answer>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The code is syntactically valid and implements a bubblesort algorithm as required. The test result shows that the algorithm correctly sorts the input list [3,1,2,5,7,12] into [1,2,3,5,7,12] with a probability of 1.0000, indicating logical correctness for this specific case. However, there are potential issues with the implementation that could affect its robustness or performance for other inputs." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No critical errors were identified in the code. The test result confirms the correctness of the implementation for the given input. However, the code could be optimized for clarity and efficiency, and edge cases (e.g., empty lists or lists with duplicate elements) should be tested further." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "47D659C8",
        "Report": "The code correctly implements the bubblesort algorithm, but the `bubble_pass/3` predicate could be simplified for better readability. The use of `_` in the recursive call of `bubble_pass` might obscure the logic. Additionally, the `append/3` predicate is correctly defined but redundant in this context, as the `bubblesort/3` predicate already handles the accumulation of the sorted list."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Simplify the `bubble_pass/3` predicate to improve readability. 2. Remove the redundant `append/3` predicate if it is not used elsewhere. 3. Test the code with additional edge cases (e.g., empty lists, lists with duplicates) to ensure robustness. 4. Consider adding comments to clarify the logic of the `bubblesort/3` and `bubble_pass/3` predicates." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
