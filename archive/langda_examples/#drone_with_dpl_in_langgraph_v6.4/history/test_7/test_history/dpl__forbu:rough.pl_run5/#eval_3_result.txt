  "Report": "The code block implements the bubblesort algorithm correctly in terms of logic, but it relies on the `append/3` predicate, which is not defined or imported. This causes the ProbLog engine to raise an `UnknownClause` error. The `append/3` predicate is essential for concatenating lists during the sorting process. The code block needs to be regenerated to include the definition or import of `append/3` to resolve the dependency issue.",
