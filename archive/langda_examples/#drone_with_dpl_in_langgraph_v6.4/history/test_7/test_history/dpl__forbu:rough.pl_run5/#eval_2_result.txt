  "Report": "The `bubblesort/3` predicate contains a syntax error in the conditional statement (`->/2`), which is not supported in ProbLog. The `bubble_pass` predicate also lacks a clause for empty lists, potentially causing runtime errors. The logic for swapping elements is correct, but the syntax needs adaptation for ProbLog. Recommendations: 1) Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible conditionals (e.g., `if-then-else` or separate clauses). 2) Add explicit handling for empty lists in `bubble_pass`. 3) Ensure compatibility with ProbLog syntax.",

  "Report": "The `forth_sort/2` predicate is a simple wrapper for `bubblesort/3` but does not handle edge cases explicitly (e.g., empty lists). The query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` is valid, but its execution depends on the corrected `bubblesort/3`. Recommendations: 1) Regenerate after fixing `bubblesort/3`. 2) Explicitly handle edge cases in `forth_sort/2` for robustness.",
