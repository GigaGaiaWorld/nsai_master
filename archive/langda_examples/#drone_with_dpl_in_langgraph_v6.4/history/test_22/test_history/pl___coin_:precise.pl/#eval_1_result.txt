    "Report": "The code block has several issues. First, there's a syntax error with an unexpected character '.' in the code. Second, the logic for counting successful coin flips is incorrect - it's using the counter value CNT as the argument to coin/1, which doesn't match the requirement of flipping different coins. The requirements suggest we should have 4 distinct coins (when counting down from 4), but the current implementation treats each count as a separate coin. The code needs to be restructured to properly model flipping 4 distinct coins with probability 0.8 and counting successes.",
