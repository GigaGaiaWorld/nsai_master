System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).

coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    make_coin(CNT,_),
    (coin(CNT) -> 
        CNT1 is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC1,S,CNT1),
        SC is SC1 + 1
    ; 
        CNT1 is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC,S,CNT1)
    ).

total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: EA5E8D55 </HASH>
<Requirements>With the counter CNT decreasing to 0, each step:  If the CNTth coin coin(CNT) turns up heads, the success count SC increases by 1;  Otherwise, it remains unchanged;  Finally, all steps are accumulated to S. </Requirements></Langda>
.
total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = self.handle_nonground(
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
