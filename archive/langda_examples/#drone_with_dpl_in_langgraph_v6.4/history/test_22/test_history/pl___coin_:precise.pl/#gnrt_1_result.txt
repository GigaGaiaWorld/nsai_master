Based on the analysis report, I'll regenerate the problematic code block. The main issues were incorrect syntax and flawed logic for counting coin flips. Here's the corrected version:

```problog
{"HASH": "EA5E8D55","Code": "PH::make_coin(C,PH).\ncoin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).\n\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n    CNT > 0,\n    make_coin(CNT,_),\n    (coin(CNT) -> \n        CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n        coins_r(SC1,S,CNT1),\n        SC is SC1 + 1\n    ; \n        CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n        coins_r(SC,S,CNT1)\n    ).\n\ntotal(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).\nquery(total(_))."}
```

Key improvements made:
1. Fixed syntax issues
2. Properly structured the recursive counting logic
3. Used conditional (->/;) for clearer success/failure paths
4. Ensured each coin flip is independent by using make_coin/2
5. Maintained the requirement of counting down from 4 distinct coins
6. Kept the probability at 0.8 for each coin flip
7. Properly accumulates successes in the SC variable
