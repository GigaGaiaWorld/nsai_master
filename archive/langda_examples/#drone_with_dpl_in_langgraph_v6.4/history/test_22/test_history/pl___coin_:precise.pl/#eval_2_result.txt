{"HASH": "EA5E8D55","Report": "The code has several issues. First, there's a non-ground probabilistic clause error because 'make_coin(CNT,_)' is using CNT as both an integer counter and a coin identifier, which violates Problog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground. Second, the logic for counting successful coin flips is problematic - it's trying to create new coins dynamically when it should be using the same coin each time. The requirements call for flipping the same coin multiple times, not creating new coins. The base case and recursive case structure is correct, but the probabilistic handling needs complete revision.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
