System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Code>
PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>PH::make_coin(C,PH).\ncoin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n coin(CNT),\n CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n coins_r(SC1,S,CNT1),\n SC is SC1 + 1.\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n \+ coin(CNT),\n CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n coins_r(SC,S,CNT1).\ntotal(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).\nquery(total(_)).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block has several issues. First, there's a syntax error with an unexpected character '.' in the code. Second, the logic for counting successful coin flips is incorrect - it's using the counter value CNT as the argument to coin/1, which doesn't match the requirement of flipping different coins. The requirements suggest we should have 4 distinct coins (when counting down from 4), but the current implementation treats each count as a separate coin. The code needs to be restructured to properly model flipping 4 distinct coins with probability 0.8 and counting successes.</Report>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: EA5E8D55 </HASH>
<Requirements>With the counter CNT decreasing to 0, each step:  If the CNTth coin coin(CNT) turns up heads, the success count SC increases by 1;  Otherwise, it remains unchanged;  Finally, all steps are accumulated to S. </Requirements></Langda>

query(total(_)).

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
