Based on the provided code and test results, here's the analysis for each code block:

```report
{"HASH": "B79F5C58","Report": "The code block implements the requirement correctly by checking if the attempted flap position is legal. However, the test error suggests there might be a syntax issue in how this block is integrated into the larger code (missing period or incorrect line breaks). The logic itself is sound but needs proper integration.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "E185A34B","Report": "This code block correctly implements the overrun exception condition when an illegal position is attempted. Like the previous block, the issue appears to be in integration rather than the logic itself. The negation operator (+\) is correctly used to check for illegal positions.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "779B4ADF","Report": "The goal_reached predicate is correctly implemented to check if the current flap position matches the goal. This is a simple and correct implementation that depends on proper functioning of the flap_position predicate.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

The main issue appears to be in the integration of these code blocks into the larger program, not in the blocks themselves. The error message suggests a parsing error ("Expected binary operator") which typically indicates a syntax issue in how the blocks are connected or terminated in the main file. The dependencies between these blocks are properly maintained (flap_position depends on attempted_flap_position which depends on actuator_strength, etc.), but the syntax error prevents proper evaluation.

Recommendation:
1. Check the integration points between these code blocks in the main file
2. Ensure proper termination (periods) after each predicate
3. Verify correct line breaks and whitespace
4. The code blocks themselves don't need regeneration, but their integration needs fixing
