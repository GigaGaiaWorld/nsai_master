{"HASH": "2D3597DC","Report": "The code block implements parse/2 for addition operation correctly, matching the requirement of handling lists with number followed by plus sign. However, the test result shows a failure (0.0000 probability), indicating either: 1) missing parse rules for other operations (-, *, /), or 2) incorrect operator precedence handling. The block itself is syntactically correct but incomplete for full expression evaluation.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The main issues in the complete code are: 1) Missing parse/2 rules for subtraction, multiplication and division operations (required by requirements), 2) No handling of operator precedence in expressions, 3) The test case fails because the parser can't handle complex expressions without all operation rules. The addition rule (2D3597DC) is correct but insufficient alone.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["2D3597DC"]}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The test failure shows the expression evaluation isn't working. This is caused by missing operation rules rather than the existing addition rule. The almost_equal/2 predicate and basic structure are correct, but need complementary parse rules for all operations and proper expression tree evaluation.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
