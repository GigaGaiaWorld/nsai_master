System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Code_Block>% Game rules for rock-paper-scissors
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).

% Win-lose relationships
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).

% Play a single round
play_round(P1, P2, Result) :-
    (beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win;
    (beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose;
    Result = draw.

% Play multiple rounds
play([], [], []).
play([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [R|Rs]) :-
    play_round(P1, P2, R),
    play(P1s, P2s, Rs).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block has several issues: 1) Missing closing parenthesis in the play_round predicate (syntax error causing the parser error shown in results). 2) The play_round logic could be simplified using separate clauses instead of nested conditionals. 3) While it implements the basic game rules correctly, the syntax error prevents it from running.</Report>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
