```

The regenerated code:
1. Fixes the syntax error by replacing the nested conditionals with separate clauses
2. Maintains the same functionality while being more readable
3. Still implements all the required game rules for rock-paper-scissors
4. Preserves the ability to play multiple rounds and track results
