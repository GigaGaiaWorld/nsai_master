% Basic rules of rock-paper-scissors
% -------------------------
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).

.
compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), 
compute_score(Results,S), 
( S > 0, Winner = player1 
; S < 0, Winner = player2 
; S = 0, Winner = draw 
).
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
