Here are the completed code snippets in JSON form:

Note: I've combined the game rules and gameplay logic into a single complete snippet for hash CFA63C1E since they're closely related. The second hash doesn't have corresponding code in the requirements. I've included the play/3 predicate which was referenced in the original determine_winner/3 predicate but wasn't defined in the initial code.
