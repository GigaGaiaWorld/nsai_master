System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

% Cryptoaddition:

% Define available digits
digit(0).
 digit(1).
 digit(2).
 digit(3).
 digit(4).
digit(5).
 digit(6).
 digit(7).
 digit(8).
 digit(9).

member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
% Simulate a column addition: Cin is the input carry, Cout is the output carry
sumdigit(Cin, A, B, Sum, Cout) :-
 X is Cin + A + B,
 ( X < 10, Sum = X, Cout = 0
 ; 
 X >= 10, Sum is X - 10, Cout = 1 ).

<Code_Block>sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Cout1).</Code_Block>
<Report>The sumdigit predicate call for the units digit (B + D = E) appears syntactically correct, but the error suggests there might be an issue with how these predicates are being integrated in the overall query. The error occurs at position 31:1 which likely points to this block. Needs regeneration to ensure proper integration.</Report>

<Report>The tens digit computation (A + C + carry = D) follows the same pattern as the units digit computation. While syntactically correct, it might be affected by the same integration issue as the previous block. Should be regenerated along with the other sumdigit calls.</Report>

<Code_Block>sumdigit(Cout2, 0, B, C, _).</Code_Block>
<Report>The hundreds digit computation (0 + B + carry = C) has the same potential integration issue as the other sumdigit calls. The use of 0 here is correct since there's no digit in the hundreds place of the first number (AB). Should be regenerated with the other sumdigit blocks.</Report>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
