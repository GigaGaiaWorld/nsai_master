Based on the analysis reports, I'll regenerate the code blocks that need to be updated, ensuring proper integration with the main query predicate. Here are the regenerated code blocks in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "A8860BE4","Code": "sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Cout1),"}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "702CD838","Code": "sumdigit(Cout1, A, C, D, Cout2),"}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "57FD427B","Code": "sumdigit(Cout2, 0, B, C, _),"}
```

The main changes made are:
1. Added commas at the end of each sumdigit call to properly chain them together in the query_sum predicate
2. Kept the same logical structure but ensured proper predicate chaining
3. Maintained all the original functionality while fixing the integration issues mentioned in the reports

These regenerated blocks should now work correctly when integrated into the full cryptoaddition program.
