{"HASH": "A37F4273","Report": "The query_pop/1 predicate is correctly implemented according to the requirements. It finds pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% of each other) using integer arithmetic to avoid division. The test results show correct matches (e.g., china and france with densities 244 and 246 respectively, which satisfy 20*244 < 21*246 and 20*246 < 21*244). No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

The calculation matches the test results (e.g., france's density is correctly calculated as (525*100)//213 = 246). No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
