{"HASH": "5AD7264B","Report": "The code block has several issues. First, there's a syntax error in the determine_winner predicate where the arrow '->' is not properly formatted in Prolog/DeepProbLog syntax. Second, the predicate is not properly closed with a period. Third, the implementation doesn't fully match the requirements as it doesn't properly handle the case where Score is exactly 0 (draw). The error message indicates the system can't find clauses for '/2', suggesting a parsing/syntax issue. The logic for determining the winner based on score is correct in principle but needs proper syntax formatting.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
