System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Code>
% -------------------------
% Basic rules of rock-paper-scissors
% -------------------------
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).
% -------------------------
% Calculate the result of the game
% -------------------------
% Same gestures are considered a draw
result(X, X, draw) :-
 move(X).
 
% If X beats Y, then X wins
result(X, Y, win) :-
beats(X, Y).
% If Y beats X, then X loses
result(X, Y, lose) :-
beats(Y, X).
 
% End of recursion: empty list corresponds to empty result
play([], [], []).
% Recursive advancement: take out each round of gestures, calculate the results, and continue
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
% The correct call is result(P1,P2,R), not semicolon
result(P1, P2, R),
% (Optional) Update the score according to R
play(P1T, P2T, Rs).
 
compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :-

<Code_Block>determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1;
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2;
     Winner = draw).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block has a syntax error - there's an unexpected newline before the predicate definition. The logic itself is correct for determining the winner based on scores, but the formatting error causes the entire program to fail. This needs to be regenerated with proper syntax.</Report>

<Requirements>Main predicate: Given two player action lists P1Moves and P2Moves, calculate the winner Winner.  Firstly, call the play/3 rule to compare the two players' actions.  Then, generate a Results list containing whether each round is win, lose, or draw with the help of compute_score/2 </Requirements></Langda>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
