  "Report": "The code has several issues that need to be addressed. First, there's a syntax error in the conditional operator (->/2) which is causing the 'UnknownClause' error. The bubble/3 predicate has logical issues - the third clause 'bubble([X], [], 0)' incorrectly returns an empty list instead of preserving the single element. The base case handling in bubblesort/3 and bubble/3 needs revision. The implementation doesn't fully match standard bubble sort behavior where we should track whether any swaps occurred in a full pass through the list. The requirements call for an interpretable bubblesort, but the current implementation doesn't clearly show the sorting steps.",
