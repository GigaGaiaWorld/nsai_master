System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The code has several issues that need to be addressed. First, there's a syntax error in the conditional operator (->/2) which is causing the 'UnknownClause' error. The bubble/3 predicate has logical issues - the third clause 'bubble([X], [], 0)' incorrectly returns an empty list instead of preserving the single element. The base case handling in bubblesort/3 and bubble/3 needs revision. The implementation doesn't fully match standard bubble sort behavior where we should track whether any swaps occurred in a full pass through the list. The requirements call for an interpretable bubblesort, but the current implementation doesn't clearly show the sorting steps.</Report>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
