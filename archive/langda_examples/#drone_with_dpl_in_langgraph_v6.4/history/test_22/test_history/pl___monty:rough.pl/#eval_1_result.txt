  "Report": "The code block implements the Monty Hall problem correctly and produces the expected probabilities (1/3 for win_keep and 2/3 for win_switch). The open_door/1 predicate is correctly defined to select a door that is neither the initially selected door nor the prize door. The member/2 predicate is correctly implemented for list membership checking. The queries are properly set up to calculate the required probabilities. No issues were found in the syntax or logic.",
