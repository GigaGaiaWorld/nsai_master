<Report>The code block implements a cryptarithmetic puzzle solver for AB + BCD = CDE. Analysis reveals several issues: 1) The test results show multiple solutions (10 different combinations) when the puzzle should have a unique solution, indicating the constraints are not strict enough. 2) The sumdigit predicate correctly handles carry operations but the main query_sum predicate needs additional constraints to ensure uniqueness. 3) The all_different predicate works correctly but isn't sufficient alone to guarantee a unique solution. 4) The requirements specify finding a unique answer, which isn't achieved currently.</Report>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
