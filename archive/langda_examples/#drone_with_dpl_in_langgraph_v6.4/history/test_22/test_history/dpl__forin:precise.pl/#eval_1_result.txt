  "Report": "The code block implements insertion sort correctly in Prolog/ProbLog. It meets both requirements: 1) it recursively sorts the tail list, and 2) properly inserts the head element into the sorted list. The test result shows it correctly sorts [3,1,2,5,7,12] to [1,2,3,5,7,12] with probability 1.0000, indicating successful implementation. The code has proper base cases and recursive cases for both insertion_sort and insert_element predicates. No syntax or logical errors were found.",
