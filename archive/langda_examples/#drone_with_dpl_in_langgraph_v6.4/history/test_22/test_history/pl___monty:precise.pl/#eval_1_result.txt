Based on the analysis of the code and test results, here are the reports for each code block:

```report
{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","Report": "The code block has syntax issues as indicated by the parser error 'Expected binary operator'. The rule definition is incomplete and incorrectly formatted. The logic for handling two empty doors appears correct conceptually but needs proper syntax implementation. The requirements are properly addressed in the logic but not in the execution.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "F0FDE8AB","Report": "This code block for handling the single empty door case appears syntactically incomplete in the provided code (ends with a dot). However, the logic described in requirements is correct - it should match the only empty door and open it with certainty. The implementation needs to be completed with proper syntax.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["A4F0EAE2"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "GENERAL_CODE","Report": "The general code structure has several issues: 1) The prize distribution is correctly defined. 2) The select_door(1) fact is hardcoded which may limit flexibility. 3) The member/2 predicate is correctly defined. 4) The win_keep and win_switch rules are correctly implemented. 5) The queries are properly defined. The main issues are in the open_door rules.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["A4F0EAE2", "F0FDE8AB"]}
```

The main problems are:
1. Syntax errors in the probabilistic open_door rule (A4F0EAE2)
2. Incomplete implementation of the deterministic open_door rule (F0FDE8AB)
3. The general structure is sound but depends on the correct implementation of these rules

The dependencies indicate that fixing the open_door rules will resolve most issues, as the rest of the code is correctly implemented. The parser error specifically points to line 8 character 7, which corresponds to the first open_door rule definition.
