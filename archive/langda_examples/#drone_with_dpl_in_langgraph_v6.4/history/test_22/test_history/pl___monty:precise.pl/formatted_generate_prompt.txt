System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>
% Based on Monty Hall problem on https://github.com/friguzzi/cplint
1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).
select_door(1).
member(X,[X|T]).
member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: A4F0EAE2 </HASH>
<Requirements>If there are two doors that are not selected and neither of them hides a prize  Let the two doors be numbered A and B (and A < B ensures that each pair is counted only once).  When faced with two empty doors, the host randomly and fairly chooses one to open. </Requirements></Langda>
.
open_door(A) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: F0FDE8AB </HASH>
<Requirements>If only one door is not selected and does not contain a prize.   This means that the other unselected door is exactly the one that contains the prize.  Then this rule will match the only empty door A and open it with certainty (probability 1). </Requirements></Langda>
.
win_keep :-
 select_door(A),
 prize(A).
win_switch :-
 member(A, [1,2,3]),
 \+ select_door(A),
 prize(A),
 \+ open_door(A).
query(prize(_)).
query(select_door(_)).
query(win_keep).
query(win_switch).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
