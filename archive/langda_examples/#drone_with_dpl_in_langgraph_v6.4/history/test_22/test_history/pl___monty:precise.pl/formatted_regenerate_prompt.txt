System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).
select_door(1).
member(X,[X|T]).
member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A, [1,2,3]),\n    member(B, [1,2,3]),\n    A < B,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ select_door(B).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block has syntax issues as indicated by the parser error 'Expected binary operator'. The rule definition is incomplete and incorrectly formatted. The logic for handling two empty doors appears correct conceptually but needs proper syntax implementation. The requirements are properly addressed in the logic but not in the execution.</Report>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: A4F0EAE2 </HASH>
<Requirements>If there are two doors that are not selected and neither of them hides a prize  Let the two doors be numbered A and B (and A < B ensures that each pair is counted only once).  When faced with two empty doors, the host randomly and fairly chooses one to open. </Requirements></Langda>
.
open_door(A) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>open_door(A) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A, [1,2,3]),\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ (member(Other, [1,2,3]), Other \= A, Other \= Selected, \+ prize(Other)).</Code_Block>
<Report>This code block for handling the single empty door case appears syntactically incomplete in the provided code (ends with a dot). However, the logic described in requirements is correct - it should match the only empty door and open it with certainty. The implementation needs to be completed with proper syntax.</Report>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: F0FDE8AB </HASH>
<Requirements>If only one door is not selected and does not contain a prize.   This means that the other unselected door is exactly the one that contains the prize.  Then this rule will match the only empty door A and open it with certainty (probability 1). </Requirements></Langda>
.
win_keep :-
 select_door(A),
 prize(A).
win_switch :-
 member(A, [1,2,3]),
 \+ select_door(A),
 prize(A),
 \+ open_door(A).
query(prize(_)).
query(select_door(_)).
query(win_keep).
query(win_switch).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
