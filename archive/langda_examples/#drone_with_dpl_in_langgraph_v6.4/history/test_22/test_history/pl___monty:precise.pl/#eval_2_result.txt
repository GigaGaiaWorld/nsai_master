Based on the analysis of the code and test results, here are the reports for each code block:

```report
{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","Report": "The code block implements the Monty Hall problem's rule for when there are two empty doors. The syntax appears correct and it properly handles the case where both A and B are not selected and don't contain prizes. The logic ensures each pair is only counted once (A < B). However, the test failure suggests there might be an integration issue with how this block connects to the rest of the program.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "F0FDE8AB","Report": "This code block handles the case when there's only one empty door to open. While the logic appears correct (it finds the only door that's not selected and doesn't contain a prize), the test failure indicates a parsing error at line 8:7, which suggests there might be a syntax issue in how this rule is integrated with the rest of the program. The error 'Expected binary operator' typically occurs when Prolog syntax rules aren't properly followed.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "GLOBAL","Report": "The overall code has several issues: 1) The parsing error suggests improper syntax integration between rules, 2) The open_door/1 predicate has two separate implementations that need proper integration, 3) The test failure points to line 8:7 which is likely between these two implementations. The main issue appears to be in how the different open_door rules are combined. The individual implementations are mostly correct but need proper syntactic integration.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["A4F0EAE2", "F0FDE8AB"]}
```

The primary issue appears to be in how the different open_door rules are combined syntactically, not necessarily in their individual implementations. The global structure needs regeneration to properly integrate these components while the individual implementations can largely remain as they are.
