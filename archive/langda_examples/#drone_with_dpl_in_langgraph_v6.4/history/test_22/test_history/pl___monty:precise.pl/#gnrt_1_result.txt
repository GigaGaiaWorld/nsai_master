Here are the regenerated code blocks in the requested format:

```

The regenerated code addresses the syntax issues while maintaining the original logic requirements:
1. For the two-empty-doors case, it properly implements the random selection between two valid doors (A and B) that aren't selected and don't contain prizes
2. For the single-empty-door case, it correctly identifies the only door that isn't selected and doesn't contain a prize
3. Both rules now have proper syntax and complete implementations
