<Report>The code block implements a cryptarithmetic puzzle solver for AB + BCD = CDE with the following analysis:

1. Positive Aspects:
- Correctly defines digits (0-9) and leftdigit constraints
- Properly implements all_different/1 predicate
- Correctly implements sumdigit/5 with carry handling
- Follows the mathematical structure of the puzzle

2. Issues Found:
- The test results show multiple solutions (10 different answers) when the puzzle should have a unique solution
- The constraints may not be strict enough to enforce uniqueness
- The carry handling in the final sumdigit call (with 0+B=C) might need review

3. Recommendations:
- Add additional constraints to ensure uniqueness
- Verify the carry propagation logic in the final column
- Consider adding constraints that reflect the full equation (AB + BCD = CDE)

4. Dependencies:
- No dependencies on other code blocks</Report>

<Requirements>please construct the alphabet math puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE with following laws:  1. Firstly define all the digits, the first digit of a multi-digit number cannot be 0 (with the help of digit/1 and leftdigit/1),  2. Different letters refer to different numbers with the help of all_different/1,  3. calculate with the help of sumdigit/5, don't forget to carry. </Requirements></Langda>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
