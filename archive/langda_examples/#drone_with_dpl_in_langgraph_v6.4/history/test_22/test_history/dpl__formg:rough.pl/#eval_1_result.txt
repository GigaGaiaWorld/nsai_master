  "Report": "The code implements a correct merge sort algorithm in Prolog. It correctly handles the base cases (empty list and single-element list), properly splits the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the results. The test result shows it successfully sorts [3,1,2,5,7,12] into [1,2,3,5,7,12] with probability 1.0000, indicating correct functionality. The append/3 predicate is defined but unused in the main merge_sort implementation. While not strictly necessary for the merge sort, it doesn't affect functionality. The code meets the requirement of being an interpretable merge_sort algorithm.",
