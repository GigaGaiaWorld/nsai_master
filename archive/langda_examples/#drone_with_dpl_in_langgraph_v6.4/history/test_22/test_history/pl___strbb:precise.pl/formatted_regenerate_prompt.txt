System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1,
 palindrome(AA,BB).

<Report>The code block has several issues that need to be addressed. First, the predicate 'bb(N)' is incomplete in the first part of the code (before <Langda> tag), missing its implementation. Second, the implementation in the <Langda> section correctly follows the requirements for 'bb(N)', but there's a syntax error with the dangling 'bb(N) :- ' in the first part. The logic for palindrome generation and checking is correct, and the test result shows reasonable probability (0.6484) for bb(5), indicating the adjacent 'b' check works. The main issues are the incomplete predicate and syntax error in the first part.</Report>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: FA856BCD </HASH>
<Requirements>The function of the predicate bb(N) is: for a string of length N, it checks whether there is a pair of adjacent positions in which the character b is generated.  First calculate the maximum starting position Max = N-1;  Enumerate each position I between 1 and Max;  For each I, it requires that b is generated at position I (pick(I,b)), and b is also generated at the next position I+1 (pick(I+1,b));  If any such pair of adjacent positions is found, then bb(N) is true. </Requirements></Langda>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
