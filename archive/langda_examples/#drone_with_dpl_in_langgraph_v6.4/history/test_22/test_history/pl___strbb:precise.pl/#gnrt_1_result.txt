Based on the analysis, I'll regenerate the code blocks in the required JSON format. The main issues were the incomplete predicate and syntax error in the first part, while the logic itself was correct.

```problog
{"HASH": "FA856BCD", "Code": "0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
    palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
    A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
    pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
    A < B,
    pick(A,X),
    pick(B,X),
    AA is A+1,
    BB is B-1,
    palindrome(AA,BB).

% Check for adjacent b's in a string of length N
bb(N) :-
    Max is N-1,
    between(1,Max,I),
    pick(I,b),
    pick(I+1,b).

len(5).
evidence(palindrome(X)) :- len(X).
query(bb(X)) :- len(X)."}
