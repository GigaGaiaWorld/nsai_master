System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
number([],Result,Result).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>number([Img|Imgs], Acc, Result) :- digit(Img, Nr), NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr, number(Imgs, NewAcc, Result).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6579E7BA </HASH>
<Requirements> complete the number/3, it's function includes: 1.Convert the head image to the corresponding number Nr 2.Add the current number Nr to the "low bit" of the accumulated value Acc (the high bit is on the right) 3.Continue to recursively process the remaining images </Requirements></Langda>
.
number(X,Y) :- number(X,0,Y).
multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X, XVal), number(Y, YVal), Z is XVal + YVal.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 4A9D0B2A </HASH>
<Requirements>Parse the image list from left to right into numbers. For example: number([img_3,img_4], 0, R) will eventually get R = 34. </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Resultï¼š
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],391) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
