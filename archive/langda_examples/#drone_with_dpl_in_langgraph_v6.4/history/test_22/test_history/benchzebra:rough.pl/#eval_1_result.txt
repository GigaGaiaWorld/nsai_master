{"HASH": "AA4D04D8","Report": "The my_member/2 predicate is correctly implemented to check if an element X is a member of a list. It follows the standard Prolog member predicate implementation with two clauses: one for the base case where X is the head of the list, and one for the recursive case where X is in the tail. This implementation is syntactically and logically correct, integrates well with other code blocks, and the test results show it works as expected.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "3C24DB80","Report": "The next_to/3 predicate is correctly implemented to check if two elements X and Y are next to each other in a list, in either order. It uses the right_of/3 predicate in both directions (X right of Y and Y right of X) to achieve this. The implementation is correct and the test results confirm it works as intended.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["8660991C"]}
