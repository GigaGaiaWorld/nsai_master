  "Report": "The code implements a correct insertion sort algorithm in Prolog. The implementation meets the requirements of being interpretable and produces the correct sorted output as shown in the test result. The base cases and recursive cases are properly defined, and the sorting logic is sound. The test query demonstrates that the code works as expected, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000. No issues were found in the syntax or logic of the implementation.",
