Based on the analysis report, I'll regenerate the code block for the robot movement rules to ensure proper probability distribution and integration with the action sequence. Here's the corrected version:

```problog
{"HASH": "8EB675E6","Code": "at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_succeeds(T), do(goto(Pos),T).\nat(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_fails(T), at(robot,Pos,T).\nat(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-\n    \\+ goto_action(T),\n    at(robot,Pos,T)."}
```

The changes include:
1. Maintaining the original two predicates for success/failure cases of goto action
2. Adding a third predicate to handle cases where no goto action is performed
3. Ensuring the probabilities will properly propagate through the action sequence (loc0 → loc1 → loc2)
4. The 0.9 success probability should now correctly show in the query results

This should now properly integrate with the action sequence defined at the bottom (do(goto(loc1),0), etc.) and produce the expected probability distribution for robot positions.
