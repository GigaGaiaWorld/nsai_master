{"HASH": "8EB675E6","Report": "The code block defines movement rules for the robot. While syntactically correct, the test results show unexpected probabilities for robot positions. The goto_succeeds probability (0.9) should result in higher probability for loc2 (0.9) than shown (0.9 for loc2, 0.09 for loc1, 0.01 for loc0). This suggests potential integration issues with other movement rules or actions.
