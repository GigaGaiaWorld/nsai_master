System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The code block defines movement rules for the robot. While syntactically correct, the test results show unexpected probabilities for robot positions. The goto_succeeds probability (0.9) should result in higher probability for loc2 (0.9) than shown (0.9 for loc2, 0.09 for loc1, 0.01 for loc0). This suggests potential integration issues with other movement rules or actions. Needs regeneration to ensure proper integration with the action sequence defined at the bottom (do(goto(loc1),0, etc.).</Report>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
