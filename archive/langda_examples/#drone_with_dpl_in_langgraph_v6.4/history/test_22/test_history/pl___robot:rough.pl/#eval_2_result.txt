  "Report": "The code block implements the movement of the robot and handles both success and failure cases of the goto action. However, there are several issues: 1) The predicate 'goto_action(T)' is defined but not properly integrated with the movement logic. 2) The failure case (goto_fails) doesn't maintain the robot's position correctly. 3) The requirements specify defining two at/3 predicates for success/failure cases, but the implementation mixes these with position maintenance logic. The test results show correct probabilities for robot positions but reveal inconsistencies in key positioning (e.g., key at loc2 has higher probability than expected).",
