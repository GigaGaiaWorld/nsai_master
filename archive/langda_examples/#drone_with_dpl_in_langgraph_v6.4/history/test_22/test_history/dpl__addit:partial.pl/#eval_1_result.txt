Here's the evaluation report for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "1E127226","Report": "The code block correctly implements digit(img_4,4) as required. It follows the same pattern as other digit facts and integrates well with the addition predicate. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "AC3F07DC","Report": "The code block correctly implements digit(img_5,5) as required. It matches the pattern of other digit facts and works correctly in the addition query. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "B75FE8E8","Report": "The code block correctly implements digit(img_6,6) as required. The test result shows it works correctly in the addition operation (5+6=11). No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "FF9B3015","Report": "The code block correctly implements digit(img_8,8) as required. It follows the established pattern and would work correctly in addition operations. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "F7977C59","Report": "The code block correctly implements digit(img_9,9) as required. It maintains consistency with other digit facts and would function properly in arithmetic operations. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "6E46AD63","Report": "The addition predicate logic is correctly implemented. It successfully retrieves digit values and performs addition, as evidenced by the test result (5+6=11). The implementation meets all requirements.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

Overall observations:
1. All code blocks are syntactically correct and logically sound
2. The test result confirms the addition predicate works correctly
3. All digit facts follow a consistent pattern
4. No dependencies need regeneration as all blocks are correct
5. The implementation fully meets all stated requirements

The code appears to be working as intended, with no blocks needing regeneration. The test case successfully demonstrates correct functionality of the addition operation using the digit facts.
