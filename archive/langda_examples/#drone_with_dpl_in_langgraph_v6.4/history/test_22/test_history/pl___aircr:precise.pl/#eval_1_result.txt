  "Report": "The code block implements the attempted_flap_position predicate which calculates the new flap position based on actuator strength and wind effect. Analysis reveals several issues: 1) The test results show all queries returning 0.0 probability, indicating the flap never reaches the goal position (4) and no overrun exceptions occur, which is unexpected given the model parameters. 2) The code correctly implements the requirements for calculating the new position (direction, actuator effect, wind effect), but the failure suggests integration issues with other parts. 3) The wind effect calculations might be too strong, preventing the flap from reaching the goal. 4) The actuator selection probability (50/50) might need adjustment.",
