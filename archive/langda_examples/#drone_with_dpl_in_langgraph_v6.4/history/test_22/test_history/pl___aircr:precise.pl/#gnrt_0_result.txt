Here's the completed code in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "62719B9D","Code": "% if the previous position was not the goal, attempt a new position\n% the position depends on the chosen actuator and the current wind\nattempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,Old),\n \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n use_actuator(Time,A),\n actuator_strength(A,AS),\n goal(GP),\n Direction is sign(GP - Old),\n AE is Direction * AS,\n wind_effect(Time,WE),\n Pos is Old + AE + WE."}
```

The code implements all the requirements from the <Langda> block:
1. Checks if goal was already reached (\+ goal_reached(Prev))
2. Gets the current actuator and its strength (use_actuator/2 and actuator_strength/2)
3. Calculates the actuator effect (AE) based on direction to goal
4. Adds wind effect (WE) to compute the new position (Pos)
5. Uses sign/1 to determine direction (1 for positive, -1 for negative difference)
