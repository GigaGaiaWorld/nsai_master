System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Requirements>  1. Check if the goal has been reached:  If Old already satisfies goal(Old), no new trial position is calculated.    2.Determine the current actuator and its strength:  Select actuator A (use_actuator) according to time Time, and get its thrust AS from actuator_strength(A).    3. Calculate the direction and contribution of the actuator  Take the global target position GP (goal(GP)), and compare the difference direction between GP and Old:  - If the target is in front of the current direction, AE = +AS; if in the opposite direction, AE = −AS;  - Specific calculation: AE = sign(GP − Old) × AS.    4. Superimpose wind interference:  Take the additional effect WE of the wind force on the position at that moment from wind_effect(Time).    Combine the trial position of this step:  Add the three parts and get the current attempt flapping position Pos. </Requirements></Langda>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
