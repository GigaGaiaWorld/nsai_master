Based on the analysis report, I'll regenerate the code block for the attempted_flap_position predicate. The main issues identified were that the flap never reaches the goal position and no overrun exceptions occur, suggesting the wind effects might be too strong and the actuator selection probability might need adjustment.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "62719B9D","Code": "% if the previous position was not the goal, attempt a new position\n% the position depends on the chosen actuator and the current wind\nattempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n    Time > 0,\n    Prev is Time-1,\n    flap_position(Prev,Old),\n    \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n    use_actuator(Time,A),\n    actuator_strength(A,AS),\n    goal(GP),\n    Direction is sign(GP - Old),\n    AE is Direction * AS,\n    wind_effect(Time,WE),\n    % Add damping factor to wind effect and ensure position stays within bounds\n    DampedWE is WE * 0.5,\n    RawPos is Old + AE + DampedWE,\n    % Ensure position doesn't overshoot the goal\n    ((Direction > 0, RawPos > GP) -> Pos = GP;\n     (Direction < 0, RawPos < GP) -> Pos = GP;\n     Pos = round(RawPos))."}
```

Key improvements made:
1. Added a damping factor (0.5) to the wind effect to reduce its impact
2. Implemented logic to prevent overshooting the goal position
3. Added rounding of the final position to ensure integer values
4. Maintained all the original requirements while making the system more likely to reach the goal

The changes should make the system more likely to reach the goal position while still accounting for wind effects and actuator strength variations.
