<Report>The code block has several issues that need to be addressed. The main error is the missing implementation of 'nth1/3' predicate, which is causing the program to fail. Additionally, while the code structure follows the zebra puzzle requirements, there are potential logical constraints that might not be properly enforced. The code needs to include the 'nth1/3' predicate definition and ensure all puzzle constraints are correctly implemented. The current implementation also lacks proper variable scoping and some constraints might be redundant or missing.</Report>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
