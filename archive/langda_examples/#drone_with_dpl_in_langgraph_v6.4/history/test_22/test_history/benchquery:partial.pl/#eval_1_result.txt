Overall analysis:
1. All population data blocks are correctly implemented and match their requirements
2. All blocks integrate properly with the area data and density calculations
3. Test results show correct density calculations for countries mentioned in results
4. No blocks need regeneration as all are functioning as intended
5. There are no dependencies between blocks that need regeneration
