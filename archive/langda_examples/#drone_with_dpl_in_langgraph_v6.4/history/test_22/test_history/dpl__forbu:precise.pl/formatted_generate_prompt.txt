System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
 swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
 swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):-
 hole(H1,H2,X1,X2),
 bubble([X2|T],T1,X).
bubblesort([],L,L).
bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 2971FD2F </HASH>
<Requirements>Recursively call bubblesort on L2 and put the current maximum value X into the sorted part [X|L3]. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 5CBF7C6A </HASH>
<Requirements>The logical predicate that determines whether to exchange </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
