System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
 swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
 swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):-
 hole(H1,H2,X1,X2),
 bubble([X2|T],T1,X).
bubblesort([],L,L).
bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>bubblesort([X|L1],L3,Sorted) :- bubble([X|L1],L2,X), bubblesort(L2,[X|L3],Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 2971FD2F </HASH>
<Requirements>Recursively call bubblesort on L2 and put the current maximum value X into the sorted part [X|L3]. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>swap(X,Y,swap) :- X > Y.
swap(X,Y,no_swap) :- X =< Y.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 5CBF7C6A </HASH>
<Requirements>The logical predicate that determines whether to exchange </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 Error evaluating Problog model:
    rf = self.fold(
         ^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1101, in fold
    raise ParseError(
problog.parser.ParseError: Operator priority clash at 12:30.</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
