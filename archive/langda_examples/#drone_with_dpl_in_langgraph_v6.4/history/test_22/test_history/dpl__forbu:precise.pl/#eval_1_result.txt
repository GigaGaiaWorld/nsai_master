{"HASH": "2971FD2F","Report": "The code block implements the bubblesort predicate correctly by recursively calling bubblesort on L2 and accumulating the sorted elements in [X|L3]. The logic matches the requirement of putting the current maximum value X into the sorted part. However, there appears to be a syntax error in the overall code (Operator priority clash) that might be related to how this block integrates with the rest of the code. The block itself is logically correct but needs to be checked for proper integration.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "5CBF7C6A","Report": "The swap predicate is correctly implemented with two clauses that handle both swapping and non-swapping cases based on the comparison of X and Y. This meets the requirement of determining whether to exchange elements. The logic is sound and doesn't appear to be the source of the syntax error in the test results.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "MAIN_CODE","Report": "The main issue appears to be in the overall code structure and integration, not in the individual Langda blocks. There's a syntax error (Operator priority clash) that suggests problems with operator precedence or missing punctuation in the main body of the code. The bubblesort/3 predicate definition is incomplete before the Langda block insertion. The forth_sort/2 predicate seems correct but depends on proper implementation of bubblesort.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["2971FD2F", "5CBF7C6A"]}
