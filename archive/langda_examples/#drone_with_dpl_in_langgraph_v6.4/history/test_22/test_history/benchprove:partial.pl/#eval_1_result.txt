Here are the evaluations for each code block in the provided code:

```report
{"HASH": "230CB29D","Report": "The code block correctly implements the implies predicate as 'prove(implies(P,Q)) :- \+ prove(P); prove(Q).' which matches the requirement that P is unprovable or Q is provable. The test results show it works correctly with the example query. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "B2BAF677","Report": "The code block correctly implements the opposite predicate as 'prove(opposite(P)) :- \+ prove(P).' which matches the requirement that P is unprovable. The test results confirm it works correctly. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "62B0CEA4","Report": "The code block correctly implements the extend predicate as 'prove(extend(List,Elem,Extended)) :- Extended = [Elem|List].' which matches the requirement to add Elem to the head of List. The test results confirm it works correctly. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0F69CE0F","Report": "The code block correctly implements the expand predicate for doubling as 'expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.' which matches the requirement that Y is X*2. The test results confirm it works correctly with the example query. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The main prove/1 predicate definitions (for true, compound goals, and basic clause handling) are correct and work well with all the extended predicates. The test results show all queries return the expected results (1.0000 probability). The entire implementation is logically sound and well-integrated.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

All code blocks:
1. Correctly implement their requirements
2. Are syntactically and logically correct
3. Integrate well with each other
4. Pass all test cases shown in the results
5. Have no dependencies that need regeneration

No code blocks need to be regenerated in this implementation.
