  "Report": "The code block defines a parse/2 predicate for handling addition operations, but it fails to meet all requirements. Issues identified: 1) Only addition is handled, missing subtraction, multiplication and division cases as required. 2) The test result shows 0.0000 probability, indicating the parsing failed completely. 3) The implementation doesn't properly chain operations due to missing cases. 4) The almost_equal/2 predicate is used correctly but the overall parsing logic is incomplete.",
