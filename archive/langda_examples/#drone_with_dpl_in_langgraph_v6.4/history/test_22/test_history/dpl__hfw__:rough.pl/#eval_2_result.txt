  "Report": "The code block implements the parse/2 predicate correctly according to the requirements. It handles all four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with separate predicates and uses almost_equal/2 for floating-point comparison. The test result shows correct evaluation of the expression (2/3 + 3 - 2*7 = 11.666...), confirming the implementation works as intended. The code is syntactically correct, logically sound, and properly integrated with the rest of the program.",
