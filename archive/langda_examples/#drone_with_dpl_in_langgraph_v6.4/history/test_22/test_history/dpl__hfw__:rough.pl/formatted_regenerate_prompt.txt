System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The code block defines a parse/2 predicate for handling addition operations, but it fails to meet all requirements. Issues identified: 1) Only addition is handled, missing subtraction, multiplication and division cases as required. 2) The test result shows 0.0000 probability, indicating the parsing failed completely. 3) The implementation doesn't properly chain operations due to missing cases. 4) The almost_equal/2 predicate is used correctly but the overall parsing logic is incomplete.</Report>

<Requirements>Define parse/2, it get a number followed with one of four operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) in the form of a list, each rule is written under a separate parse/2 predicate.(consider almost equal) </Requirements></Langda>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
