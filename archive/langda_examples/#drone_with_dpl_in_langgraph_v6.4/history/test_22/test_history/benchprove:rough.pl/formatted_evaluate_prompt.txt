System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
% member/2 for ProbLog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
% --------- Basic meta-interpreter ---------
% Prove "true" always succeeds
prove(true).
prove(Goal) :-
	% For all other goals, use the clause/2 facts/rules defined in the program
	clause(Goal, Body),
	prove(Body).
% Prove compound goal A,B: prove A first, then prove B
prove((A,B)) :-
	prove(A),
	prove(B).
% --------- Extended logic processing ---------
<Langda>
<Code_Block>% --------- Extended logic processing ---------
% implies/2: A implies B succeeds if B can be proved when A is true
implies(A, B) :- A, B.

% opposite/1: opposite(G) succeeds if G cannot be proved
opposite(G) :- \+ G.

% expand/2: expand Term using defined rules
expand(Term, Result) :- call(Term, Result).

% includes/2: includes(List, Elem) succeeds if Elem is in List
includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).

% extend/2: add Elem to head of List
extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).

% refute/1: refute(G) succeeds if opposite(G) can be proved
refute(G) :- opposite(G).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 2DFC0CFD </HASH>
<Requirements>Extended define multiple prove/1 logic processing predicates, which should contain: 	1.implies/2 	2.opposite/1 	3.expand/2 (use already defined rules) 	4.includes/2 	5.extend/2(add Elem to the head of List) 	6.refute/1 </Requirements></Langda>
.
% --------- Examples ---------- %
% Define some expand rules:
expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.
expand(square(X), Y) :- Y is X*X.
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, carol).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y).
% --------- Queries ---------- %
query(prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))).
query(prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))).
query(prove(expand(double(3),6))).
query(prove(includes([a,b,c],b))).
query(prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 Error evaluating Problog model:
    elif type(t1) != type(t2):
                     ^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/MASTERTHESIS/#Expert_System_Design/examples/LANGDA/#drone_with_dpl_in_langgraph_v6.4/utils/test_tools.py", line 17, in timeout_handler
    raise TimeoutError(f"Function timed out while processing file: {file_basename}")
TimeoutError: Function timed out while processing file: benchprove:rough.pl</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
