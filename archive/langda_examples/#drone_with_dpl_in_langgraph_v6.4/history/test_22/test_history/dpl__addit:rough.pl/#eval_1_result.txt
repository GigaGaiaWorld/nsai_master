{"HASH": "06576BEB","Report": "The code block implements the 'number' predicate correctly to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. The base case handles empty lists, and the recursive case correctly calculates the number by considering digit positions. The test case shows it works correctly when integrated with multi_addition (79 + 312 = 391). No syntax or logical issues found. The implementation fully meets the requirements.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
