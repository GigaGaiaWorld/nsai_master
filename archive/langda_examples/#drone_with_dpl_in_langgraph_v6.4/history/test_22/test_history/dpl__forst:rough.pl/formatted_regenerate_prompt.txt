System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block implements only the push operation correctly, as shown by the test results. Other operations (pop, dup, swap, over, rot) are not implemented but are included in the queries, resulting in 0.0000 probabilities. The sort operation is partially implemented but not tested. The code needs to be expanded to implement all stack operations mentioned in the queries. The requirements mention implementing a series of stack operations, but currently only push is fully implemented.</Report>

stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-
 get_top_n(Stack, 3, Elements, RestStack),
 insertion_sort(Elements, SortedElements),
 append(SortedElements, RestStack, SortedStack).
get_top_n(Stack, N, Elements, Rest) :-
 length(Elements, N),
 append(Elements, Rest, Stack).
query(stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
