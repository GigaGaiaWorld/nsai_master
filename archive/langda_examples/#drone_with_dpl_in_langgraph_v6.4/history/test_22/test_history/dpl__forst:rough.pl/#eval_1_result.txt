{"HASH": "5E40E418","Report": "The code block implements only the push operation correctly, as shown by the test results. Other operations (pop, dup, swap, over, rot) are not implemented but are included in the queries, resulting in 0.0000 probabilities. The sort operation is partially implemented but not tested. The code needs to be expanded to implement all stack operations mentioned in the queries. The requirements mention implementing a series of stack operations, but currently only push is fully implemented.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
