  "Report": "The code implements various stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot, sort) correctly as evidenced by the test results. All operations return the expected results with probability 1.0000. The sort operation specifically handles only the top 3 elements of the stack, which is a design choice that should be documented. The helper predicates (get_top_n and insertion_sort) work as intended. No syntax or logical errors were found. The implementation fully meets the stated requirements for stack operations.",
