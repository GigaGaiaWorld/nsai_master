***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code introduces significant modifications to the original logic, particularly in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate. It adds a damping factor to wind effects and attempts to prevent overshooting the goal, which fundamentally changes the behavior of the system. These changes make the generated code inconsistent with the original code's purpose and logic. The running results show all zeros, indicating the modified logic prevents any movement toward the goal or overrun exceptions, which is not the expected behavior.
