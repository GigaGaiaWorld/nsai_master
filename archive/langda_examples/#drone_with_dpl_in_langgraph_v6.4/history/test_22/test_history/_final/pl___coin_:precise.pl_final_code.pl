problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5. 

***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause, which is not allowed in Problog. The original code correctly uses ground probabilistic facts, while the generated code attempts to use a non-ground make_coin(CNT,_) call. Additionally, the logic for counting successful coin flips has been altered in a way that breaks the original functionality. The generated code fails to compile due to the non-ground clause error, and even if it did compile, the logic would not produce the same results as the original code.
