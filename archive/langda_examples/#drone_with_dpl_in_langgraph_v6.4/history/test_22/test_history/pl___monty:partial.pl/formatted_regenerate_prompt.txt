System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).
select_door(1).
member(X,[X|T]).
member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A, [1,2,3]),\n    member(B, [1,2,3]),\n    A \= B,\n    A \= Selected,\n    B \= Selected,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block has syntax issues with the binary operator. The probabilities should be properly formatted with spaces around '::'. The logic correctly implements the requirement of randomly opening one door when both unselected doors are empty. However, it needs syntax correction.</Report>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: C5B4A895 </HASH>
<Requirements>When both unselected doors are empty (no prize), open one of them randomly. </Requirements></Langda>
.
open_door(A) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>open_door(A) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A, [1,2,3]),\n    A \= Selected,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    member(B, [1,2,3]),\n    B \= Selected,\n    B \= A,\n    prize(B).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block has a logical error in the condition 'B \= A' which should be 'B \== A' (not the same door). Also, the syntax needs proper spacing around operators. The requirement is correctly implemented (host opens empty door when one unselected door has prize), but needs syntax fixes.</Report>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 338175EC </HASH>
<Requirements>When one unselected door has no prize and the other unselected door has a prize, the host will definitely open the door without a prize. </Requirements></Langda>
.
win_keep :-
 

    select_door(Selected),
    prize(Selected).
win_switch :-
 member(A, [1,2,3]),
 \+ select_door(A),
 prize(A),
 \+ open_door(A).
query(prize(_)).
query(select_door(_)).
query(win_keep).
query(win_switch).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
