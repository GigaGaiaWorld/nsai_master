Based on the provided code and test results, here are the evaluations for each code block:

```report
{"HASH": "C5B4A895","Report": "The code block implements the requirement correctly for randomly opening a door when both unselected doors are empty. However, there appears to be a syntax error in the original code where this block is not properly integrated (missing line continuation or period). The logic itself is correct but needs proper integration with the rest of the program.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "338175EC","Report": "This code block correctly implements the requirement for opening the empty door when one unselected door has a prize. However, similar to the first block, there's a syntax integration issue in the main code. The logic is sound but needs to be properly connected to the rest of the program with correct syntax.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The main issue appears to be in the overall code structure and syntax integration, not in the individual code blocks. The error message indicates a parsing error ('Expected binary operator') which suggests problems with how the code blocks are connected together in the main file. The individual blocks are logically correct but need proper syntax integration.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["C5B4A895", "338175EC"]}
```

The key problems are:
1. The code blocks are not properly integrated into the main program (missing proper line continuations or separators)
2. The parser error suggests syntax issues in how the probabilistic facts and rules are connected
3. The individual code blocks themselves are logically correct and meet their requirements
4. The main program structure needs regeneration to properly integrate all components

Recommendation:
1. Keep the two code blocks (HASH C5B4A895 and 338175EC) as they are logically correct
2. Regenerate the main program structure with proper syntax to integrate these blocks
3. Ensure proper separation between probabilistic facts and rules
4. Verify all operators and delimiters are correctly placed
