Here's the evaluation report for each code block:

```report
{"HASH": "C5B4A895","Report": "The code block has syntax issues with the binary operator. The probabilities should be properly formatted with spaces around '::'. The logic correctly implements the requirement of randomly opening one door when both unselected doors are empty. However, it needs syntax correction.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "338175EC","Report": "The code block has a logical error in the condition 'B \= A' which should be 'B \\== A' (not the same door). Also, the syntax needs proper spacing around operators. The requirement is correctly implemented (host opens empty door when one unselected door has prize), but needs syntax fixes.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "B73E5085","Report": "This code block is syntactically correct and properly implements the requirement for the 'keep' winning condition. It doesn't need regeneration as it correctly checks if the initially selected door has the prize.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

Additional notes:
1. The main syntax error in the overall code appears to be missing proper spacing around operators (::, \=) and line breaks between clauses.
2. The win_switch rule at the end is not wrapped in a <Langda> block but also needs proper formatting with spaces around operators.
3. All probability declarations need spaces around the '::' operator.
4. The query statements at the end are correctly formatted but should be separated by newlines from the previous rules.

The error message indicates parsing failed due to binary operator formatting issues, which affects the first two code blocks most significantly. The third block is correctly formatted and doesn't need regeneration.

The dependencies field is empty for all blocks as they can be fixed independently - the issues are primarily syntactic rather than logical dependencies between blocks.
