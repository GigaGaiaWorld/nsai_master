1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).
select_door(1).
member(X,[X|T]).
member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: C5B4A895 </HASH>
<Requirements>When both unselected doors are empty (no prize), open one of them randomly. </Requirements></Langda>
.
open_door(A) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 338175EC </HASH>
<Requirements>When one unselected door has no prize and the other unselected door has a prize, the host will definitely open the door without a prize. </Requirements></Langda>
.
win_keep :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: B73E5085 </HASH>
<Requirements>The winning condition of keeping the original gate strategy: the original gate has a prize </Requirements></Langda>
.
win_switch :-
 member(A, [1,2,3]),
 \+ select_door(A),
 prize(A),
 \+ open_door(A).
query(prize(_)).
query(select_door(_)).
query(win_keep).
query(win_switch).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
