  "Report": "The code block has a syntax error as indicated by the test result 'Expected binary operator at 33:40'. The issue appears to be in the attempted_flap_position predicate definition where there might be a missing operator or incorrect syntax. The requirements are correctly specified (calculating position based on previous position, actuator, target, and wind effect) but the implementation has parsing errors. The code needs to be regenerated with proper syntax and operator usage.",
