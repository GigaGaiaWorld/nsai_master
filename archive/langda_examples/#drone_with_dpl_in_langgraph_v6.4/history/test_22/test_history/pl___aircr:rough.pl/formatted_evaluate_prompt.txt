System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

% Aircraft Flap Controller

% the range of the flap
legal_flap_position(FP) :- between(0,10,FP).
% the strength of the actuators
actuator_strength(a,2).

% random prior on which actuator to use
0.5::use_actuator(T,a); 0.5::use_actuator(T,b).
% wind strength model

0.2::wind_effect(T,-3); 0.3::wind_effect(T,-2); 0.3::wind_effect(T,2); 0.2::wind_effect(T,3) :- wind(strong).
% the flap is moved to an attempted position if that is legal
flap_position(Time,Pos) :-

% did we reach the goal?

% if the previous position was not the goal, attempt a new position
% the position depends on the chosen actuator and the current wind

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, format it's report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
