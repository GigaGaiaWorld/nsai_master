Based on the requirements, I'll generate the code for calculating the attempted flap position based on previous position, actuator used, target position, and wind effect. Here's the completed code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "A5C06F43","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),\n \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n use_actuator(Time,Actuator),\n actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),\n goal(Target),\n wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),\n Pos is PrevPos + sign(Target-PrevPos)*Strength + WindEffect."}
```

This code calculates the new attempted flap position by:
1. Getting the previous position (PrevPos)
2. Checking if goal hasn't been reached yet
3. Getting the actuator being used and its strength
4. Getting the target position (goal)
5. Getting the wind effect for current time step
6. Calculating new position as: previous position + (direction to target * actuator strength) + wind effect

The sign() function ensures we move in the correct direction toward the target.
