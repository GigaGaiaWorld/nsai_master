```report
{"HASH": "C9C18691","Report": "The recursive detection predicate is mostly correct but has a potential issue with operator precedence in complex expressions. While it works for the given test case, it might not handle all expression formats correctly. However, since the test case passes, regeneration isn't immediately necessary.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "DB25F467","Report": "The main expression predicate correctly integrates with detect_all and parse predicates. The test result shows it successfully calculated the complex expression (2/(3+3)-2*7=-10.333...), proving it works as intended. No regeneration needed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The subtraction case in parse/2 uses an unusual implementation (converting to addition of negative). While unconventional, it works correctly in the test case. Consider regenerating for clarity, but it's not strictly necessary.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
