Here's the evaluation report for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{"HASH": "99C92279","Report": "The code correctly implements implication (P â‡’ Q) as required. It succeeds when P is unprovable or Q is provable. The test results confirm it works correctly with the parent/ancestor example. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "B6292BC0","Report": "The code correctly implements negation as failure (opposite(P)) by checking that P is unprovable. The test case for opposite(parent(carol,alice)) succeeds as expected. No issues found.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "22D05CCC","Report": "The code correctly delegates to expand/2 predicates. The test case expand(double(3),6) works correctly with the defined expand rules. However, note that this is just a passthrough and depends on proper definition of expand/2 rules elsewhere in the program.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "5AFBB985","Report": "The code correctly implements set inclusion using member/2. The test case includes([a,b,c],b) succeeds as expected. This is a straightforward and correct implementation.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "62B0CEA4","Report": "The code correctly implements list extension by adding an element to the head. The test case extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]) succeeds as expected. This is a simple and correct implementation.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

Overall observations:
1. All code blocks correctly implement their specified requirements
2. All test cases pass successfully
3. No dependencies between code blocks that need regeneration
4. The meta-interpreter framework is properly integrated with all these proof predicates
5. The expand/2 implementation works correctly with the example arithmetic operations provided

The complete system appears to be functioning as intended based on the test results and code analysis. No regeneration of any code blocks is currently needed.
