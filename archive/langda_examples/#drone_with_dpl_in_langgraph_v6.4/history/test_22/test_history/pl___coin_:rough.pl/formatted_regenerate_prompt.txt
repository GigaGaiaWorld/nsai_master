System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The code block has several issues. First, there's a syntax error in the probabilistic fact declaration - 'PH::make_coin(C,PH)' is incorrect as it uses an undefined variable PH. The error message indicates a non-ground probabilistic clause, which means the probability value isn't properly specified. The coin/1 predicate should directly specify the probability (0.8) rather than using make_coin. The coins_r/3 predicate logic is mostly correct but depends on the fixed coin definition. The requirements are to sample CNT coins and count heads, which the logic attempts to do but fails due to the initial probabilistic fact error.</Report>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
