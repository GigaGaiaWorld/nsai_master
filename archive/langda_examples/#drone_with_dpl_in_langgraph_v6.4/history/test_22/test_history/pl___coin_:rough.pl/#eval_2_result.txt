{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","Report": "The code block has several issues. First, it uses 'coin_heads/1' which is not defined in the original code context, leading to the 'UnknownClause' error. Second, the requirements specify using PH::make_coin/2 for coin definition, but this implementation doesn't follow that pattern. The logic for counting heads is correct, but the coin definition needs to align with the original approach. The code needs regeneration to: 1) Use PH::make_coin/2 instead of coin_heads/1, 2) Maintain the correct counting logic, and 3) Properly integrate with the original code structure.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
