System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Code>
% -------------------------
% Basic rules of rock-paper-scissors

% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).

<Code_Block>move(scissor).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block has a minor spelling error ('scissor' should be 'scissors' for consistency with the beats predicate). While it works in the current implementation, it's better to maintain consistency.</Report>

% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(paper, rock).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>beats(scissor, paper).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block has a minor spelling inconsistency ('scissor' should be 'scissors' to match the move predicate). While it works, regeneration would improve consistency.</Report>

% Calculate the result of the game
% -------------------------
% Same gestures are considered a draw
result(X, X, draw) :-
move(X).
% If X beats Y, then X wins
result(X, Y, win) :-
beats(X, Y).
% If Y beats X, then X loses
result(X, Y, lose) :-
beats(Y, X).
% End of recursion: empty list corresponds to empty result
play([], [], []).
% Recursive advancement: take out each round of gestures, calculate the results, and continue
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
% The correct call is result(P1,P2,R), not semicolon
result(P1, P2, R),
% (Optional) Update the score according to R
play(P1T, P2T, Rs).

compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S).

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
