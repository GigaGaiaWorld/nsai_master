Here's the regenerated code in JSON form based on the analysis reports:

```problog
{"HASH": "BF964057","Code": "move(scissors)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "58D60F5E","Code": "beats(scissors, paper)."}
```

The changes made:
1. Changed 'scissor' to 'scissors' in the move predicate for consistency
2. Changed 'scissor' to 'scissors' in the beats predicate to match the corrected move predicate

These changes maintain consistency throughout the code while preserving all functionality.
