Based on the provided code and test results, here's my evaluation:

```report
{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements merge sort with proper length checking and recursive boundary conditions. It properly splits the list when length > 1 and handles the base cases. However, the test failure suggests there might be integration issues with other parts of the code. The block itself is syntactically correct and implements all required requirements.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Report": "This block is actually identical to the first one (95E704F2) in content, though it has a different hash. It correctly implements the recursive merge sort calls and merging of sorted sublists. The requirements are fully implemented. The test failure appears to be related to parsing issues in the overall file structure rather than this specific block.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

Additional observations:
1. The test error "Ambiguous token role" suggests there's a parsing issue in the overall file structure, likely due to incorrect formatting or syntax outside these code blocks.

2. The split_list/3 predicate has a potential issue - it uses append/3 in a way that might not work as intended for splitting lists. This isn't part of the evaluated blocks but could affect overall functionality.

3. The merge/3 predicates are correctly implemented and work with these blocks.

Recommendations:
1. The main issue appears to be in the file structure/formatting rather than these specific code blocks.
2. The split_list/3 predicate should be reviewed separately as it might cause issues during execution.
3. The duplicate merge_sort/2 implementation (same code with different hashes) should be consolidated.
