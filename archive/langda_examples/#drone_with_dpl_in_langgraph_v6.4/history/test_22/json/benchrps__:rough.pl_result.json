  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It maintains the same logic for determining the winner in a rock-paper-scissors game. The generated code simplifies the original by combining the result calculation into a single predicate 'play_round', which improves readability without altering the behavior. Both codes produce the same result for the given query, confirming their functional equivalence."
