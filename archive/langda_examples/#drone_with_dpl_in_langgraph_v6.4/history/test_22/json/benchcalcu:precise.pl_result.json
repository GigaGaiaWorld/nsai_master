  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it contains duplicate definitions of predicates like 'digit' and 'leftdigit', which is redundant. Second, there is a syntax error in the line 'AB + BCD =:= CDE' where the operator '=:=' is incorrectly used in a predicate definition. The original code correctly uses Prolog's arithmetic evaluation, while the generated code fails to do so properly. Additionally, the generated code includes an extra query line at the end, which is unnecessary. The error message indicates that the generated code is not valid Problog code due to these issues."
