It introduces a new predicate 'coin_heads/1' which is not defined properly, leading to an error during execution. The original code uses a simple probabilistic coin flip with a fixed probability of 0.8, while the generated code attempts to use a different approach with 'coin_heads' but fails to implement it correctly. The generated code is neither consistent with the original code nor valid in form."
