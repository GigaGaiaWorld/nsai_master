  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It includes all the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation with the helper predicates (get_top_n and insertion_sort). However, there is a redundancy in the generated code where the stack_op(sort) and get_top_n predicates are duplicated. Despite this redundancy, the functionality remains unchanged and the results are consistent with the original code."
