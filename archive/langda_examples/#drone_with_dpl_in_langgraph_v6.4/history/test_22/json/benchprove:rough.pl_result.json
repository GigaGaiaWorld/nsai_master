  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the functionality of the original code but introduces several issues. The main problems are: 1) The `implies/2` predicate is incorrectly defined as a standalone predicate rather than being integrated into the `prove/1` framework. 2) The `expand/2` predicate is incorrectly defined with `call/2`, which doesn't match the original implementation. 3) The predicates are defined as standalone rather than being part of the `prove/1` meta-interpreter. These changes make the generated code incompatible with the original's structure and execution model, leading to a timeout error during execution."
