  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there are formatting issues, particularly with line breaks and indentation, which caused a parsing error during execution. The error message indicates an 'Expected binary operator' at line 24, which suggests improper syntax handling in the generated code. Despite these issues, the core logic remains intact and would function correctly if the syntax errors were fixed."
