  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and functionality. However, there are some issues. The generated code lacks the complete implementation of the parse rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are present in the original code. Additionally, the generated code's query result is incorrect (0.0000) compared to the original code's correct result (-10.333333333333332). This indicates that the generated code does not fully meet the expectations."
