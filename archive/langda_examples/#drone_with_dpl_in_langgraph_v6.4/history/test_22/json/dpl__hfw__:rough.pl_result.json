  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the parsing rules compared to the original code, particularly in handling arithmetic operations. While the generated code is syntactically correct and runs without errors, it produces a different result (11.666...) than the original code (-10.333...). This discrepancy arises because the generated code does not properly handle operator precedence and the subtraction operation is not correctly transformed into addition with a negative value as in the original code."
