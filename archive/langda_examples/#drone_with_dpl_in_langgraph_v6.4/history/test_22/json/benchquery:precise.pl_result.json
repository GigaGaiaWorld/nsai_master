  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same functionality of querying countries with approximately equal population density. The main difference is the use of '@<' to ensure C1 is lexicographically less than C2, which prevents duplicate pairs in different orders. The mathematical conditions (20*D1 < 21*D2 and 20*D2 < 21*D1) are equivalent to the original conditions (D1 > D2, T1 is 20*D1, T2 is 21*D2, T1 < T2). The running results are consistent, showing the same country pairs with similar densities."
