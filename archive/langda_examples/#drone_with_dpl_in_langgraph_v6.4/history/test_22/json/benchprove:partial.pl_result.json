  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the essential components, including the meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, and example queries. However, there are minor formatting issues, such as unnecessary line breaks and missing comments in some sections. The functionality remains intact, and the running results are identical to the original code."
