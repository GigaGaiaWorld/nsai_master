  "final_report": "The generated code extends the functionality of the original code by introducing a 'number' predicate that can handle lists of images to form multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate that adds these multi-digit numbers. This is a valid and logical extension of the original concept. The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements of performing addition operations on multi-digit numbers represented by images. The running results are consistent with the expected behavior, correctly calculating the sum of 79 and 312 to get 391."
