  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle lists of images representing multi-digit numbers and their conversion to numerical values. It then uses this in 'multi_addition' to perform addition of these multi-digit numbers. The generated code is logically consistent with the original code's approach but handles more complex cases. Both the form and the result are valid, with the generated code correctly computing the sum of 79 and 312 to get 391."
