  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic and produces the same results as the original code. The main difference is in the implementation of the 'open_door' predicate, which is simplified in the generated code while maintaining the same functionality. The generated code is more concise and easier to understand, yet it accurately reflects the problem's requirements. Both codes correctly show a 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice and a 2/3 chance of winning by switching doors."
