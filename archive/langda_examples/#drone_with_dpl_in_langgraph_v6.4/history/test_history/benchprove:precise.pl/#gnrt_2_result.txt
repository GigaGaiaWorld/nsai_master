Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<Langda>` blocks in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "99C92279", "Code": "prove(implies(P,Q)) :-\n\t\\+ prove(P).\nprove(implies(P,Q)) :-\n\tprove(Q)."}
```

For the other `<Langda>` blocks in the original code that weren't explicitly shown (like for `opposite`, `expand`, `includes`, and `extend`), since they weren't marked with their own `<Langda>` sections in the original, I've only included the one that was explicitly requested. If you need the others as well, please provide their corresponding `<Langda>` sections from the original code.
