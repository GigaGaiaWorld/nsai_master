<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
// Inside this ```report ... ``` block, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

<Result> Here are the testing result of code:

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided code aims to parse a list of symbols representing numbers and operators into a mathematical expression and evaluate it using the `almost_equal` predicate. However, the test result shows that the evaluation failed, returning `0.0000` for the query. This indicates that the parsing logic is not correctly implemented, particularly for nested operations like division, addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The code partially meets the requirements but lacks complete functionality for handling all specified operations.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Test Failure**: The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returned `0.0000`, which is incorrect. The expected result should be `-13.6667` (i.e., `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`).

2. **Root Causes**:
   - **Missing Parse Rules**: The code only defines a `parse/2` rule for the addition operation (`+`). It lacks rules for subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`), which are required by the problem statement.
   - **Incorrect Parsing Logic**: The existing `parse/2` rule for addition does not account for operator precedence or nested operations. For example, the division and multiplication operations should be evaluated before addition and subtraction.
   - **Grounding Issues**: The `almost_equal` predicate may not handle intermediate results correctly, especially when dealing with nested operations.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Add Missing Parse Rules**: Define separate `parse/2` predicates for subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`), similar to the addition rule. For example:
   


2. **Handle Operator Precedence**: Modify the parsing logic to account for operator precedence. For example, multiplication and division should be evaluated before addition and subtraction. This may require restructuring the `parse/2` predicates or using a more sophisticated parsing approach (e.g., recursive descent parsing).

3. **Test Intermediate Results**: Ensure that the `almost_equal` predicate correctly handles intermediate results by testing it with simple expressions before integrating it into the full parsing logic.

4. **Debugging**: Use debugging tools or print statements to trace the evaluation of intermediate results and identify where the logic fails.

5. **Edge Cases**: Test the code with edge cases, such as expressions with a single number or operations with zero (e.g., division by zero).
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```

   ```prolog
   parse([N1, - | T], R) :-
       parse(T, R1),
       almost_equal(R, N1 - R1).
   parse([N1, * | T], R) :-
       parse(T, R1),
       almost_equal(R, N1 * R1).
   parse([N1, / | T], R) :-
       parse(T, R1),
       almost_equal(R, N1 / R1).
   ```
