<Evaluation_Instructions>
1. **Test Failures**: Identify which tests (from <Result>) failed and locate the source of each failure in the code (e.g., specific predicate or rule).
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of failures in the code (logical, structural, or semantic issues).
3. **Overall Analysis**: Analyze whether the overall code meets the requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
// Inside this ```report ... ``` block, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

</original_code>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code is intended to simulate a rock-paper-scissors game and determine the winner based on a series of moves by two players. The code includes predicates for defining moves, determining the result of each round, and computing the final score. However, the test results indicate a failure due to an unknown clause, suggesting a structural issue in the code. The overall logic of the code aligns with the requirements, but the implementation contains errors that prevent it from executing correctly.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Test Failure**: The error message indicates that the system encountered an unknown clause for `''->'/2'` at line 44:16. This suggests that the `determine_winner` predicate is not correctly defined or is missing a clause.
2. **Root Cause**: 
   - The `determine_winner` predicate is incomplete in the provided code. The closing parenthesis for the predicate is missing, and the predicate body is not properly formatted.
   - The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are correctly defined, but the error arises when the system tries to evaluate the `determine_winner` predicate due to its incomplete definition.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix the `determine_winner` Predicate**: Ensure the predicate is properly defined with all necessary clauses and correct syntax. The corrected version should look like this:
   

2. **Validate the Code**: After fixing the predicate, re-run the test to ensure the code executes without errors and produces the expected results.
3. **Additional Testing**: Test the code with various input combinations (e.g., different move sequences) to verify its correctness and robustness.
</Recommendations>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if itâ€™s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code is intended to simulate a rock-paper-scissors game and determine the winner based on a series of moves by two players. The code includes predicates for defining moves, determining the result of each round, and computing the final score.

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Test Failure**: The error message indicates that the system encountered an unknown clause for `''->'/2'` at line 44:16. This suggests that the `determine_winner` predicate is not correctly defined or is missing a clause.
2. **Root Cause**:

   - The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are correctly defined, but the error arises when the system tries to evaluate the `determine_winner` predicate due to its incomplete definition.
</Error_Summary>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix the `determine_winner` Predicate**: Ensure the predicate is properly defined with all necessary clauses and correct syntax. The corrected version should look like this:
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
       compute_score(Results, Score),
       (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
        Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
        Winner = 'Draw').
   ```
2. **Validate the Code**: After fixing the predicate, re-run the test to ensure the code executes without errors and produces the expected results.
3. **Additional Testing**: Test the code with various input combinations (e.g., different move sequences) to verify its correctness and robustness.
