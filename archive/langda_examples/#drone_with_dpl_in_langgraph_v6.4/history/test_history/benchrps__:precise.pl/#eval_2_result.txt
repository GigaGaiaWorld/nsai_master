  "ErrorSummary": "The 'determine_winner/3' predicate is missing a closing period (.) and causes an 'UnknownClause' error when called. The predicate definition is incomplete or malformed.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Add a closing period (.) to the 'determine_winner/3' predicate definition. Ensure the predicate is properly terminated and syntactically correct. For example:\n\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, Score),\n    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';\n     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';\n     Winner = 'Draw').",
