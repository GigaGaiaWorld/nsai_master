  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally similar to the original code, implementing insertion sort in Prolog. However, there are two issues: 1) The generated code contains a duplicate query at the end, which is unnecessary. 2) More importantly, the sorting result is incorrect ([1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7] instead of [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]), indicating a logical error in the sorting implementation. The comparison operators (@=< and @>) are correctly used, but the sorting algorithm isn't working as intended."
