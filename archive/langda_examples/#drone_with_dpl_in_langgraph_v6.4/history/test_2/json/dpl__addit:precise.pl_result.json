It introduces a 'multi_addition' predicate and a 'number' predicate that are not properly defined, and contains an unexpected character '{' which causes a parser error. The original code simply performs addition on single-digit images, while the generated code attempts to handle lists of images but fails to implement this functionality correctly. The running results are inconsistent as the original code works correctly while the generated code fails to execute."
