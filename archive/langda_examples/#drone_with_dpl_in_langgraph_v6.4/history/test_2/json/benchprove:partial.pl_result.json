Specifically, there are duplicate definitions of predicates like 'prove(implies(P,Q))' and 'prove(opposite(P))', and incorrect line breaks and periods that disrupt the Prolog syntax. These errors prevent the code from being parsed and executed correctly, as evidenced by the ParseError in the run result. The original code, on the other hand, is well-structured and runs without issues, producing the expected results."
