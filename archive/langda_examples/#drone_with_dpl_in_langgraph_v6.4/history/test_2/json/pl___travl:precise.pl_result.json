  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and rules. However, there is a minor formatting issue with a misplaced period after the 'initialInf' rule. The probabilities and rules are correctly replicated. The main difference lies in the running results, where the generated code produces significantly lower probabilities (0.0316 vs 0.1245) for the query inf(_). This discrepancy suggests that the generated code might not be capturing the same probabilistic dependencies as the original code, possibly due to the misplaced period affecting rule interpretation."
