  "final_report": "The generated code is almost identical to the original code in terms of functionality and structure. The only differences are minor formatting changes, such as the placement of periods in some of the pop/2 facts. These changes do not affect the code's execution or results. The generated code correctly implements the logic for querying countries with approximately equal population density, and the running results are consistent with the original code."
