It also does not follow the same approach as the original code, which uses sumdigit predicates to handle carry-over in the addition. The generated code attempts to solve the problem by directly calculating the numerical values of 'SEND', 'MORE', and 'MONEY', but fails to execute properly. The original code successfully finds a solution, while the generated code does not run at all."
