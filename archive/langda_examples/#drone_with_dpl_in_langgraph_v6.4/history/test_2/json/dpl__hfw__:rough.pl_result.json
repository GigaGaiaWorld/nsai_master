  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the parsing logic compared to the original code, particularly in handling subtraction and multiplication operations. While the generated code is syntactically correct and runs without errors, it produces a different result (-0.25) compared to the original code's result (-10.333333333333332). This discrepancy arises because the generated code processes operations with a different precedence and grouping strategy. The original code handles subtraction by converting it to addition with a negative multiplication, which affects the final result."
