  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. Both codes produce the same sorted output for the given input. However, the generated code uses a different approach for splitting the list (alternating elements) compared to the original code (splitting into two halves of equal length). Despite this difference, both implementations are valid and produce consistent results."
