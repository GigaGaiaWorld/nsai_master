  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference is in the formatting and the placement of the 'Old \\= GP' condition in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, which was moved to a different line but does not affect the logic. The generated code maintains all the essential components of the original, including the actuator strength definitions, wind effect model, and goal checking mechanism. Both codes produce identical results when run, indicating that the changes in the generated code do not impact the program's behavior."
