  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of stack operations. It includes all the original operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and adds a sort operation with helper predicates. However, there is a discrepancy in the 'rot' operation implementation. The original code rotates the top three elements as [Z,X,Y|Stack], while the generated code does it as [Y,Z,X|Stack]. The generated code also includes duplicate definitions of 'stack_op(sort)' and 'get_top_n', which is redundant but doesn't affect functionality. The running results differ only in the 'rot' operation, as expected from the implementation difference."
