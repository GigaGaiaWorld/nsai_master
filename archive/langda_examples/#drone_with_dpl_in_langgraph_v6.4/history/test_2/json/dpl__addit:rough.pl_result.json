  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of images into a multi-digit number and performs addition. This is a valid extension and maintains consistency with the original code's logic. The generated code correctly implements the new functionality, as evidenced by the correct result (79 + 231 = 310). Both the form and result are valid."
