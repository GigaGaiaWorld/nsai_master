  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the core functionalities including the meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, and examples. However, there is a significant difference in the 'implies/2' implementation. The original code correctly implements P ⇒ Q as 'P is unprovable or Q is provable', while the generated code incorrectly implements it as 'P and Q must both be provable'. Despite this logical difference, the running results are consistent for the given queries because the specific queries happen to satisfy both implementations in this case."
