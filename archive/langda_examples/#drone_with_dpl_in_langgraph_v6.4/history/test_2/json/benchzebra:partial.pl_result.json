  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code, but there is a minor discrepancy in the predicate 'my_member(house(_, _, snail, _, winstons), Houses)' where 'snail' should be 'snails' to match the original code. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same solution to the zebra puzzle. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, except for the mentioned typo."
