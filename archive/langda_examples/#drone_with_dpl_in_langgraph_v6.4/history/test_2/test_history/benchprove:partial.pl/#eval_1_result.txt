Here is the evaluation report for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
    "HASH": "99C92279",
    "Report": "The code 'prove(implies(P,Q)) :- (\\+ prove(P); prove(Q)).' correctly implements the logical implication P â‡’ Q, where the implication holds if either P is unprovable (\\+ prove(P)) or Q is provable (prove(Q)). The syntax is valid Prolog/DeepProblog.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "1405B337",
    "Report": "The code 'prove(opposite(P)) :- \\+ prove(P).' correctly defines the opposite/negation of P by checking that P is unprovable. The syntax is valid Prolog/DeepProblog.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "C68F7B35",
    "Report": "The code 'prove(extend(List,Elem,Extended)) :- Extended = [Elem|List].' correctly implements list extension by adding Elem to the head of List. The syntax is valid Prolog/DeepProblog.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "0F69CE0F",
    "Report": "The code 'expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.' correctly defines a predicate that calculates Y as double of X. The syntax is valid Prolog/DeepProblog.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

Note: The error message shown in the test results appears to be related to operator priority in a different part of the code (not shown in the provided code blocks). All the evaluated code blocks are syntactically correct and meet their specified requirements.
