    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the specified requirements for the inf/1 predicate. It includes rules for initial infection (0.1 probability), contact transmission (0.6 probability for non-susceptible individuals and 0.8 for susceptible ones), and travel risk (0.2 probability). The syntax and logic are valid for DeepProblog. The inference results (inf(a) = 0.0316, inf(b) = 0.0316) suggest the rules are functioning as intended.",
