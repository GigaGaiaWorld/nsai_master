Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X).\n0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X)."}
```

Note that I've included the additional rule `0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).` from the generated_code that addresses the missing initial infection probability mentioned in the report. This completes the requirements specified in the LLM section of the original code.
