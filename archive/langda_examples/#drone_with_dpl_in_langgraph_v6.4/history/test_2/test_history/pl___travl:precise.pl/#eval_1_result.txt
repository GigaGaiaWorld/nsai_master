    "Report": "The code block partially meets the requirements but has some issues. The requirements specify an initial infection probability of 0.1, which is missing in the code. The contact transmission rules (0.6 for non-susceptible and 0.8 for susceptible) are correctly implemented. The travel risk rule (0.2 probability) is also correctly implemented. However, the initial infection probability should be added for completeness.",
