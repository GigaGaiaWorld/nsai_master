Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> blocks in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "C5B4A895","Code": "0.5::open_door(A), 0.5::open_door(B) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    A \= Selected,
    B \= Selected,
    A \= B,
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ prize(B)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "","Code": "open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    A \= Selected,
    \+ prize(A)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "","Code": "win_keep :-
    select_door(Selected),
    prize(Selected)."}
```

Note: The second and third blocks don't have hash values in the original code, so I've left the "HASH" field empty for them. The first block includes the corrected version of the code (with the semicolon replaced by a comma as per the report).
