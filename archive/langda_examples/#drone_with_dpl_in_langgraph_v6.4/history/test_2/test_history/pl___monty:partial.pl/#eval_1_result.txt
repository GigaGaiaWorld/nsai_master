Here are the reports for each code block in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "C5B4A895",
    "Report": "The code has a syntax error in the probability declaration. The semicolon (;) should be a comma (,) to properly separate the probabilistic choices. The logic correctly implements the requirement to randomly open one of two unselected, non-prize doors when both are empty. The conditions properly check for different doors that aren't selected and don't contain prizes.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "338175EC",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the requirement to open the unselected door without a prize when the other unselected door has a prize. The conditions properly check for doors that aren't selected, with one containing a prize and the other not. The logic is sound and matches the described behavior.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

For the third Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "B73E5085",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the winning condition for keeping the original selection. It simply checks if the selected door contains the prize, which perfectly matches the described requirement. The logic is straightforward and correct.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```
