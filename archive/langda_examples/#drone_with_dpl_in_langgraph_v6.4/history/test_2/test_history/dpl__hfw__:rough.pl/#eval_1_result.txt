    "Report": "The code implements a recursive expression evaluator (parse/2) that correctly handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The base case (parse([N], N)) correctly handles single-number expressions. The recursive cases properly handle each operator by recursively evaluating the rest of the list and applying the appropriate arithmetic operation. The code matches the requirements perfectly and appears to be functionally correct based on the given test result (expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],-0.25) = 1.0000).",
