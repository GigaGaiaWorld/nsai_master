System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n % Problog Inference Resultï¼š\nexpression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],-0.25) = 1.0000</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>parse([N], N).\nparse([N, + | Rest], Result) :-\n    parse(Rest, RestResult),\n    Result is N + RestResult.\nparse([N, - | Rest], Result) :-\n    parse(Rest, RestResult),\n    Result is N - RestResult.\nparse([N, * | Rest], Result) :-\n    parse(Rest, RestResult),\n    Result is N * RestResult.\nparse([N, / | Rest], Result) :-\n    parse(Rest, RestResult),\n    Result is N / RestResult.</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: 190031BC </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Recursive expression evaluator: parse/2, which can perform the following operations:  Addition processing  Subtraction processing  Multiplication processing  Division processing. </LLM></Langda>']

Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
