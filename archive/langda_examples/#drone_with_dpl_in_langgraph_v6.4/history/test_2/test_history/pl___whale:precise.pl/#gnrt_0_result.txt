Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE","Code": "gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)"}
```

This is the exact content that replaced the <Langda> block in the original code, fulfilling the requirements specified in the LLM section of the placeholder. The completed code snippet implements the rule that when the adult sperm whale (ID 2) has gender S, the orca (ID 3) has gender O, and the adult sperm whale is at position c, it means the adult sperm whale abandons the calf.
