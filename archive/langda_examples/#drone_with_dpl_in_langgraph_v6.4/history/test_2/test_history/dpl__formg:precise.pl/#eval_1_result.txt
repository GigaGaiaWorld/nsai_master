Here are the evaluation reports for the provided code blocks in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "95E704F2",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the required rules: 1. It gets the length of the list using length/2 predicate. 2. It properly checks the recursive boundary with Len > 1 condition. 3. It splits the list into Left and Right parts using split_list/3. The code is valid and meets all requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "26E82D5D",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the required rules: 1. It recursively sorts the left half with merge_sort/2. 2. It recursively sorts the right half with merge_sort/2. 3. It merges the sorted sublists using merge/3. The code is valid and meets all requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```
