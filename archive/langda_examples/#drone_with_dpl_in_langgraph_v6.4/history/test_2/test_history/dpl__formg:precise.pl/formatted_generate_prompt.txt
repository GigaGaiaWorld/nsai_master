System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.

merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
 
<Langda> Information of 1st Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 95E704F2 </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Should contain following rules: 1.Get the length of the current list, Len, to determine whether to continue splitting. 2.Recursive boundary judgment: Only lists with a length greater than 1 need to be sorted, otherwise they are sorted by default. 3.Split the list into two parts, Left and Right, for subsequent recursive processing. </LLM></Langda>
,
 
<Langda> Information of 2nd Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 26E82D5D </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Should contain following rules: 1.Recursively call merge sort on the left half, and the result is SortedLeft. 2.Recursively sort the right half, and the result is SortedRight. 3.Merge the two sorted sublists into the final sorted result Sorted. </LLM></Langda>

split_list(List, Left, Right) :-
 length(List, Len),
 Half is Len // 2,
 length(Left, Half),
 append(Left, Right, List).
merge([], List, List).
merge(List, [], List).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H1|Merged]) :-
 H1 =< H2,
 merge(T1, [H2|T2], Merged).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H2|Merged]) :-
 H1 > H2,
 merge([H1|T1], T2, Merged).
 
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
</Code>
<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here
```

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

<Final_Answer> Each code block SHOULD ONLY CONTAINS THE EXACT CONTENT of <langda> blocks, for example:
for the following original code:
<Code>
head(X) :-
<Langda> Information of 1st Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: XXXXABCD </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules:...  </LLM></Langda>
//other contents...
</Code>
if you extracted code contains "head(X) :-", it's wrong, because it's OUTSIDE the <langda> block

For each code block , extract it and format it as follows:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
