    "Report": "The code block defines a rule for compute_score when the first element of the list is 'lose'. It recursively processes the remaining elements of the list (Rs) and decrements the score (S) by 1. This logic correctly implements the lose case for score computation, as evidenced by the successful Problog inference result where player2 wins with a probability of 1.0000 when their moves counter the opponent's moves.",
