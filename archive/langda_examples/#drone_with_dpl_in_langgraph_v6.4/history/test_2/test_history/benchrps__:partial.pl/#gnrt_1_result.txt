Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> blocks in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "94C4D48B","Code": "compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "","Code": "beats(paper, rock).\nbeats(scissor, paper)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "","Code": ""}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "","Code": "compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "","Code": ""}
```

Note: For blocks without a HASH tag in the original code, I've left the HASH field empty. Also, empty <langda> blocks are represented with empty Code fields.
