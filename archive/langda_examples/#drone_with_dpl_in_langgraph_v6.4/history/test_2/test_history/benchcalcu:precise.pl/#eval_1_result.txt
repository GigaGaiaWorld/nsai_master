Here is the evaluation report for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
    "HASH": "B6FD3E20",
    "Report": "The code correctly specifies that D and E must be different digits, which is valid for ensuring distinct digits in the SEND+MORE=MONEY puzzle. The constraint D \\= E is properly used.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "AFCFFD3D",
    "Report": "The code 'sumdigit(0, D, E, Y, C1)' correctly sets up the unit digit addition with initial carry 0, and calculates Y and C1 from D + E. This matches the requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "BA7F9BE8",
    "Report": "The code correctly assigns a value to N and ensures it is different from Y, E, D using all_different/1. This maintains the puzzle's uniqueness constraints.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "3E567069",
    "Report": "The code properly assigns R and enforces uniqueness against N, Y, E, D. This is valid for the puzzle's requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "0BCA612F",
    "Report": "The code 'sumdigit(C1, N, R, E, C2)' correctly models the tens digit addition: N + R + C1 = E with carry C2. This is accurate for the puzzle.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "710BBD98",
    "Report": "The code correctly assigns O and ensures it is unique among R, N, Y, E, D. This maintains the puzzle's constraints.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "58F57C1C",
    "Report": "The code 'sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3)' accurately models the hundreds digit addition: E + O + C2 = N with carry C3. This is correct.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "70805326",
    "Report": "The code correctly assigns S as a left digit (non-zero) and ensures uniqueness among O, R, N, Y, E, D. This fits the puzzle's requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "72F32859",
    "Report": "The code correctly assigns M as a left digit (non-zero) and ensures uniqueness among S, O, R, N, Y, E, D. This is valid for the puzzle.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "4623869C",
    "Report": "The code 'sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)' correctly models the thousands digit addition: S + M + C3 = O, with the carry constrained to M (the highest digit). This is accurate for the puzzle's final constraint.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
