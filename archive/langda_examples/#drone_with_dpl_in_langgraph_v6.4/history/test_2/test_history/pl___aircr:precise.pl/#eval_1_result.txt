    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements for calculating the new flap position. It follows the steps: 1) Gets previous position (Old), 2) Checks if Old is not at target (GP), 3) Uses an actuator (A) with strength (AS), 4) Calculates ideal movement (AE) using sign function and actuator strength, 5) Incorporates wind effect (WE), and 6) Computes new position (Pos) by combining Old, AE, and WE. The logic aligns perfectly with the specified requirements.",
