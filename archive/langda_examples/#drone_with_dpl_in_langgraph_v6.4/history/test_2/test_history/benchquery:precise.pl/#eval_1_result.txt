Here are the evaluation reports for the provided code blocks:

```report
{
    "HASH": "A37F4273",
    "Report": "The first code block correctly implements the requirements for finding countries with approximately equal population density. It uses the inequality 20×D1 < 21×D2 to approximate D1/D2 < 1.05, which avoids division and decimals as required. The code also ensures unique pairs with C1 @< C2. The test results show correct outputs in the format [C1,D1,C2,D2], matching the expected behavior.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "3A3D0149",
    "Report": "The second code block correctly implements the population density calculation as specified. It uses pop/2 and area/2 facts, multiplies population by 100, and performs floor division with the area. This matches the requirement of calculating integer population density. The calculation method is appropriate for the task and produces correct results when used with the first code block.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
