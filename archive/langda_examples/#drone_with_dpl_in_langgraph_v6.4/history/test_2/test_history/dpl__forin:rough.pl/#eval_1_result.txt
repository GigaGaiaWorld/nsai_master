    "Report": "The provided Prolog code correctly implements an insertion sort algorithm. The code consists of two main predicates: 'insert/3' for inserting an element into a sorted list, and 'insertion_sort/2' for sorting a list using insertion sort. The base cases and recursive cases are properly defined, and the example query demonstrates correct usage. The code is interpretable and meets the requirements of implementing an insertion_sort/2 algorithm. The test result shows correct sorting functionality with probability 1.0000.",
