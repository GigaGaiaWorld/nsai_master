    "Report": "The code block implements all required features for the prove/1 predicate as specified in the requirements. It correctly handles:\n1. implies/2 - correctly implements logical implication\n2. opposite/1 - properly implements negation using \\+\n3. expand/2 - delegates to an expand/2 predicate (though the actual expand/2 implementation isn't shown)\n4. includes/2 - correctly uses member/2 to check list membership\n5. extend/2 - properly prepends an element to a list\n6. refute/1 - correctly implements as negation (same as opposite/1)\n\nThe code matches all test cases shown in the results, producing the expected outputs. The implementation is clean and follows logical programming conventions.",
