System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
 swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
 swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):-
 hole(H1,H2,X1,X2),
 bubble([X2|T],T1,X).
bubblesort([],L,L).
bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :-

<Final_Answer> Each code block SHOULD ONLY CONTAINS THE EXACT CONTENT of <langda> blocks, for example:
for the following original code:
<Code>
head(X) :-
<Langda> Information of 1st Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: XXXXABCD </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules:...  </LLM></Langda>
//other contents...
</Code>
if you extracted code contains "head(X) :-", it's wrong, because it's OUTSIDE the <langda> block

For each code block , extract it and format it as follows:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
