Here are the reports for the provided code blocks in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "2971FD2F",
    "Report": "The code snippet shows a recursive call to bubblesort but is incomplete and potentially incorrect. It references variables L, L2, X, and L3 without showing their initialization or how they relate to each other. The recursive structure appears to be attempting a bubble sort by moving the maximum element to the front, but the implementation is unclear and lacks proper base cases.",
    "Need_regenerate": "true"
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "5CBF7C6A",
    "Report": "The swap predicate is correctly implemented with two clauses that handle both cases of swapping (when X > Y) and not swapping (when X =< Y). The logic is clear and correctly implements the requirements for determining whether to exchange elements.",
    "Need_regenerate": "false"
}
```
