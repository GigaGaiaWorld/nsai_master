Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code blocks that correspond to the <langda> blocks:

1. For the first <langda> block (hash 766936E0), the completed code was already provided in the <Current_Code> section, so no extraction is needed from generated_code.

2. For the second placeholder (team_strength for multiple players):
```problog
{"HASH": "{{LANGDA}}","Code": "strength(P,G,S1),\n    team_strength([P2|L],G,S2),\n    min(S1,S2,S)."}
```

3. For the third placeholder (wins condition):
```problog
{"HASH": "{{LANGDA}}","Code": "team_strength(T1,G,S1),\n    team_strength(T2,G,S2),\n    S1 > S2."}
```
