    "Report": "The current code 'team_strength([P],G,S) :- strength(P,G,S).' is not correctly implementing the requirement of calculating team strength as the minimum of all members' strengths. The code only handles a single player case and doesn't implement the minimum operation for multiple players. Additionally, there appears to be a typo in the predicate name 'team_strength' (missing an 'e').",
