Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder:

```problog
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Code": "multi_addition(X, Y, Z) :-\n    number(X, XNum),\n    number(Y, YNum),\n    Z is XNum + YNum."}
```

Note that this is the exact code that was generated to replace the <langda> placeholder in the original code, and it matches the hash tag provided in the original placeholder (4A9D0B2A). The extraction doesn't include any surrounding code that wasn't part of the <langda> block.
