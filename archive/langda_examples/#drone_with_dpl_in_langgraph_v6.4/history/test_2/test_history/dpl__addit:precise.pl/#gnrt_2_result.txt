Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder:

```problog
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Code": "multi_addition(X, Y, Z) :-\n    number(X, XNum),\n    number(Y, YNum),\n    Z is XNum + YNum."}
```

Note that this is the exact code that was in the <Current_Code> section of the <langda> block, which was completed in the generated_code. The other code in generated_code (like the number/3 predicate) wasn't part of the <langda> block in the origin_code, so it's not included here.
