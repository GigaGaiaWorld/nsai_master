    "Report": "The code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog correctly. The operations include push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot, and sort. Each operation is defined with clear rules that manipulate the stack as expected. The helper predicates for the sort operation (get_top_n and insertion_sort) are also correctly implemented. The testing results provided confirm that the operations work as intended. The code is well-structured and follows ProbLog syntax conventions.",
