Here are the reports for each code block in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "3F277A35",
    "Report": "The code 'move(X).' is too generic and doesn't implement the required rule about same gestures being a draw. It just defines a predicate for moves without any logic for comparison. Needs proper implementation to handle game rules.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "D91BB7A0",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(X, Y).' is incomplete as it doesn't define the actual winning conditions (e.g., paper beats rock). It needs concrete facts defining which moves beat which other moves.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the third Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "0940BB04",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(Y, X).' is similarly incomplete as the second block. While it correctly shows the inverse relationship (if Y beats X then X loses), it still lacks the concrete move definitions needed for the game logic.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```
