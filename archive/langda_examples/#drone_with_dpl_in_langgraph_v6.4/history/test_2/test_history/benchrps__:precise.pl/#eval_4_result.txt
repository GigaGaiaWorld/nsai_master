Here's the JSON report for each code block:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "3F277A35",
    "Report": "The code 'move(X).' is incomplete and doesn't implement the required rule about same gestures being a draw. It only declares a predicate for moves without any rules or facts about the game outcomes.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "D91BB7A0",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(X, Y).' is incomplete as a standalone statement. While it declares the predicate correctly, it lacks the actual facts that define which moves beat others (e.g., paper beats rock). The predicate name matches the requirement but implementation is missing.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the third Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "0940BB04",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(Y, X).' is similarly incomplete as the second block. While the predicate is correctly named, it's just a declaration without the actual game rules. The comment suggests it should handle losing cases, but this would be better handled through proper rule definitions rather than just predicate declarations.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```
