Here is the evaluation report in JSON format for each code block:

```report
{
    "HASH": "3F277A35",
    "Report": "The code 'move(X).' is incomplete and doesn't implement the required rule for same gestures being a draw. It needs to define specific moves (rock, paper, scissor) and handle draw conditions.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "D91BB7A0",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(X, Y).' is incomplete. It needs concrete rules defining which moves beat others (e.g., beats(paper, rock), beats(rock, scissor), etc.) to satisfy the requirement that if X beats Y, then X wins.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "0940BB04",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(Y, X).' is similarly incomplete as the previous beats predicate. It needs the same concrete rules to properly handle the inverse case where Y beats X means X loses.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "583E41B6",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the recursive score calculation for 'win' results. It properly adds 1 to player1's score when a win is encountered in the results list.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "D324979D",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the recursive score calculation for 'lose' results. It properly subtracts 1 (equivalent to adding 1 to player2) when a lose is encountered in the results list.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "FD850DEC",
    "Report": "The code correctly handles 'draw' results by maintaining the current score without modification, which matches the requirement that draws shouldn't affect the score.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "3FEB17D7",
    "Report": "The main predicate structure is correct for determining the winner based on the computed score. However, it depends on the play/3 predicate which isn't shown in the provided code blocks. The logic for comparing scores and determining the winner is properly implemented.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
