Here are the evaluation reports for each code block in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "3F277A35",
    "Report": "The code 'move(X).' is incomplete and doesn't implement the required rule about same gestures being a draw. It only declares a predicate for moves without any implementation of game logic.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "D91BB7A0",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(X, Y).' is incomplete as a standalone statement. While it declares the predicate correctly, it lacks the concrete rules that define which moves beat others (e.g., paper beats rock).",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the third Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "0940BB04",
    "Report": "The code 'beats(Y, X).' is similarly incomplete as the second block. While it's meant to handle the inverse case, it lacks concrete implementation of the game rules. The comment suggests correct intention but needs proper implementation.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```
