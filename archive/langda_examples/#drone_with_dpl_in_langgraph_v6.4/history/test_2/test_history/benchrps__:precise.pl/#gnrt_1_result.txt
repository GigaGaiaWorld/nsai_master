Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> blocks in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "3F277A35","Code": "move(X)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "D91BB7A0","Code": "beats(X, Y)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "0940BB04","Code": "beats(Y, X)."}
```

Note: The generated code shows completed implementations (like `result(X, X, draw) :- move(X).`), but according to the instructions, we should only extract the exact content that was inside the <langda> blocks, which are the incomplete versions shown above. The completed versions in the generated code are outside the scope of what we're supposed to extract.
