Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block:

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E","Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-\n    get_top_n(Stack, 3, [X,Y,Z], Rest),\n    sort([X,Y,Z], SortedElements),\n    append(SortedElements, Rest, SortedStack)."}
```

This is the only code block that was originally marked with <langda> tags in the origin_code, and it has been completed in the generated_code. The extracted portion matches exactly the content that was previously incomplete in the <langda> block.
