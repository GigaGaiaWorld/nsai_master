Here is the evaluation report in JSON format for each code block:

```report
{
    "HASH": "D38F9F68",
    "Report": "The first code block defines a predicate game/4 that correctly distributes cards between player and opponent, and calculates their best hands. The logic matches the requirements of distributing first two cards to player (own) and last two to opponent, then determining best hands H1 and H2. The syntax appears valid for Problog.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "EF02D81B",
    "Report": "The second code block has syntax issues. It references variables OwnCards and OpponentCards that aren't defined in its scope (they were local to game/4). Also, it tries to use game/4 but doesn't properly handle its outputs. The error message shows an operator priority clash, likely due to these scope/variable issues. The logic for comparing ranks is correct in concept but improperly implemented.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "C53A4763",
    "Report": "The third code block is syntactically correct and implements the required logic of randomly selecting a House card from house_rank/1 distribution before calling game/3. The chaining of predicates is properly done and matches the requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
