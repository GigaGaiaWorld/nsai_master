System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n Error evaluating Problog model:\n    rf = self.fold(\n         ^^^^^^^^^^\n  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1101, in fold\n    raise ParseError(\nproblog.parser.ParseError: Operator priority clash at 54:25.</Result>', "<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>cards(Cards,own,House,OwnCards),\n    cards(Cards,opponent,House,OpponentCards),\n    best_hand_rank(OwnCards,R1),\n    best_hand_rank(OpponentCards,R2),\n    outcome(R1,R2,Outcome).</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: EF02D81B </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Similar to the above, but only returns the result Outcome âˆˆ {win, loss, draw}, Determine the winner by comparing the rank values \u200b\u200bof the player and opponent's best cards. </LLM></Langda>"]

<requirements>
Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
