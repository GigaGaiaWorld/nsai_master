Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code blocks that correspond to the <langda> placeholders:

```problog
{"HASH": "EF02D81B","Code": "cards(Cards,own,House,OwnCards),\n    cards(Cards,opponent,House,OpponentCards),\n    best_hand_rank(OwnCards,R1),\n    best_hand_rank(OpponentCards,R2),\n    outcome(R1,R2,Outcome)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "","Code": "house_rank(House),\n    game(Cards,House,Outcome)."}
```

Note that the second code block didn't have a hash in the original code, so I've left that field empty. Both extracted code blocks contain only the exact content that would replace the {{LANGDA}} placeholders in the original code.
