    "Report": "The provided code is a valid Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. It correctly implements the following components:\n1. Base cases for empty list and single-element list\n2. Recursive case that splits, sorts, and merges\n3. Proper splitting logic that divides the list into two halves\n4. Correct merging logic for sorted lists\n\nThe code matches the requirements of implementing an interpretable merge_sort/2 algorithm. The test result shows it correctly sorts [3,1,2,5,7,12] to [1,2,3,5,7,12] with probability 1.0000, confirming its functionality.",
