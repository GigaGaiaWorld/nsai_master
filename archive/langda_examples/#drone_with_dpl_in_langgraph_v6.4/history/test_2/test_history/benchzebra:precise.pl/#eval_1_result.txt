    "Report": "The provided code block appears to be a description of a logic puzzle (similar to Einstein's Riddle) rather than valid DeepProbLog code. The error message indicates that the parser expected binary operators, which suggests the current format is not syntactically correct for DeepProbLog. The content describes house arrangement rules but doesn't follow DeepProbLog syntax conventions. To make this work in DeepProbLog, the rules would need to be rewritten using proper probabilistic logic programming syntax with predicates, variables, and proper logical operators.",
