    "Report": "The code block appears to be a valid Prolog-style representation of the Einstein's Zebra Puzzle (also known as the Einstein's Riddle). It correctly encodes all the given constraints about house colors, nationalities, pets, drinks, and cigarettes. However, the error message indicates that the 'member/2' predicate is not defined in the Problog environment. In Problog/DeepProblog, you would need to either define this predicate or use built-in alternatives. The logic itself is correct for the puzzle, but the implementation needs adjustment for Problog syntax.",
