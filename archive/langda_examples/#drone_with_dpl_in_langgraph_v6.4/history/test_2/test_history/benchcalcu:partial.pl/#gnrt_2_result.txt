Based on the instructions, I'll extract and format only the exact content that was inside the <Langda> block from the original code, which corresponds to the completed code in the generated version.

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900","Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),
 sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),
 
 digit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),
 sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),
 
 digit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),
 sumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, _)."}
