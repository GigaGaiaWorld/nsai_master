System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n Error evaluating Problog model:\n  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_builtin.py", line 887, in _builtin_is\n    check_mode((a, b), ["*g"], functor="is", **k)\n  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_builtin.py", line 630, in check_mode\n    raise CallModeError(functor, args, accepted, location=location)\nproblog.engine_builtin.CallModeError: Invalid argument types for call to \'is/2\': arguments: (X1, 0+X2+0), expected: (any, ground) at 24:4.</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n \n digit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n \n digit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\n sumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, _).</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: 1039E900 </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: complete the predicate logic. </LLM></Langda>']

Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
