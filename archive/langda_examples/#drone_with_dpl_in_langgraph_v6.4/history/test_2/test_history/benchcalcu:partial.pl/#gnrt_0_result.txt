Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code has hash "1039E900" and requires completing the predicate logic. The corresponding completed code in generated_code is:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900","Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n \n digit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\n sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n \n digit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\n sumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, _)."}
