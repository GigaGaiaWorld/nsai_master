    "Report": "The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, but there are several issues that need to be addressed. The main error in the execution indicates that there are no clauses found for a certain predicate, which suggests there might be a syntax or logical error in the code. Specifically, the error 'No clauses found for \'\'->\'/2\' at 9:21' points to a problem with the conditional statement in the bubblesort predicate. The conditional syntax (Swapped = true -> ... ; ...) might not be correctly interpreted in the ProbLog environment. Additionally, the bubble_pass predicate has some logical inconsistencies in how it handles the swapping and propagation of the Swapped flag. The code needs to be revised to ensure proper conditional handling and correct propagation of the swap flag through the recursion.",
