    "Report": "The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog with three main predicates: bubblesort/3, bubble_pass/3, and append/3. The code structure is logically correct for a bubble sort implementation, with proper base cases and recursive cases. However, the error message indicates that the Problog engine cannot find clauses for an empty predicate ('/2'). This suggests there might be a missing predicate or a syntax issue when the code is being executed in the Problog environment. The bubblesort logic itself is correct for standard Prolog, but may need adaptation for Problog's probabilistic context.",
