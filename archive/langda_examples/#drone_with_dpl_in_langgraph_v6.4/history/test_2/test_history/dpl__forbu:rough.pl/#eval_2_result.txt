    "Report": "The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, but it contains several issues that prevent it from working correctly in DeepProbLog. The main error shown in the testing result indicates that the engine cannot find clauses for a certain predicate, likely due to syntax or structural problems. The bubblesort implementation itself appears logically correct for standard Prolog, but may need adaptation for DeepProbLog's probabilistic context. The bubble_pass/3 predicate has correct comparison logic but may need adjustment for DeepProbLog's execution model. The forth_sort/2 wrapper predicate is properly defined but needs to be compatible with DeepProbLog's query mechanism.",
