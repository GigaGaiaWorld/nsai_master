    "Report": "The code snippet shows a recursive approach to insertion sort in Prolog. It correctly follows the requirements: 1. It recursively sorts the tail list (insertion_sort(T, SortedTail)), and 2. It inserts the head element H into the sorted list (insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted)). The test result shows successful sorting of the input list [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12] to [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] with 100% probability, indicating the code works as intended.",
