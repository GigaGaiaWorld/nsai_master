    "Report": "The code attempts to define the open_door/1 predicate with probabilistic behavior for the Monty Hall problem. However, there are several issues:\n1. The error indicates 'No clauses found' which suggests the predicate isn't properly defined or called.\n2. The syntax for probabilistic facts in Problog should use '::' directly with facts, not in conditional statements.\n3. The conditions are complex and might not be properly handled by Problog's inference engine.\n4. The 'fail' case isn't properly handled as a probabilistic outcome.\n\nThe logic conceptually matches the requirements (random door opening with 50% probability in some cases, deterministic in others), but the implementation is syntactically incorrect for Problog.",
