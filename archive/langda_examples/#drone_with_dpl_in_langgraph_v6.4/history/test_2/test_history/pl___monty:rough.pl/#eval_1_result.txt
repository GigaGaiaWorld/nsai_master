    "Report": "The code attempts to define the open_door/1 predicate with probabilistic behavior for the Monty Hall problem. However, there are several issues:\n1. The syntax is incorrect for DeepProblog/ProbLog - the '->' operator is not properly used for conditional probabilities\n2. The 'fail' case is not correctly implemented for probabilistic logic\n3. The structure doesn't properly handle all cases of door selection and prize placement\n4. The error message indicates the engine cannot find clauses for this predicate\n5. The probability assignments (0.5::open_door(D)) are not correctly formatted for ProbLog syntax",
