    "Report": "The code defines the open_door/1 predicate with probabilistic and deterministic rules for the Monty Hall problem. However, there are several issues:\n1. The error suggests the predicate '/2' is not found, indicating a syntax or structural problem.\n2. The conditions using '\\=' and '=:=' are correct for inequality/equality checks.\n3. The probabilistic rules (0.5::open_door(D)) are correctly specified for random door opening.\n4. The 'fail' case correctly handles the deterministic empty door scenario.\n5. The structure could be improved by separating the probabilistic and deterministic cases more clearly.",
