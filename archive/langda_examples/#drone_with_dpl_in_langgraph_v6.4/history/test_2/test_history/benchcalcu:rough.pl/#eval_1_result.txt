Here are the reports for the provided code blocks:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "11FB8FD3",
    "Report": "The code appears to be attempting to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (SEND + MORE = MONEY). However, it's missing crucial predicate definitions (leftdigit/1, digit/1, all_different/1) and proper Problog syntax. The error shows these predicates are undefined. The code needs to be properly structured as a Problog program with proper predicate definitions and syntax.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "9D7ABC12",
    "Report": "This code block is identical to the first one and suffers from the same issues. It's missing predicate definitions and proper Problog syntax structure. While the LLM mentions 'additional rules to complete query_sum/1', these aren't reflected in the actual code. The code needs complete restructuring with proper predicate definitions and syntax to work as a Problog program.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
