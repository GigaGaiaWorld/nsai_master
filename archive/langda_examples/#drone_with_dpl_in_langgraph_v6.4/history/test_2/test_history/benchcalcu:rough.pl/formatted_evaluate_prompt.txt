System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n Error evaluating Problog model:\n    rf = self.fold(\n         ^^^^^^^^^^\n  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1101, in fold\n    raise ParseError(\nproblog.parser.ParseError: Operator priority clash at 5:40.</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>query_sum([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]) :-\n    leftdigit(S),\n    leftdigit(M),\n    digit(E), digit(N), digit(D), digit(O), digit(R), digit(Y),\n    all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\n    Send is 1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D,\n    More is 1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E,\n    Money is 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y,\n    Money is Send + More.</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: 9D7ABC12 </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: additional rules to complete query_sum/1 </LLM></Langda>']

Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
