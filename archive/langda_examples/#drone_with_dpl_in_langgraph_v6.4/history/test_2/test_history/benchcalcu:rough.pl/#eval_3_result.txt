Here are the reports for the provided code blocks:

```report
{
    "HASH": "11FB8FD3",
    "Report": "The code implements a cryptarithmetic puzzle solver for CROSS + ROADS = DANGER. The structure is correct with proper digit constraints (leftdigit for leading letters and digit for others) and all_different constraint. The arithmetic expressions for converting letters to numbers are correctly implemented. The error in the test result appears to be unrelated to this specific code block - it seems to be a parsing error in the Problog environment rather than a problem with this logic.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "9D7ABC12",
    "Report": "This code block is identical to the first one (same cryptarithmetic puzzle implementation). The LLM note mentions 'additional rules to complete query_sum/1' but no additional rules are actually provided. The code itself is correct for solving the puzzle but doesn't include any additional rules as suggested by the comment. The same parsing error would likely occur with this code as with the first block.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
