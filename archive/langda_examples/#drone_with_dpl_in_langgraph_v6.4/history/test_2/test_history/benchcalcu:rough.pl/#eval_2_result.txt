Here are the reports for each code block:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "11FB8FD3",
    "Report": "The code appears to be attempting to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (SEND + MORE = MONEY). However, it's missing proper Problog syntax and predicate definitions. The error indicates the code is being interpreted as facts rather than proper rules. The code needs proper predicate definitions for 'leftdigit' and 'digit', and should be wrapped in proper Problog query syntax. The requirements mention a different puzzle (CROSS + ROADS = DANGER), so this doesn't match the stated requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "9D7ABC12",
    "Report": "This code block is identical to the first one and suffers from the same issues. It's attempting to solve SEND+MORE=MONEY puzzle but lacks proper Problog syntax and predicate definitions. The requirements mention 'additional rules to complete query_sum/1' but this code doesn't address that requirement at all. The code needs complete regeneration to match the stated requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```
