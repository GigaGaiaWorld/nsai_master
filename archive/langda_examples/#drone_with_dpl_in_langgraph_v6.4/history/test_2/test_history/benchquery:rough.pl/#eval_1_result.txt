    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the required functionality. It defines a 'density' predicate that calculates population density by dividing population by area. The 'query_pop' predicate then finds all pairs of distinct countries where the absolute difference in their densities is not larger than 5% of the first country's density. The code is syntactically correct and logically sound for the given requirements. The test result shows it successfully finds country pairs with approximately equal population density.",
