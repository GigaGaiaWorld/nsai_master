  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, the 'implies' predicate is incorrectly split into two separate clauses, which changes its logical meaning from the original. Second, there are formatting errors with escaped characters like '\\n\\t' in the 'opposite' predicate. These issues make the generated code invalid and cause a parsing error during execution. The generated code does not maintain consistency with the original code's functionality."
