  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there are formatting issues, particularly with the line breaks and indentation in the 'overrun_exception' rule, which causes a parsing error ('Expected binary operator'). The content of the rules and the probabilistic model remain the same as the original. The error prevents the generated code from running successfully, unlike the original code which produces valid results."
