  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct. It contains a duplicated and malformed clause for 'attempted_flap_position' which breaks the logic. The original code checks if the previous position was not the goal using '\\+ goal(Old)', while the generated code incorrectly uses '\\+ goal_reached(Prev)'. This change in logic causes the system to never reach the goal and never trigger overrun exceptions, as shown by the all-zero results."
