  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it redefines 'implies/2', 'opposite/1', 'expand/2', 'includes/2', 'extend/3', and 'refute/1' as separate predicates instead of integrating them into the 'prove/1' meta-interpreter as in the original code. This structural change causes the code to fail during execution, resulting in a timeout error. The original code successfully integrates these operations within the 'prove/1' predicate, ensuring correct execution and results. The generated code's approach is syntactically valid but logically inconsistent with the original design, leading to execution failure."
