  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate where the case for 'draw' incorrectly passes 'S1' directly instead of computing 'S is S1'. Despite this, the running results are consistent with the original code, producing the same output for the given query."
