  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. The main difference is in the query_pop predicate, where the generated code uses C1 @< C2 and checks both 20*D1 < 21*D2 and 20*D2 < 21*D1, while the original code only checks D1 > D2, T1 is 20*D1, T2 is 21*D2, and T1 < T2. This change ensures that the countries are ordered and the density comparison is symmetric, which is an improvement. The running results are consistent, showing the same pairs of countries with similar population densities."
