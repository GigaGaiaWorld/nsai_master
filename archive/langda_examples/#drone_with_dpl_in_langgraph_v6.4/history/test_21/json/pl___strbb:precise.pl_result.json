  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has a critical difference in the 'bb' predicate. The original code uses 'II is I+1' and then 'pick(II,b)', while the generated code directly uses 'pick(I+1,b)'. This change affects the logic and results in a different probability calculation. The generated code is valid in form but produces an inconsistent result compared to the original code."
