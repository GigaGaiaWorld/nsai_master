As a result, the generated code fails to produce correct results for these operations, as shown by the 0.0000 probabilities in the run result. The only operation that works correctly is 'push', which was copied from the original code. The generated code also lacks the 'insertion_sort' predicate, which is necessary for the 'sort' operation to work."
