  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with a few minor issues. The main difference is the use of 'snail' instead of 'snails' in the generated code, which is a typographical error. Additionally, the generated code has duplicate definitions of 'houses', 'right_of', 'next_to', and 'my_member' predicates, which are redundant but do not affect functionality. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same solution to the zebra puzzle."
