  "final_report": "The generated code has significant differences from the original code. The first rule of 'carrying' is simplified and misses critical conditions 'at(robot,Pos,T)' and 'at(key,Pos,T)'. The second rule of 'carrying' incorrectly replaces the complex conditions with just 'retains_key(T)'. These changes alter the logic and probabilities, leading to different results. The 'at' rules are modified but maintain similar functionality. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results due to the logical changes."
