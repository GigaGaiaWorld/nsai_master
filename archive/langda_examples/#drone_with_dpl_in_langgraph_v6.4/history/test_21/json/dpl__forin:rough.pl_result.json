  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement insertion sort in Prolog with identical logic. The only differences are in variable naming (e.g., 'insert_element' vs 'insert') and minor formatting, which do not affect the behavior. The generated code produces the same correct sorting result as the original code."
