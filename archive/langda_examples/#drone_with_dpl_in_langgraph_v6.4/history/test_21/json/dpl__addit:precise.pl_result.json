  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The code is logically consistent with the original and correctly implements the extended functionality. The result shows the correct sum of 79 and 312, which is 391, demonstrating that the generated code works as expected."
