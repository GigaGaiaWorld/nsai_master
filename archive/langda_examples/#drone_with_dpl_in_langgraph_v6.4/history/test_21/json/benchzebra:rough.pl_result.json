  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It successfully replicates the logic of the original zebra puzzle solution, including all constraints and member checks. The only differences are in the formatting and the order of predicate definitions, which do not affect the program's behavior. Both codes produce identical results, solving the puzzle with the same house arrangement."
