  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic and produces the same results as the original code. The main difference is in the 'open_door' predicate, where the generated code simplifies the conditions for opening a door by directly checking that the door is not the selected one and not the prize door. This simplification maintains the correct behavior while making the code more concise. Both codes correctly show a 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice and a 2/3 chance by switching."
