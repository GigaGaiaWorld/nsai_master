  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly calculates population density and finds countries with approximately equal population density. However, the generated code uses a different method for determining 'approximately equal' (within 5% ratio) compared to the original code (which uses a fixed multiplier of 20 and 21). This change in methodology leads to slightly different results. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, but the results are not entirely consistent with the original due to the different comparison method."
