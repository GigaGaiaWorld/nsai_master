First, there is a syntax error in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate where the ternary operator is not properly formatted for Problog syntax. Second, the predicate is duplicated with different implementations, which causes confusion. The generated code does not maintain consistency with the original code's logic and structure, leading to a parsing error during execution."
