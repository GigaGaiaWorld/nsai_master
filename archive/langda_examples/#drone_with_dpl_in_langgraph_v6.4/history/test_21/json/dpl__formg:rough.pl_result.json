  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'split' function, where the generated code uses a more concise pattern matching approach compared to the original code's use of 'length' and 'append'. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
