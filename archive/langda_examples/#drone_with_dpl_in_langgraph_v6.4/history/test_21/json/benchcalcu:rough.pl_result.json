  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It correctly implements the cryptarithmetic puzzle solver for AB + BCD = CDE. The main differences are in formatting (extra spaces and line breaks) and a redundant duplicate query at the end, which doesn't affect functionality. The logic for digit constraints, sum calculations, and uniqueness checks remains intact. The generated code produces identical results to the original code."
