The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips, while the generated code attempts to use a non-ground probabilistic clause, which is not allowed in Problog. This results in a runtime error. The generated code also incorrectly handles the coin flip logic by introducing variables C=1 and C=0, which are not properly integrated into the probabilistic model."
