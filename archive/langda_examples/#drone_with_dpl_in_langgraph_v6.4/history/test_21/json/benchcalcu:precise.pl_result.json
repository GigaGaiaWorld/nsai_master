  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the cryptarithmetic puzzle. Both codes correctly implement the constraints for digit selection, carry propagation, and uniqueness of digits. The generated code has minor formatting differences (spacing and line breaks) but maintains the same logical structure and constraints. The all_different check is correctly placed before the sumdigit calls in the generated code, which is a valid optimization."
