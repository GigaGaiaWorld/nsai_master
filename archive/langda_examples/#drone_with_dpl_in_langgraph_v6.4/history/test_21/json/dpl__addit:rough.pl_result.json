  "final_report": "The generated code extends the functionality of the original code by introducing a 'number' predicate that can convert lists of images into multi-digit numbers and then perform addition. This is a valid extension and demonstrates consistency with the original code's approach to handling digit representations. The generated code correctly implements the new functionality and produces the expected result for multi-digit addition."
