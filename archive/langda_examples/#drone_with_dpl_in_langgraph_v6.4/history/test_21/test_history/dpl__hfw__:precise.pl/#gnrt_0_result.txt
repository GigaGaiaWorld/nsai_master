Here are the completed code snippets for the parse/2 predicates:

```problog
{"HASH": "2D3597DC","Code": "parse([N1,+|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 + R2)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "2D3597DC","Code": "parse([N1,-|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 - R2)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "2D3597DC","Code": "parse([N1,*|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 * R2)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "2D3597DC","Code": "parse([N1,/|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 / R2)."}
```

These predicates handle the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in the parse/2 function, each following the pattern of taking a number followed by an operator and recursively parsing the rest of the list. The almost_equal/2 predicate ensures proper floating-point comparison and handling.
