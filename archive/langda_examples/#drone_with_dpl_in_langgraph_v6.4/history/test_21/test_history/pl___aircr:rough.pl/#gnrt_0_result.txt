Based on the requirements, I'll generate the code for calculating the attempted flap position based on previous position, actuator used, target position, and wind effect. Here's the JSON-formatted Problog code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A5C06F43","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),\n \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n use_actuator(Time,Actuator),\n actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),\n goal(Target),\n wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),\n Pos is PrevPos + (Target > PrevPos ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect."}
```

This code completes the attempted_flap_position predicate by:
1. Getting the previous position
2. Checking if goal wasn't already reached
3. Getting the actuator being used and its strength
4. Getting the target position (goal)
5. Getting the wind effect for current time
6. Calculating new position based on direction to target (using actuator strength) plus wind effect

The ternary operator (?) is used to determine movement direction (left or right) based on whether target is greater than current position.
