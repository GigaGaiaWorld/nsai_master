System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>
detect_number(image_0, 0).
detect_number(image_1, 1).
detect_number(image_2, 2).
detect_number(image_3, 3).
detect_number(image_4, 4).
detect_number(image_5, 5).
detect_number(image_6, 6).
detect_number(image_7, 7).
detect_number(image_8, 8).
detect_number(image_9, 9).
detect_operator(image_plus, +).
detect_operator(image_minus, -).
detect_operator(image_multiply, *).
detect_operator(image_divide, /).
detect_all([N], [N2]) :- 
 detect_number(N, N2).
detect_all([N,O|T], [N2,O2|T2]) :- 
 detect_number(N, N2), 
 detect_operator(O, O2), 
 detect_all(T, T2).
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
 ground(Y), 
 abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
 var(Y), 
 Y is float(X).
expression(Images, Result) :- 
 detect_all(Images, Symbols), 
 parse(Symbols, Result).
parse([N], R) :- 
 almost_equal(N, R).
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: FB41E2F7 </HASH>
<Requirements>Define parse/2, it get a number followed with one of four operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) in the form of a list, each rule is written under a separate parse/2 predicate.(consider almost equal) </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
