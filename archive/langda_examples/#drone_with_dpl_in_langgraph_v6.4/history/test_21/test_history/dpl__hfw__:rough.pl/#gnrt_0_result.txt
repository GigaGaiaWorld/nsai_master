Here are the completed code snippets for the parse/2 predicates as requested:

```problog
{"HASH": "FB41E2F7","Code": "parse([N, '+', M | T], R) :- almost_equal(N + M, X), parse([X | T], R)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "FB41E2F7","Code": "parse([N, '-', M | T], R) :- almost_equal(N - M, X), parse([X | T], R)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "FB41E2F7","Code": "parse([N, '*', M | T], R) :- almost_equal(N * M, X), parse([X | T], R)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "FB41E2F7","Code": "parse([N, '/', M | T], R) :- almost_equal(N / M, X), parse([X | T], R)."}
```

These predicates handle the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in a left-associative manner, using the almost_equal/2 predicate to handle floating-point comparisons properly. Each operation is processed by computing the result of the current operation and then recursively parsing the remaining list with this intermediate result.
