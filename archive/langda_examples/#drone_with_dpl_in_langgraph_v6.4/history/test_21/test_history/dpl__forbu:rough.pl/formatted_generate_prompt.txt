System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
