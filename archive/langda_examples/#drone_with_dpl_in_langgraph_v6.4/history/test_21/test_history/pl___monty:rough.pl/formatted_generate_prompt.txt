System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>
% Based on Monty Hall problem on https://github.com/friguzzi/cplint
1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).
select_door(1).
member(X,[X|T]).
member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 245014E2 </HASH>
<Requirements>Define open_door/1 Predicate to solve the monty Hall problem, you can use multiple open_door/1 predicates </Requirements></Langda>
.
win_keep :-
 select_door(A),
 prize(A).
win_switch :-
 member(A, [1,2,3]),
 \+ select_door(A),
 prize(A),
 \+ open_door(A).
query(prize(_)).
query(select_door(_)).
query(win_keep).
query(win_switch).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
