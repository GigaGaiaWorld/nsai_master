System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>{'6931D64E': {'HASH': '6931D64E', 'Report': "The code defines a custom stack operation 'sort' that sorts the top 3 elements of a stack in ascending order. The implementation uses two predicates: 'stack_op' and 'get_top_n'. The 'get_top_n' predicate correctly extracts the top N elements from the stack and separates them from the rest. The 'stack_op' predicate then sorts these top 3 elements and appends them back to the rest of the stack. However, the error message indicates a priority clash in the Problog parser, likely due to the use of the '@=<' operator in the 'sort' predicate. This suggests that the syntax for sorting may need adjustment to comply with Problog's operator precedence rules.", 'Need_regenerate': 'true'}}</Report>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
