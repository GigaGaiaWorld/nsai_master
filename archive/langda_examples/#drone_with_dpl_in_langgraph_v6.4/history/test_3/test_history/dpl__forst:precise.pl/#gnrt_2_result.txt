Based on the report, I'll regenerate the code for the first block where there was a priority clash with the '@=<' operator in the sort predicate. Here's the fixed version:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "6931D64E",
    "Code": "stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-
    get_top_n(Stack, 3, Top3, Rest),
    sort(Top3, SortedTop3),
    append(SortedTop3, Rest, SortedStack).

get_top_n(Stack, N, Elements, Rest) :-
    length(Elements, N),
    append(Elements, Rest, Stack)."
}
```

The main changes made:
1. Removed the problematic '@=<' operator which was causing the priority clash
2. Simplified the sort predicate to use the standard sort/2 which sorts in ascending order by default
3. Kept the same functionality of sorting the top 3 elements of the stack
4. Maintained the same structure of getting top N elements and recombining them with the rest of the stack

The regenerated code maintains all the required functionality while avoiding the parser error mentioned in the report.
