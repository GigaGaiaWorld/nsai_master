System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>
person(a).
person(b).
0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).
0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).
0.1::riskyTravel(X) :- person(X).
0.1::susceptible(X) :- person(X).
<Langda> Information of 1st Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: E09B4F54 </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: inf/1 predicate logic summary Initial infection: Each person has a 0.1 probability of being infected at the beginning Contact transmission: If X has contact with infected person Y, then If X is not susceptible, he will be infected with a probability of 0.6 If X is susceptible, he will be infected with a probability of 0.8 Travel risk: Each person has an additional probability of 0.2 of infection due to high-risk travel </LLM></Langda>
.
query(inf(_)).
</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
