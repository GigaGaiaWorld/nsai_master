    "Report": "The code contains a typographical error in the predicate name. The error message indicates that 'susceptble/1' is unknown, which is due to the misspelling in the rule '0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+ susceptble(X).' and '0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptble(X).'. The correct predicate name is 'susceptible/1' as defined earlier in the code. Additionally, the logic of the rules is correctly summarized in the requirements, but the implementation has this critical spelling mistake that prevents it from running.",
