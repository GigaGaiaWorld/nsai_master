System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n % Problog Inference Resultï¼š\ninf(a) = 0.2416\ninf(b) = 0.2416</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>person(a).\nperson(b).\n\n0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).\n\n0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).\n\n0.1::susceptible(X) :- person(X).\n\n0.1::riskyTravel(X) :- person(X).\n\n% Initial infection\ninf(X) :- initialInf(X).\n\n% Contact transmission\n0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+ susceptible(X).\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n\n% Travel risk\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X).\n\nquery(inf(_)).</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: E09B4F54 </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: inf/1 predicate logic summary Initial infection: Each person has a 0.1 probability of being infected at the beginning Contact transmission: If X has contact with infected person Y, then If X is not susceptible, he will be infected with a probability of 0.6 If X is susceptible, he will be infected with a probability of 0.8 Travel risk: Each person has an additional probability of 0.2 of infection due to high-risk travel </LLM></Langda>']

Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
