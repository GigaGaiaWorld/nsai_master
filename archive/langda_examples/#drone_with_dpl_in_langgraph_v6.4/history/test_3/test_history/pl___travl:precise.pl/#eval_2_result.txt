The rules for initial infection, contact transmission (with different probabilities for susceptible and non-susceptible individuals), and travel risk are all correctly implemented. The query(inf(_)) at the end is also correctly placed to query the infection probabilities. The test results show reasonable probability outputs (0.2416 for both a and b) given the defined rules.",
