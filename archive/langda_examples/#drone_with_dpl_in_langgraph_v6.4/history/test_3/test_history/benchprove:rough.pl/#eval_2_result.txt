    "Report": "The code block implements extended logic processing for prove/1 as required, containing all specified predicates: implies/2, opposite/1, expand/2, includes/2, extend/2, and refute/1. The implementation appears syntactically correct for Prolog/DeepProblog. However, the error message suggests there might be an issue with clause resolution during execution, possibly due to missing base cases or incorrect usage elsewhere in the program. The code itself meets the specified requirements but may need integration adjustments.",
