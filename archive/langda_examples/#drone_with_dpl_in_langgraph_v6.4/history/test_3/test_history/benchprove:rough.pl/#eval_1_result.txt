    "Report": "The code contains syntax errors due to unmatched parentheses in the 'includes/2' and 'extend/2' rules. The error message indicates an unmatched character ')' at position 30:30. The rules themselves are logically correct and cover all required functionalities (implies/2, opposite/1, expand/2, includes/2, extend/2, refute/1), but the syntax needs to be fixed by removing the extra closing parentheses in the rule heads for 'includes' and 'extend'.",
