Here is the evaluation report for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
    "HASH": "B6FD3E20",
    "Report": "The code correctly specifies that D and E must be different digits, which is valid for the lowest digits of SEND and MORE. The constraint D \\= E ensures they are distinct.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "AFCFFD3D",
    "Report": "The code correctly sets up a sumdigit predicate for the unit digit addition (D + E) with carry C1. This is valid for the SEND+MORE=MONEY puzzle.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "BA7F9BE8",
    "Report": "The code correctly assigns a value to N and ensures it is different from Y, E, D using all_different. This maintains the puzzle's uniqueness constraints.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "3E567069",
    "Report": "The code correctly assigns a value to R and ensures it is different from N, Y, E, D. This follows the puzzle's rules for unique digit assignments.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "0BCA612F",
    "Report": "The sumdigit predicate correctly calculates N + R + C1 = E with carry C2 for the tens digit. This is valid for the puzzle's arithmetic constraints.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "710BBD98",
    "Report": "The code correctly assigns a value to O and ensures it is different from R, N, Y, E, D. This maintains the uniqueness requirement of the puzzle.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "58F57C1C",
    "Report": "The sumdigit predicate correctly calculates E + O + C2 = N with carry C3 for the hundreds digit. This follows the puzzle's arithmetic rules.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "70805326",
    "Report": "The code correctly assigns S as a leftdigit (non-zero) and ensures uniqueness among S, O, R, N, Y, E, D. This satisfies the puzzle's constraints for the thousands digit.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "72F32859",
    "Report": "The code correctly assigns M as a leftdigit (non-zero) and ensures uniqueness among all letters. This is valid for the highest digits of MORE and MONEY.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "4623869C",
    "Report": "The sumdigit predicate correctly calculates S + M + C3 = O with the carry result limited to M. This enforces the final constraint that the sum's highest digit is M.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
