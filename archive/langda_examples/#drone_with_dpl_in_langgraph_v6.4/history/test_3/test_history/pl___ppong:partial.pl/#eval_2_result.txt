    "Report": "The code correctly implements the requirement of calculating team strength as the minimum of all members' strengths. The first rule handles the base case for a single player team, while the second rule recursively calculates the minimum strength for a team with multiple players. The use of 'min(S1,S2)' ensures the minimum strength is selected. The code is syntactically correct for Prolog/ProbLog and matches the stated requirements.",
