Here's the regenerated code for the specified block:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "766936E0",
    "Code": "team_strength([P],G,S) :- strength(P,G,S).\nteam_strength([P,P2|L],G,S) :- strength(P,G,S1), team_strength([P2|L],G,S2), S is min(S1,S2)."
}
```

The changes made:
1. Fixed the syntax for the min operation by using `is min()` instead of the `min/3` predicate
2. Added the base case for single team member
3. Maintained the same logic of taking the minimum strength of all team members
4. The code now properly implements the requirement that team strength is the minimum of all members' strengths
