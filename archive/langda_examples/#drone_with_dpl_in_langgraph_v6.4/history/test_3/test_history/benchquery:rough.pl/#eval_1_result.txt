    "Report": "The code is valid and correctly implements the requirements. It defines population and area facts for various countries, calculates population density using the 'density' predicate, and implements the 'query_pop' predicate to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The query at the end ensures the results are computed. The test results show correct pairs of countries with similar population densities.",
