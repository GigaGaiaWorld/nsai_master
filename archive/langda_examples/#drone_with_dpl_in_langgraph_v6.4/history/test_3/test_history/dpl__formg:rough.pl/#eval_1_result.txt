    "Report": "The provided Prolog code correctly implements a merge sort algorithm. The code includes all necessary components: base cases for empty and single-element lists, recursive splitting and merging of lists, and helper predicates for splitting and merging. The example query demonstrates that the code works as expected, producing the correct sorted output for the input [3,1,2,5,7,12]. The implementation is interpretable and follows standard Prolog conventions for recursive list processing.",
