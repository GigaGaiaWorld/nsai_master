For the first code block, I'll regenerate it according to the report which suggests enhancing the basic functionality with time constraints and previous position checks. Here's the improved version:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "779B4ADF",
    "Code": "flap_position(Time,Pos), goal(Pos), Time > 0, Prev is Time-1, flap_position(Prev,PrevPos), \+ goal(PrevPos)."
}
```

This enhanced version:
1. Still checks if current position matches goal (flap_position(Time,Pos), goal(Pos))
2. Adds time constraint (Time > 0)
3. Checks previous position (Prev is Time-1, flap_position(Prev,PrevPos))
4. Ensures previous position wasn't already the goal (\+ goal(PrevPos))

This makes the rule more complete by ensuring we properly track the progression towards the goal over time, rather than just checking if we're at the goal at any point.

Note: The second code block wasn't provided with its requirements, so I can't regenerate it. The JSON structure shows there should be a second block, but the information is missing in the input.
