Here are the reports for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
    "HASH": "D38F9F68",
    "Report": "The first code block defines a predicate game/4 that correctly distributes cards between player and opponent (first two cards to player, last two to opponent) and calculates their best hands. The logic appears sound for the requirements specified. The error in the test results doesn't seem related to this particular code block.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "EF02D81B",
    "Report": "The second code block has potential issues. It calls game/4 but then uses best_hand_rank with only 3 cards (two player cards + house) which contradicts the 4-card distribution in game/4. Also, it references card(R1) etc. but these variables aren't bound in the clause. The error message about operator priority might be coming from this mismatch.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "C53A4763",
    "Report": "The third code block appears logically correct for randomly selecting a house card and calling game/3. However, its correctness depends on game/3 being properly defined (which from the second block appears problematic). The structure itself follows the requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```
