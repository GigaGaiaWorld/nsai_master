Here's the regenerated code for the specified block:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "EF02D81B",
    "Code": "game(Cards,House,Outcome) :-
    cards(Cards,own,House,OwnCards),
    cards(Cards,opponent,House,OpponentCards),
    best_hand_rank(OwnCards,Rank1),
    best_hand_rank(OpponentCards,Rank2),
    outcome(Rank1,Rank2,Outcome)."
}
```

The changes made address the issues identified in the report:
1. Now properly uses the cards/4 predicate to get both player's cards (own and opponent)
2. Uses the full card sets including the house card for both players
3. Properly binds the card variables through the cards/4 predicate calls
4. Maintains the same functionality of determining the outcome by comparing hand ranks
5. Matches the requirement to return only the Outcome âˆˆ {win, loss, draw}
