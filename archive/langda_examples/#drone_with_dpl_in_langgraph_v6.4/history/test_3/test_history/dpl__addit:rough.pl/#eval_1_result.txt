    "Report": "The code defines a 'digit' predicate that maps image IDs to their corresponding digits (0-9). The 'number' predicate is intended to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer value. However, the implementation contains an error: it uses an undefined 'length/1' function in the arithmetic expression '10 ^ length(T)'. Problog doesn't have a built-in 'length' function for lists in arithmetic expressions. The code needs to be modified to either calculate the length differently or restructure the number conversion logic.",
