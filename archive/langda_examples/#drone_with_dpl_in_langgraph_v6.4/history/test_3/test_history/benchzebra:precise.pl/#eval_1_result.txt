    "Report": "The provided code is a valid Prolog implementation of the classic Zebra puzzle. The code correctly defines all the necessary rules and constraints for solving the puzzle, including house arrangements, attribute relationships, and neighbor conditions. The predicates like my_member, right_of, and next_to are correctly implemented to support the puzzle logic. The query(zebra(Houses)) at the end is also correctly set up to find the solution. The error message shown in the test result appears to be unrelated to this specific code block and might be coming from a different part of the system or a parsing issue in the surrounding framework.",
