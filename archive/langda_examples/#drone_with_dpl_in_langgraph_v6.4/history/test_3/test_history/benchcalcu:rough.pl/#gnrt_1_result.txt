Based on the analysis report, I'll regenerate the first code block for the cryptarithmetic puzzle CROSS + ROADS = DANGER. The main issue was with operator priority in the Problog engine, so I'll adjust the syntax while maintaining the same mathematical logic.

```problog
{
    "HASH": "11FB8FD3",
    "Code": "% Find the unique answer to:\n%   CROSS\n% + ROADS\n% -------\n% DANGER\nquery_sum([C,R,O,S,A,D,N,G,E]) :-\n    leftdigit(C),\n    leftdigit(R),\n    leftdigit(D),\n    digit(O),\n    digit(S),\n    digit(A),\n    digit(N),\n    digit(G),\n    digit(E),\n    all_different([C,R,O,S,A,D,N,G,E]),\n    S1 is (S + S),\n    R1 is S1 div 10,\n    S2 is S1 mod 10,\n    O1 is (O + A + R1),\n    R2 is O1 div 10,\n    O2 is O1 mod 10,\n    S3 is (S + D + R2),\n    R3 is S3 div 10,\n    S4 is S3 mod 10,\n    R4 is (R + O + R3),\n    R5 is R4 div 10,\n    R6 is R4 mod 10,\n    C1 is (C + R + R5),\n    D is C1 mod 10,\n    D1 is C1 div 10,\n    D =:= N,\n    D1 =:= 0."
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Replaced `//` with `div` for integer division which is more standard in Prolog/Problog
2. Added parentheses around arithmetic expressions to ensure proper operator precedence
3. Maintained all the original constraints and logic for solving the puzzle
4. Kept the same variable names and structure for clarity

The regenerated code should now be properly parsed by the Problog engine while solving the cryptarithmetic puzzle correctly.
