Here are the reports for the two code blocks:

```report
{
    "HASH": "11FB8FD3",
    "Report": "The code attempts to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (CROSS + ROADS = DANGER) with proper constraints for digit uniqueness and left-digit rules. However, the error message indicates a parsing issue with operator priority in the Problog engine. The mathematical logic appears correct for solving the puzzle, but the syntax may need adjustment for Problog compatibility. The code implements all required constraints for the puzzle including: left-digit checks, digit uniqueness, and proper carry-over arithmetic.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "9D7ABC12",
    "Report": "This code correctly implements the SEND + MORE = MONEY cryptarithmetic puzzle. It properly handles: left-digit constraints for S and M, digit uniqueness, and carry-over arithmetic operations. The logic correctly models the addition with proper carry propagation through each digit position. All variables are properly constrained and the arithmetic operations follow the puzzle requirements. The code appears syntactically correct and should work as intended.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
