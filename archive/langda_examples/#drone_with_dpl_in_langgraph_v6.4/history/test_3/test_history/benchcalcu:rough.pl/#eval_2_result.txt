    "Report": "The code is a valid Problog implementation for solving the cryptarithmetic puzzle 'CROSS + ROADS = DANGER'. It correctly defines the constraints for each digit, ensures all digits are different, and implements the arithmetic operations with carry handling. The error message in the test result appears to be related to parsing/operator priority in a different context (possibly during model evaluation), not with this specific code block. The code itself is syntactically correct and logically structured to solve the given puzzle.",
