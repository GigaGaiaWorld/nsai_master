Based on the analysis report, I'll regenerate the code for the first block where there was an operator priority clash. Here's the corrected version:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "0F506A43",
    "Code": "zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, spanish, dog, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(green, _, _, coffee, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(white, _, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),
    Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _, _],
    Houses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)|_],
    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,chesterfields), house(_,_,fox,_,_), Houses),
    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,kools), house(_,_,horse,_,_), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),
    next_to(house(_,norwegian,_,_,_), house(blue,_,_,_,_), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses).

houses([
    house(_, _, _, _, _),
    house(_, _, _, _, _),
    house(_, _, _, _, _),
    house(_, _, _, _, _),
    house(_, _, _, _, _)
]).

right_of(A, B, [B, A | _]).
right_of(A, B, [_ | Y]) :- right_of(A, B, Y).
next_to(A, B, [A, B | _]).
next_to(A, B, [B, A | _]).
next_to(A, B, [_ | Y]) :- next_to(A, B, Y).
my_member(X, [X|_]).
my_member(X, [_|Y]) :- my_member(X, Y).

query(zebra(Houses))."
}
```

The main changes made:
1. Ensured proper comma separation between constraints in the zebra predicate
2. Maintained consistent formatting for better readability
3. Kept all the original logical constraints while fixing the syntax issues
4. Preserved all helper predicates (houses, right_of, next_to, my_member) exactly as they were since they were correct

The code now should properly parse and solve the classic Zebra puzzle without operator priority issues.
