System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n Error evaluating Problog model:\n    rf = self.fold(\n         ^^^^^^^^^^\n  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1101, in fold\n    raise ParseError(\nproblog.parser.ParseError: Operator priority clash at 33:35.</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n    Time > 0,\n    Prev is Time-1,\n    flap_position(Prev,Old),\n    goal(GP),\n    Old \\= GP,\n    use_actuator(Time,A),\n    actuator_strength(A,AS),\n    Sign is sign(GP-Old),\n    AE is Sign * AS,\n    wind_effect(Time,WE),\n    Pos is Old + AE - Sign * AS.</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: 5BCD04E8 </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: At time Time, the aircraft flaps attempt to move to the Pos position:  1. Get the actual flap position Old of the previous step  2. If Old is already the target position, no more attempts to move  3. Randomly select an actuator A (a or b)  4. Find the thrust/strength AS of this actuator (a:2, b:1)  5. Get the target position GP (GP = 4 in this example)  6. Calculate the ideal movement AE:  % sign(GP-Old) gives â€“1/0/+1 depending on whether the target is on the left or right,  % and then multiply by AS to get the amplitude of the left or right movement  7. Get a random wind disturbance WE (possibly positive or negative) according to the wind model  8. Subtract the ideal movement AE The wind disturbance WE is added to Old to get the trial position Pos. </LLM></Langda>']

Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
