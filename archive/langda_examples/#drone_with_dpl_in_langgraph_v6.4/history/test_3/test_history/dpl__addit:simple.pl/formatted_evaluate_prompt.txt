System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: <code_list>
I need you to generate a report for the features in my DeepProblog code. Below I will give the code with <langda> blocks, please evaluate if the code in <langda> blocks are valid, and generate the report as required.

['<Result> Here are the testing result of code:\n % Problog Inference Resultï¼š\naddition(img_5,img_6,X2) = 1.0000\naddition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000</Result>', '<Langda> The 1st Code Block That You Should Analyse:\n<Current_Code>digit(img_1,1).\ndigit(img_2,2).\ndigit(img_3,3).\ndigit(img_4,4).\ndigit(img_5,5).\ndigit(img_6,6).\ndigit(img_7,7).\ndigit(img_8,8).\ndigit(img_9,9).\ndigit(img_0,0).\naddition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A+B.\nquery(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).</Current_Code>\n<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6E46AD63 </HASH>\n<LLM> Requirements of Rules: addition logic, input as img_1 to img_0 </LLM></Langda>']

Please evaluate the correctness of the code listing and generate a report in JSON form, for each code block using a single report block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here",
    "Need_regenerate": "[true | false]" // true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here",
    "Need_regenerate": [True|False] // Set to true if the code needs to be regenerated; otherwise, false.
}
```

# This is really important! Please make sure the code fits completely inside the placeholder.
