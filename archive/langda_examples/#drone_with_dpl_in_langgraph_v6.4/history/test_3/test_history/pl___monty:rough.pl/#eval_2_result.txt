    "Report": "The code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem but contains several issues. The main error shown in the test results indicates 'No clauses found' for an unspecified predicate, suggesting there might be missing or incorrectly defined predicates. The open_door/1 predicate logic is complex and may not correctly implement the required behavior. The probability handling (0.5::open_door_rand(_)) seems misplaced and could interfere with the intended random selection. The code needs restructuring to properly handle both scenarios (random selection between two empty doors vs deterministic selection of the only empty door).",
