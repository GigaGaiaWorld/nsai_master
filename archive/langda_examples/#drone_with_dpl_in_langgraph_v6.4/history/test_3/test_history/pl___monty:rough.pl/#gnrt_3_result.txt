Here's the regenerated code for the first block based on the analysis report:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "592D75CA",
    "Code": "% Monty Hall problem with clear probabilistic rules\n1/3::prize(1); 1/3::prize(2); 1/3::prize(3).\nselect_door(1).\n\n% Helper predicate\nmember(X,[X|_]).\nmember(X,[_|T]) :- member(X,T).\n\n% Deterministic door opening when only one empty door remains\nopen_door(D) :-\n    select_door(S),\n    prize(P),\n    member(D,[1,2,3]),\n    D \\= S,\n    D \\= P,\n    % Ensure this is the only remaining empty door\n    \+ (member(Other,[1,2,3]), Other \\= S, Other \\= P, Other \\= D).\n\n% Probabilistic door opening when two empty doors remain\n0.5::open_door(D1); 0.5::open_door(D2) :-\n    select_door(S),\n    prize(P),\n    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), D \\= S, D \\= P), [D1,D2]).\n\n% Queries\nquery(prize(_)).\nquery(select_door(_)).\nquery(win_keep).\nquery(win_switch)."
}
```

Key improvements made:
1. Removed the conflicting deterministic and probabilistic rules for open_door
2. Created clear separation between deterministic case (only one empty door) and probabilistic case (two empty doors)
3. Simplified the logic using findall to identify available doors
4. Maintained consistent probability handling (50/50 when two doors available)
5. Kept all necessary queries for the Monty Hall problem analysis

The code now properly implements both scenarios:
- When only one empty door remains (deterministic opening)
- When two empty doors remain (probabilistic 50/50 choice)
