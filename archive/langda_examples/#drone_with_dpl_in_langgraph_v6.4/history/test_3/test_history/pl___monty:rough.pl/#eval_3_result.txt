    "Report": "The code implements the Monty Hall problem with probabilistic rules for door opening. The main issues found are:\n1. The error message indicates an unknown clause for '/2' at line 18:21, suggesting a syntax or predicate definition problem.\n2. The probabilistic rules for open_door/1 are redundant with the deterministic rules above them.\n3. The member/2 predicate is defined but not properly utilized in the probabilistic rules.\n4. The code mixes deterministic and probabilistic approaches in a way that may cause conflicts.\n\nThe code needs restructuring to:\n1. Resolve the unknown clause error\n2. Choose either a purely probabilistic or deterministic approach\n3. Simplify the door opening logic\n4. Ensure consistent handling of all cases",
