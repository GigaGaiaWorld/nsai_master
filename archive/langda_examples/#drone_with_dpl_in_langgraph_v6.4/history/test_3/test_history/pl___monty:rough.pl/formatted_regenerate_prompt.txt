<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Define open_door/1 Predicate: Random Door Opening Rules Scenario: The remaining two doors are neither selected by the player nor have any prizes. Behavior: The host randomly opens one of the two "empty doors" with a 50% probability. Deterministic Door Opening Rules Scenario: The remaining two doors are neither selected by the player, one of which has a prize and the other does not. Behavior: The host must open the "empty door". </LLM></Langda>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
