    "Report": "The code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem with probabilistic rules for door opening. However, there are several issues:\n1. Syntax error in the conditional statements - the '->' operator has priority clash issues\n2. The predicates open_door_one/1 and open_door_two/1 are incorrectly defined (they should be probabilistic facts, not rules)\n3. The logic for selecting doors could be simplified\n4. The code doesn't properly handle the 50% probability case when two doors are available\n\nKey problems:\n- The parse error indicates operator priority issues in line 17\n- The probabilistic selection mechanism is not correctly implemented\n- The door selection logic is unnecessarily complex",
