    "Report": "The code defines the game rules of rock-paper-scissors correctly. It includes the three possible moves (rock, paper, scissor) and the win-lose relationships between them. The play_round/3 predicate correctly determines the result of a single round, and the play/3 predicate handles multiple rounds. The compute_score/2 predicate calculates the score from the results, and the determine_winner/3 predicate determines the overall winner based on the score. The query at the end tests the determine_winner/3 predicate with specific moves. The error message indicates an issue with the execution environment rather than the code itself, as the code logic is correct for the rock-paper-scissors game.",
