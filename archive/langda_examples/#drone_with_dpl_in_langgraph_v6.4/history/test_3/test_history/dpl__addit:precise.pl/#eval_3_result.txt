    "Report": "The provided code block defines two predicates: 'number/3' and 'multi_addition/3'. The 'number/3' predicate is intended to parse a list of images into a number by processing each image as a digit and accumulating the result. The 'multi_addition/3' predicate is intended to parse two lists of images into numbers and then add them together. However, the code does not include the 'digit/2' predicate, which is necessary for the 'number/3' predicate to function. Additionally, the error message suggests there is a parsing issue, likely due to operator priority. The code needs to be regenerated to include the missing 'digit/2' predicate and to resolve the operator priority clash.",
