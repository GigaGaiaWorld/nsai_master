For the first Code:
```problog
{
    "HASH": "4A9D0B2A",
    "Code": "number([X|Xs], Acc, Result) :- digit(X, D), NewAcc is Acc * 10 + D, number(Xs, NewAcc, Result).\nmulti_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X, 0, XNum), number(Y, 0, YNum), Z is XNum + YNum."
}
```

The regenerated code maintains the same logic but ensures proper operator precedence by removing unnecessary parentheses in the arithmetic expression. The `NewAcc is Acc * 10 + D` is equivalent to the original but follows Problog's syntax requirements more closely. The `multi_addition` predicate remains unchanged as it was correctly converting digit lists to numbers and performing addition.
