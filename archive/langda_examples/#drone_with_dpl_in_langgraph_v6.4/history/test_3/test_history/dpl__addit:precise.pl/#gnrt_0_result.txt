Here are the completed code blocks in JSON form:

For the first code:
```problog
{
    "HASH": "6579E7BA",
    "Code": "number([H|T], Acc, Result) :- digit(H, Nr), NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr, number(T, NewAcc, Result)."
}
```

For the second code:
```problog
{
    "HASH": "4A9D0B2A",
    "Code": "multi_addition(X, Y, Z) :- number(X, XNum), number(Y, YNum), Z is XNum + YNum."
}
```

The first code completes the number/3 predicate by:
1. Taking the head of the list and converting it to a digit using digit/2
2. Adding it to the "low bit" (right side) of the accumulated value by multiplying the accumulator by 10 and adding the new digit
3. Recursively processing the tail of the list with the new accumulator

The second code implements multi_addition by:
1. Converting both image lists to numbers using number/2
2. Adding the two resulting numbers together
3. Unifying the result with Z

The example query would correctly calculate 79 + 312 = 391.
