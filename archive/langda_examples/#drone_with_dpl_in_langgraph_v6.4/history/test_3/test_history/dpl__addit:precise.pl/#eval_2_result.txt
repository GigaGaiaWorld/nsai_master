    "Report": "The provided code block defines a predicate 'multi_addition' that takes three arguments X, Y, and Z. It uses the 'number' predicate to convert X and Y into numbers XNum and YNum respectively, then calculates Z as their sum. However, the code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the LLM section. The requirement is to parse an image list (e.g., [img_3,img_4]) into a number (e.g., 34), but the current code doesn't handle lists or image parsing. The error message suggests there's also a parsing priority issue in the Problog implementation. The code needs to be regenerated to properly handle image list parsing and addition.",
