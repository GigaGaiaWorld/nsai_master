    "Report": "The code implements an insertion sort algorithm in Prolog. The error message indicates a problem with the comparison operator '=</2' where it expects ground terms but receives a variable X1. This suggests the query is not properly instantiated or there's an issue with variable handling during execution. The logic of the insertion sort itself appears correct: 1) It properly handles the base case of an empty list, 2) It recursively sorts the tail list, and 3) It has proper rules for inserting elements in sorted order. The error appears to be more about execution context than fundamental logic issues.",
