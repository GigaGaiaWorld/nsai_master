    "Report": "The provided code implements a correct bubblesort algorithm in Prolog. The main predicates (bubblesort/3, bubble_pass/3, and append/3) are properly defined and should work as expected. However, the error message indicates that DeepProbLog is having trouble with the query format. The issue appears to be with how the query is being called in DeepProbLog, not with the Prolog implementation itself. The query format might need adjustment to be compatible with DeepProbLog's syntax requirements. The probabilistic fact (0.5::dummy) is correctly formatted for DeepProbLog.",
