System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Current_Code>% Interpretable bubblesort algorithm
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(L, L1, Changed),
    (Changed == true ->
        bubblesort(L1, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
        append(Acc, L1, Sorted)
    ).

% Single pass of bubble sort
bubble_pass([X,Y|T], [Y|Rest], true) :-
    X > Y,
    bubble_pass([X|T], Rest, _).
bubble_pass([X,Y|T], [X|Rest], Changed) :-
    X =< Y,
    bubble_pass([Y|T], Rest, Changed).
bubble_pass([X], [X], false).
bubble_pass([], [], false).

% Helper predicate
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L, [H|R]) :- append(T, L, R).

% Query example
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

<Report>{'47D659C8': {'HASH': '47D659C8', 'Report': "The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog with the following components:\n1. A main `bubblesort/3` predicate that handles the recursive sorting process\n2. A `bubble_pass/3` helper predicate that performs a single pass of the bubble sort\n3. An `append/3` helper predicate for list concatenation\n4. A query example and `forth_sort/2` wrapper\n\nIssues found:\n1. The query example uses `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` but the error suggests DeepProblog cannot find clauses for this predicate\n2. The error message indicates the system cannot find clauses for an empty functor '/2'\n\nCorrectness:\n- The sorting logic itself appears correct for standard Prolog\n- The issue appears to be with DeepProblog's handling of the code rather than the algorithm itself\n- The query format may need adjustment for DeepProblog compatibility", 'Need_regenerate': 'true'}}</Report>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
