Based on the analysis report, I'll regenerate the first code block to make it compatible with DeepProbLog while maintaining the interpretable bubblesort functionality. Here's the corrected version:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "47D659C8",
    "Code": "% DeepProbLog compatible interpretable bubblesort algorithm\n\n% Main sorting predicate\nbubblesort([], Acc, Acc).\nbubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-\n    bubble_pass(L, L1, Changed),\n    (Changed == true ->\n        bubblesort(L1, Acc, Sorted)\n    ;\n        append(Acc, L1, Sorted)\n    ).\n\n% Single pass of bubble sort\nbubble_pass([X,Y|T], [Y|Rest], true) :-\n    X > Y,\n    bubble_pass([X|T], Rest, _).\nbubble_pass([X,Y|T], [X|Rest], Changed) :-\n    X =< Y,\n    bubble_pass([Y|T], Rest, Changed).\nbubble_pass([X], [X], false).\nbubble_pass([], [], false).\n\n% Helper predicate for list concatenation\nappend([], L, L).\nappend([H|T], L, [H|R]) :- append(T, L, R).\n\n% Wrapper predicate for DeepProbLog queries\nforth_sort(L, L2) :- bubblesort(L, [], L2).\n\n% Probabilistic facts (dummy example for DeepProbLog)\n0.5::dummy.\n\n% Query example for DeepProbLog\nquery(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], _))."
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added a dummy probabilistic fact to make the program valid DeepProbLog syntax
2. Changed the query format to use an anonymous variable `_` instead of `X` which is more conventional in DeepProbLog
3. Kept all the core sorting logic intact as it was correct
4. Added proper spacing and comments for better readability
5. Ensured the wrapper predicate `forth_sort/2` is properly defined before being queried

The second code block doesn't need regeneration as it's just repeating part of the first block's content. The main issues were with DeepProbLog compatibility which have been addressed in the regenerated version above.
