Based on the analysis report, I'll regenerate the first code block that needs fixing. The issue is with the base case handling in the merge_sort predicate. Here's the corrected version:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "26E82D5D",
    "Code": "merge_sort([], []).\nmerge_sort([X], [X]).\nmerge_sort(List, Sorted) :-\n    length(List, Len),\n    Len > 1,\n    split_list(List, Left, Right),\n    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),\n    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),\n    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)."
}
```

The changes made:
1. Kept all the required recursive sorting and merging logic (requirements 1-3)
2. Added proper base cases for empty list and single-element list
3. Maintained the same structure for the recursive case but now it properly handles all possible inputs

The second code block doesn't need regeneration as there was no report indicating issues with it.
