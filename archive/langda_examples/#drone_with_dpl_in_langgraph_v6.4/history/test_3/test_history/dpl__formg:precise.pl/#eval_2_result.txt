    "Report": "The code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog correctly. It contains all the required rules: 1. Base cases for empty list and single-element list. 2. Recursive splitting of the list into left and right halves. 3. Recursive calls to merge_sort for both halves (SortedLeft and SortedRight). 4. Merging of the sorted halves into the final result (Sorted). The logic follows the standard merge sort algorithm structure.",
