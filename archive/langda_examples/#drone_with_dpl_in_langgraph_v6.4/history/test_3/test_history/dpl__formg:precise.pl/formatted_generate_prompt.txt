System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.

merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
 
<Langda> Information of 1st Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 95E704F2 </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Should contain following rules: 1.Get the length of the current list, Len, to determine whether to continue splitting. 2.Recursive boundary judgment: Only lists with a length greater than 1 need to be sorted, otherwise they are sorted by default. 3.Split the list into two parts, Left and Right, for subsequent recursive processing. </LLM></Langda>
,
 
<Langda> Information of 2nd Placeholder:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 26E82D5D </HASH>
<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Should contain following rules: 1.Recursively call merge sort on the left half, and the result is SortedLeft. 2.Recursively sort the right half, and the result is SortedRight. 3.Merge the two sorted sublists into the final sorted result Sorted. </LLM></Langda>
.
split_list(List, Left, Right) :-
 length(List, Len),
 Half is Len // 2,
 length(Left, Half),
 append(Left, Right, List).
merge([], List, List).
merge(List, [], List).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H1|Merged]) :-
 H1 =< H2,
 merge(T1, [H2|T2], Merged).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H2|Merged]) :-
 H1 > H2,
 merge([H1|T1], T2, Merged).
 
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
