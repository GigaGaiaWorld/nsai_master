Here are the evaluation reports for the provided code blocks in JSON format:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "95E704F2",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog. It satisfies all requirements: 1. Gets the length of the list using length/2. 2. Uses a conditional (->/2) for recursive boundary judgment (Len > 1). 3. Splits the list and recursively processes both halves before merging. The code is well-structured and handles the base case (Len <= 1) properly.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "26E82D5D",
    "Report": "The code implements merge sort but has a critical flaw - it lacks proper base case handling. The code will fail when Len <= 1 as there's no alternative clause. While it correctly implements the recursive sorting and merging of sublists (requirements 1-3), it doesn't meet the complete specification as it doesn't handle the base case properly. This matches the parse error seen in the test results.",
    "Need_regenerate": true
}
