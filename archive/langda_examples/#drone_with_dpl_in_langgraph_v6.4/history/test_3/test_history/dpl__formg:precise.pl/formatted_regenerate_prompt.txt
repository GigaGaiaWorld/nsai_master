System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>{'26E82D5D': {'HASH': '26E82D5D', 'Report': "The code implements merge sort but has a critical flaw - it lacks proper base case handling. The code will fail when Len <= 1 as there's no alternative clause. While it correctly implements the recursive sorting and merging of sublists (requirements 1-3), it doesn't meet the complete specification as it doesn't handle the base case properly.

<LLM> Requirements of Rules: Should contain following rules: 1.Recursively call merge sort on the left half, and the result is SortedLeft. 2.Recursively sort the right half, and the result is SortedRight. 3.Merge the two sorted sublists into the final sorted result Sorted. </LLM></Langda>

<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
