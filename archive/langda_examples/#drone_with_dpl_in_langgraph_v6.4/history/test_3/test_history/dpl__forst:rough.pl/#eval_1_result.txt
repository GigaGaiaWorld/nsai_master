    "Report": "The code implements a series of stack operations including push, pop, dup, swap, over, and rot. The implementation is correct and matches the expected results shown in the testing results. The additional sort operation is also implemented correctly with helper predicates get_top_n, insertion_sort, and insert. The queries at the end of the code correctly test the stack operations. The code is valid and does not need to be regenerated.",
