    "Report": "The provided Prolog code correctly implements an insertion sort algorithm. The code consists of three main parts: 1) A base case for the empty list, 2) A recursive case that sorts the tail and inserts the head in the correct position, and 3) Two cases for the insert predicate that handle insertion into an empty list and a non-empty list. The query example demonstrates proper usage of the insertion_sort/2 predicate. The code is interpretable as required and produces correct results as shown in the test output (insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],[1,2,3,5,7,12]) = 1.0000).",
