    "Report": "The code implements a recursive expression evaluator (parse/2) that can handle basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). The logic appears correct for parsing and evaluating expressions in list form. However, the error message indicates that the 'append/3' predicate is not found, which suggests either: 1) The Prolog environment being used doesn't support this built-in predicate, or 2) There's a missing import/declaration for lists. The core logic meets the requirements for arithmetic operations but fails due to environment/predicate availability issues.",
