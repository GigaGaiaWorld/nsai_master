Here is the evaluation report in JSON format for each code block:

```report
{
    "HASH": "99C92279",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the implication rule (P â‡’ Q) where the implication holds if either P is unprovable (\\+ prove(P)) or Q is provable (prove(Q)). The syntax and logic are valid for Prolog/DeepProblog.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "1405B337",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the opposite/negation rule where opposite(P) holds if P is unprovable (\\+ prove(P)). The syntax and logic are valid for Prolog/DeepProblog.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "C68F7B35",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the list extension operation where Extended is formed by adding Elem to the head of List. The syntax and logic are valid for Prolog/DeepProblog.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "0F69CE0F",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the expand/2 rule where Y is calculated as X*2. The syntax and logic are valid for Prolog/DeepProblog.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
