System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.

% - 3 whales are seen in three closeby locations a,b,c
% - the one on position a is an adult orca (with identifier 3)
% - the other two are an adult and calf sperm whale (with IDs 2 and 1)
% - there are six possibilities for gender of the adults and positions of the sperm whales
% information shared by all worlds:
species(1,sperm).
gender(1,calf).
species(2,sperm).
species(3,orca).
position(3,a).
% information differing per world
position(1,b) :- world(a).
position(2,c) :- world(a).
gender(2,cow) :- world(a).
gender(3,cow) :- world(a).
position(1,b) :- world(b).
position(2,c) :- world(b).
gender(2,cow) :- world(b).
gender(3,bull) :- world(b).
position(1,b) :- world(c).
position(2,c) :- world(c).
gender(2,bull) :- world(c).
gender(3,cow) :- world(c).
position(1,b) :- world(d).
position(2,c) :- world(d).
gender(2,bull) :- world(d).
gender(3,bull) :- world(d).
position(1,c) :- world(e).
position(2,b) :- world(e).
gender(2,cow) :- world(e).
gender(3,cow) :- world(e).
position(1,c) :- world(f).
position(2,b) :- world(f).
gender(2,bull) :- world(f).
gender(3,cow) :- world(f).

% query 1: does the orca attack the calf? (this happens if the calf is at position b)
attack :- position(1,b).
query(attack).
% query 2: same query, but under the constraint that sperm cows move in between their calf and an orca (uncomment evidence to run)
constraint1 :- not (gender(2,cow), not position(2,b)).
%evidence(constraint1).
% query 3: does the adult sperm abandon the calf? (and in which gender combinations does this happen)
abandon(S,O) :-

<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
