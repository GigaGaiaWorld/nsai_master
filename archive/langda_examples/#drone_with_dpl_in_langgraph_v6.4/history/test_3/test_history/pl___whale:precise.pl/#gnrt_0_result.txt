Based on the requirements, I'll generate the JSON form for the code block with the placeholder. Here's the complete solution:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "A90B08DE",
    "Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)."
}
```

This code implements the rule as specified in the requirements:
- It defines when the adult sperm whale (ID 2) abandons the calf based on:
  - The gender S of the adult sperm whale (gender(2,S))
  - The gender O of the orca (gender(3,O))
  - The position of the adult sperm whale being at c (position(2,c))
- The rule will be true when all these conditions are met, indicating abandonment
- The query(abandon(_,_)) at the end will then compute the probabilities of this abandonment scenario under different gender combinations
