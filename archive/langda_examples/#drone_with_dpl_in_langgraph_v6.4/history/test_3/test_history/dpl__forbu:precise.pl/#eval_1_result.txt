Here are the evaluation reports for the provided code blocks:

For the first Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "2971FD2F",
    "Report": "The code implements a recursive bubblesort predicate correctly. It follows the standard bubblesort algorithm by first calling bubble/3 to perform one pass of bubbling (which would move the largest element to its correct position), then recursively calling bubblesort on the remaining list. The sorted elements are accumulated in the third argument. The implementation matches the requirement of recursively processing L2 and building the sorted list by prepending X.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

For the second Code:
```report
{
    "HASH": "5CBF7C6A",
    "Report": "The swap predicate is correctly implemented with two clauses: one for when a swap is needed (X > Y) and one for when no swap is needed (X =< Y). The predicate returns different atoms (swap/no_swap) to indicate the result, which matches the requirement of being a logical predicate that determines whether to exchange elements. The implementation is correct and complete for its purpose.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

Note: The error message shown in the Result section appears to be unrelated to these two code blocks, as they are both valid Prolog predicates. The error seems to be coming from a different part of the code (possibly related to operator precedence in a different section).
