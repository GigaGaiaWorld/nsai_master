System: You are a helpful assistant that helps the user to generate deepproblog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.

% example from
% Antova, Koch, Olteanu
% Query language support for incomplete information in the MayBMS system
% VLDB 2007
%
% - 3 whales are seen in three closeby locations a,b,c
% - the one on position a is an adult orca (with identifier 3)
% - the other two are an adult and calf sperm whale (with IDs 2 and 1)
% - there are six possibilities for gender of the adults and positions of the sperm whales
% information shared by all worlds:
species(1,sperm).
gender(1,calf).
species(2,sperm).
species(3,orca).
position(3,a).
% information differing per world
position(1,b) :- world(a).
position(2,c) :- world(a).
gender(2,cow) :- world(a).
gender(3,cow) :- world(a).
position(1,b) :- world(b).
position(2,c) :- world(b).
gender(2,cow) :- world(b).
gender(3,bull) :- world(b).

<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form:

For the first Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```

For the second Code:
```problog 
{
    "HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
    "Code": "// Your fixed code here"
}
```
