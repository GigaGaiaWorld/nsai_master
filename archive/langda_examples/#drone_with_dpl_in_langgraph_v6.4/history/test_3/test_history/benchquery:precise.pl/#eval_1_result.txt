Here are the reports for each code block:

```report
{
    "HASH": "A37F4273",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the requirements for querying countries with approximately equal population density. It uses the inequality 20*D1 < 21*D2 to approximate D1/D2 < 1.05, which avoids division and decimals as required. The query format [C1,D1,C2,D2] is correctly specified. The code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "3A3D0149",
    "Report": "The code correctly implements the population density calculation using pop/2 and area/2. It multiplies the population P by 100 and then uses floor division (//) by area A to get an integer density value, as specified in the requirements. The code is syntactically correct and meets all requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false
}
