I'll regenerate the code blocks according to the analysis reports. Here are the fixes:

For the first incomplete code block (HASH: 3FEB17D7):

```problog
{
    "HASH": "3FEB17D7",
    "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; Winner = draw)."
}
```

For the other incomplete result predicates, here are the regenerated versions:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "N/A",
    "Code": "result(X, Y, win) :- beats(X, Y)."
}
```

```problog
{
    "HASH": "N/A",
    "Code": "result(X, Y, lose) :- beats(Y, X)."
}
```

For the compute_score predicates:

```problog
{
    "HASH": "N/A",
    "Code": "compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1."
}
```

```problog
{
    "HASH": "N/A",
    "Code": "compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1."
}
```

The main changes include:
1. Completing the determine_winner predicate with proper score calculation and winner determination
2. Fixing the result predicates to properly use the beats/2 relationship
3. Adding proper score computation for win/lose cases (adding 1 for win, subtracting 1 for lose)
4. Keeping the draw case as is (score remains unchanged)
