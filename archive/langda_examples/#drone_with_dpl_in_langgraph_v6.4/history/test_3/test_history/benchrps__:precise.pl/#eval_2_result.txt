    "Report": "The code block defines a predicate 'determine_winner/3' that takes two player move lists (P1Moves, P2Moves) and determines the Winner based on the results of playing those moves. The logic appears correct: it calls play/3 to get Results, computes the Score using compute_score/2, and then determines the Winner based on whether Score is positive (player1 wins), negative (player2 wins), or zero (draw). However, the error message suggests there might be an operator priority clash in the surrounding code (at position 17:20) when this rule is used in a larger context. The rule itself is syntactically correct for Prolog/ProbLog.",
