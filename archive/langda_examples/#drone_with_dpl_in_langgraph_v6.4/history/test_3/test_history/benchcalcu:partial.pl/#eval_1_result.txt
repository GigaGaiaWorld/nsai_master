    "Report": "The code appears to be a valid Prolog implementation of the cryptarithmetic puzzle SEND + MORE = MONEY. The logic correctly implements digit constraints, carry propagation, and uniqueness checks. However, the error message indicates a parsing issue with operator priority in the Problog engine. The main issues are:\n1. The '=\\=' operator might need proper spacing or different syntax in Problog\n2. Problog might require slightly different syntax for inequality checks\n3. The query format might need adjustment for Problog compatibility\n\nWhile the logic is correct for standard Prolog, it needs adaptation for Problog's specific syntax requirements.",
