  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, there are duplicate definitions for some predicates (e.g., prove(implies(P,Q)) and prove(opposite(P))), which causes syntax errors. Second, the formatting is inconsistent, leading to parsing errors. The logic of the generated code is similar to the original, but the syntax errors prevent it from running correctly. The original code runs successfully and produces the expected results, while the generated code fails due to parsing errors."
