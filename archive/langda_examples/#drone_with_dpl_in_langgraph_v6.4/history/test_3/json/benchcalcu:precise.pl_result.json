  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there are some issues with the formatting and redundancy in the generated code. Specifically, the sumdigit(0, D, E, Y, C1) predicate is duplicated, and there are unnecessary line breaks and comments that disrupt the flow. Despite these issues, the logic remains intact, and the running results are identical to the original code."
