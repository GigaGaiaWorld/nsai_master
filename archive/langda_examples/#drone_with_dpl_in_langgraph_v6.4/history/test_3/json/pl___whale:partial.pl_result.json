  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but contains some formatting issues (unnecessary line breaks and duplicate probability declarations for worlds). These issues do not affect the logical structure but are syntactically redundant. The main problem is that the generated code produces different results from the original code, particularly in the probabilities for 'attack' and 'abandon' queries, indicating a potential logical inconsistency or error in the generated code."
