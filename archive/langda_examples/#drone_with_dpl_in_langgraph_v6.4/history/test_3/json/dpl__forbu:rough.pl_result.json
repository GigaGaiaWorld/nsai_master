  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubblesort algorithm compatible with DeepProbLog but contains several issues. The main problem is the use of an unsupported '->' operator in the bubblesort predicate, which causes the execution error. The original code successfully implements a working bubblesort, while the generated code fails to run due to syntax errors. The generated code also includes unnecessary elements like a dummy probabilistic fact that don't contribute to the sorting functionality."
