  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog with the same logic and structure. The only minor issue is the duplicate append predicate and query at the end of the generated code, which is redundant but does not affect functionality. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the correct sorted list."
