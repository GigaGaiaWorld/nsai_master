  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it contains duplicate clauses for 'zebra(Houses)' and duplicate definitions of helper predicates like 'houses', 'right_of', 'next_to', and 'my_member'. Second, the attribute order in the 'house' predicate is inconsistent with the original code, which leads to logical errors. Third, there is a syntax error with an extra '.' after 'query(zebra(Houses))'. These problems make the generated code invalid and unable to produce the correct result."
