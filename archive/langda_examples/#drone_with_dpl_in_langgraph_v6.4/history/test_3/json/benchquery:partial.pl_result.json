  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and structure. Both codes aim to find countries with approximately equal population density. The generated code maintains the same predicates and calculations as the original. However, there are minor formatting differences, such as inconsistent line breaks and spacing in the generated code, which do not affect the functionality. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code performs as expected."
