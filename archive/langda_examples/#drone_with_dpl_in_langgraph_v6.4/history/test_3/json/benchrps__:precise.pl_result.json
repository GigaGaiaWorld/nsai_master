Specifically, there are duplicate predicate definitions (e.g., 'result(X, X, draw)' is defined twice), incorrect operator usage, and misplaced clauses. These issues prevent the code from running successfully, as evidenced by the parse error. In contrast, the original code is well-structured and runs without errors, producing the expected result. The generated code does not meet the requirements and fails to achieve consistency with the original code in both form and result."
