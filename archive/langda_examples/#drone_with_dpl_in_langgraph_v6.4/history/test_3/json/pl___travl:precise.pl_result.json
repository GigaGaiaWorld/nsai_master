  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it contains redundant declarations such as duplicate 'person(a).', 'person(b).', and repeated rules for 'initialInf(X)', 'contact(X,Y)', 'susceptible(X)', and 'riskyTravel(X)'. These redundancies do not affect the logical correctness but make the code less clean. The main issue is that the generated code produces different results (0.2416 vs. 0.1245) compared to the original code, indicating a potential problem in the probabilistic calculations or rule applications."
