  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it redundantly repeats the digit facts and the addition rule, which is unnecessary and makes the code less clean. Second, there is a syntax error with a misplaced period before the second query. Despite these issues, the core logic of the addition rule is correct and matches the original code. The run results are consistent with the original code, showing the correct addition of 5 and 6 as 11, but there is an additional redundant result (addition(img_5,img_6,X2)) due to the duplicated query."
