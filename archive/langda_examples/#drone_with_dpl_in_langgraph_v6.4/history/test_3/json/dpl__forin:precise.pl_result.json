  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet expectations. It contains duplicate definitions of 'insertion_sort' and 'insert_element' predicates, which leads to confusion and errors. Additionally, the generated code introduces unnecessary 'number(X), number(H)' checks that are not present in the original code. The error in the run result indicates a problem with argument types, likely due to the duplicated and inconsistent predicate definitions. The generated code is not consistent with the original code and fails to produce the correct result."
