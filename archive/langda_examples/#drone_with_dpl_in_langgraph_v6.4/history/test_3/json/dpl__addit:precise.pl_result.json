The 'number' predicate is defined twice with different arities, and there's a misplaced clause in 'multi_addition'. The code fails to parse due to operator priority clash errors. While the intention to handle multi-digit numbers is a logical extension of the original single-digit addition, the implementation is incorrect and doesn't produce valid results."
