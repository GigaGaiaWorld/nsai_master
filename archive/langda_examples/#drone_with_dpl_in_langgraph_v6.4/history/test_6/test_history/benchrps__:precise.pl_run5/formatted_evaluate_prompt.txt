</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The code aims to implement a rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for moves, win/lose relationships, and a mechanism to determine the winner based on a series of moves. However, the test results indicate a syntax error ("Ambiguous token role"), which prevents the code from being executed. The logical structure of the code appears sound, but the syntax issues need to be addressed.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Error**: The error "Ambiguous token role" suggests that the ProbLog parser encountered an ambiguous or invalid token in the code. This is likely due to incorrect syntax or misplaced symbols.
2. **Logical Issue**: The `determine_winner` predicate is not properly integrated with the rest of the code, and its definition is duplicated in the code block, which could lead to confusion or errors.
3. **Integration Issue**: The `query` at the end of the code is not properly formatted or integrated, which may contribute to the parsing error.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "3FEB17D7",
        "Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate is defined twice in the code, which is redundant and could cause ambiguity. The second definition is incomplete and lacks proper syntax. Additionally, the `query` at the end of the code is not properly formatted, leading to the parsing error."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax Errors**: Remove the duplicate definition of `determine_winner` and ensure the remaining definition is syntactically correct. Pay attention to the placement of commas and semicolons.
2. **Format the Query Properly**: Ensure the `query` is correctly formatted and placed at the end of the code.
3. **Test Incrementally**: After fixing the syntax, test the code incrementally to ensure each part (e.g., `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3`) works as expected.
4. **Use Proper ProbLog Syntax**: Refer to ProbLog documentation to ensure all predicates and queries follow the correct syntax.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
