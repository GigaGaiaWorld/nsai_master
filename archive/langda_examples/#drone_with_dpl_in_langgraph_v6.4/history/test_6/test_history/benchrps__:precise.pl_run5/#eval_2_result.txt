  "Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate is incomplete and improperly formatted. The predicate is fragmented, with parts of the logic appearing outside the intended block. Additionally, the predicate lacks proper indentation and structure, which likely contributes to the parsing error. The logic itself (calculating the winner based on the score) is correct, but the implementation is flawed. Regeneration is needed to fix the syntax and ensure proper integration with the rest of the code.",
