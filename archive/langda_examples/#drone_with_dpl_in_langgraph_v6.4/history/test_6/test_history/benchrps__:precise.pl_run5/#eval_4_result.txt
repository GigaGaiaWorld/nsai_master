  "Report": "The `determine_winner` predicate in this code block is defined correctly and implements the required logic to determine the winner based on the results of the game rounds. However, the test failure indicates a syntax error ('Ambiguous token role') which is likely due to issues outside this code block, such as the duplicate definition of `determine_winner` or the improperly formatted `query` at the end of the original code. This code block itself is logically sound and does not need regeneration, but the surrounding context needs to be fixed to resolve the parsing error.",
