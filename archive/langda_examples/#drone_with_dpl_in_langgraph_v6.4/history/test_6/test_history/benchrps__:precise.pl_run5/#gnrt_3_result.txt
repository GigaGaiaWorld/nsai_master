Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n compute_score(Results, S),\n ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n ; S = 0 -> Winner = draw\n )."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <langda> in the origin_code and was completed in the generated_code. The JSON includes:
- The HASH value from the origin_code
- The completed code implementation from the generated_code
- Proper formatting with newlines preserved as \n for readability
