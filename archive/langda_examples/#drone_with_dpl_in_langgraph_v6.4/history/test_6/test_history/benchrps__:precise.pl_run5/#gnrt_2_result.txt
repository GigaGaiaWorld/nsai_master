Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` blocks in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n compute_score(Results, S),\n ( S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n ; S = 0 -> Winner = draw\n )."}
```

Note: There was only one `<langda>` block in the original code, so only one corresponding code block was extracted from the generated code. The hash "3FEB17D7" was preserved from the original `<langda>` block to maintain traceability.
