System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Code_Block>% Merge Sort Algorithm in Problog

% Base case for an empty list
merge_sort([], []).

% Base case for a single-element list
merge_sort([X], [X]).

% Recursive case: split the list, sort the halves, and merge them
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

% Split the list into two halves
split(List, Left, Right) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Half is Len // 2,
    length(Left, Half),
    append(Left, Right, List).

% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([LeftHead|LeftTail], [RightHead|RightTail], [LeftHead|Merged]) :-
    LeftHead @=< RightHead,
    merge(LeftTail, [RightHead|RightTail], Merged).
merge([LeftHead|LeftTail], [RightHead|RightTail], [RightHead|Merged]) :-
    LeftHead @> RightHead,
    merge([LeftHead|LeftTail], RightTail, Merged).</Code_Block>
<Report>The code block implements a merge sort algorithm in Problog but contains logical errors. The `merge/3` predicate incorrectly merges lists due to flawed comparison logic (`LeftHead @=< RightHead` and `LeftHead @> RightHead`), resulting in incorrect sorting. The `split/3` predicate also has issues, as it does not accurately divide the list into equal halves, which is critical for merge sort. Testing revealed incorrect output (`[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]` instead of `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`). The requirements for an interpretable merge sort are not fully met.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
