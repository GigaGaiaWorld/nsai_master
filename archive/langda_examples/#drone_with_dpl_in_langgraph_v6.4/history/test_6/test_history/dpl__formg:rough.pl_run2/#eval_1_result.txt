    "Report": "The code block implements a merge sort algorithm in Problog but contains logical errors. The `merge/3` predicate incorrectly merges lists due to flawed comparison logic (`LeftHead @=< RightHead` and `LeftHead @> RightHead`), resulting in incorrect sorting. The `split/3` predicate also has issues, as it does not accurately divide the list into equal halves, which is critical for merge sort. Testing revealed incorrect output (`[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]` instead of `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`). The requirements for an interpretable merge sort are not fully met.",
