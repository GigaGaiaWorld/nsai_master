Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> block in the <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).\nstack_op(pop, [X|Stack], Stack).\nstack_op(dup, [X|Stack], [X,X|Stack]).\nstack_op(swap, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X|Stack]).\nstack_op(over, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X,Y|Stack]).\nstack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Stack], [Y,Z,X|Stack])."}
```

Note: The original <langda> block only specified the hash and requirements for implementing stack operations, but didn't mark specific code sections to be completed. I've extracted all the basic stack operation implementations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that were added in the generated code, as these appear to fulfill the stated requirements of "implementing a series of stack operations". The sort operation was already present in the original code.
