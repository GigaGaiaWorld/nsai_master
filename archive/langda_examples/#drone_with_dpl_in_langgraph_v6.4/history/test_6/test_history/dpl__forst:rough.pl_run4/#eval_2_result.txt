  "Report": "The code block correctly implements basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) as confirmed by test results. However, it includes an incomplete `sort` operation that lacks the required `insertion_sort` predicate and is untested. The core functionality is correct, but the incomplete part affects overall robustness.",
