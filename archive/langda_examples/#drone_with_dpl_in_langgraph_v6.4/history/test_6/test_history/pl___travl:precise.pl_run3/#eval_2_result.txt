  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate contains a critical syntax error in the conditional logic (`->/2` operator), causing the ProbLog engine to fail. The implementation does not correctly reflect the requirements for conditional probabilities in contact transmission (0.8 for susceptible, 0.6 otherwise) or the integration of `riskyTravel/1`. The logic needs to be restructured to use valid ProbLog syntax for conditionals and properly combine probabilities.",
