  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate currently only implements the initial infection probability (0.1) and does not account for contact transmission or travel risk as specified in the requirements. The predicate should be enhanced to include: (1) contact transmission logic (0.6 probability for non-susceptible, 0.8 for susceptible), and (2) travel risk logic (additional 0.2 probability). The current implementation is incomplete and leads to incorrect probability calculations in the test results.",
