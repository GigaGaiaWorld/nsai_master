    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog. The predicates insert/3 and insertion_sort/2 are logically and recursively defined, adhering to insertion sort principles. The test result confirms the implementation sorts [3,1,2,5,7,12] correctly with a probability of 1.0000. No syntax or logical errors were found, and the implementation meets the specified requirements for an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm.",
