{"HASH": "766936E0","Report": "The code implements the requirement for multiplayer teams by taking the minimum strength of all members. However, this may not be the most intuitive or fair way to calculate team strength, especially if one member's strength is significantly lower due to laziness. This could skew the results. The test results suggest that this logic may need refinement to better reflect the team's overall capability.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "2A6AD51D","Report": "The code correctly implements the requirement for determining the winner based on team strength. However, the issue lies in how the team strength is calculated (specifically in the '766936E0' block), which affects the outcome. This block does not need regeneration itself, but its correctness depends on the regeneration of the '766936E0' block.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": ["766936E0"]}
