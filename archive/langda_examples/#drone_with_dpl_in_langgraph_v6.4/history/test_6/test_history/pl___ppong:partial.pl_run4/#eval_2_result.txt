  "Report": "The `team_strength` predicate correctly implements the requirement of calculating the team strength as the minimum of all members' strengths. The logic is syntactically and semantically correct, and the test results align with the expected behavior. However, the predicate is split into two parts in the code (one incomplete and one complete), which could be confusing. While this does not affect functionality, merging the two parts would improve readability and maintainability.",
