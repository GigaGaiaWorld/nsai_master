Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section:

```problog
{"HASH": "F46C6231", "Code": "1/6::world(a); 1/6::world(b); 1/6::world(c); 1/6::world(d); 1/6::world(e); 1/6::world(f)."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <langda> in the origin_code, and it appears unchanged in the generated_code. The JSON format includes the hash from the original report and the completed code snippet that fulfills the requirement of defining a uniform distribution over the six worlds.
