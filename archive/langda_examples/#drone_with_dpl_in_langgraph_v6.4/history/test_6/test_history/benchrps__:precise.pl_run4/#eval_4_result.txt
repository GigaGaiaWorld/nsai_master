  "Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate is syntactically correct but has logical flaws. It checks for list validity and equal length but does not ensure the `play/3` predicate is called correctly. The `compute_score/2` predicate is correctly implemented, but the integration with `play/3` is flawed, leading to incorrect results. The test failure (probability 0.0000) indicates the predicate is not functioning as intended. The predicate should be regenerated to properly integrate `play/3` and `compute_score/2` and handle edge cases like unequal list lengths.",

  "Report": "The `result/3` predicate is incomplete. The `draw` case is missing its body, which should include `move(X)` to ensure the move is valid. The `play/3` predicate is syntactically correct but lacks proper error handling for unequal list lengths. The `compute_score/2` predicate is correctly implemented. This block needs regeneration to fix the `result/3` predicate and improve `play/3` to handle edge cases.",
