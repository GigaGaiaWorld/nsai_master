  "Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate has logical flaws. It checks for valid moves and equal lengths of move lists but does not ensure the `play/3` predicate correctly processes the moves. The `result/3` predicate does not handle all cases, leading to incorrect results. The test query fails because the logic does not propagate the results correctly. Recommendations include fixing the `result/3` predicate, properly integrating `valid_moves/1`, debugging the `play/3` predicate, testing edge cases, and reviewing score calculation.",
