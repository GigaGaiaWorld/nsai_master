Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> blocks in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7", "Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n is_list(P1Moves), is_list(P2Moves),\n length(P1Moves, Len1), length(P2Moves, Len2),\n Len1 =:= Len2,\n maplist(move, P1Moves), maplist(move, P2Moves),\n play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n compute_score(Results, S),\n ( S > 0, Winner = player1\n ; S < 0, Winner = player2\n ; S = 0, Winner = draw\n )."}
```

Note: There was only one <langda> block in the origin code, so only one corresponding code block was extracted from the generated code. The hash "3FEB17D7" was preserved from the original <langda> block to maintain correspondence.
