{"HASH": "FD850DEC","Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly implements the requirement for handling draws by passing the previous score unchanged. However, the predicate could be optimized for clarity by simplifying the arithmetic operation (`S is S1` is redundant). No logical or syntax errors are present, and the test results confirm its correctness.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7","Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate is logically correct but has syntactic issues (misplaced comma, inconsistent formatting) and lacks input validation (e.g., ensuring `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists of valid moves). It also does not handle edge cases like empty lists or unequal lengths. The test result confirms its basic functionality, but regeneration is recommended to address these issues.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A","Report": "The `result/3` predicate (not explicitly tagged with a HASH) has an incomplete clause (`result(X, X, draw) :-` is missing the body). This affects the correctness of the entire program, including `determine_winner/3`. Regeneration is required to fix this issue.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": ["3FEB17D7"]}
