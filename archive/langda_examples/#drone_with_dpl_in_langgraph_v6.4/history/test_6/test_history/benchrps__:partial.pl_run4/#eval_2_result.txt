{"HASH": "58D60F5E","Report": "The `beats(scissors, paper).` predicate is correctly implemented as per the requirements. However, there is a typographical error in the preceding `beats(rock, scissor).` predicate (not in this code block), which should be `beats(rock, scissors).`. This code block itself does not need regeneration.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

Note: The second code block (`58D60F5E`) is actually correct in its implementation of `beats(scissors, paper).`, but there's a related error in another `beats` predicate that's not part of this code block. The first code block (`BF964057`) definitely needs regeneration due to the typographical error.
