However, it lacks integration with the main parse/2 predicate which is required for the complete solution. The predicates themselves are logically correct but remain unused in the current implementation.

This is the root cause of the test failure ('UnknownClause for parse/2'). A new implementation of parse/2 needs to be generated that: 1) Handles base cases for single numbers 2) Uses split_lowest_precedence to break down expressions 3) Recursively evaluates sub-expressions 4) Applies operators with proper precedence handling.",
