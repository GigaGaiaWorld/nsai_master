  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is partially implemented but lacks the supporting predicates (`split_lowest_precedence/4` and `apply_operator/4`) required for its functionality. The logic for splitting expressions based on operator precedence and applying the operators is missing, leading to a runtime error. To fix this, the missing predicates need to be implemented. Specifically, `split_lowest_precedence/4` should split the input expression into left and right sub-expressions based on the lowest precedence operator, and `apply_operator/4` should apply the arithmetic operation specified by the operator. Without these, the `parse/2` predicate cannot function correctly.",
