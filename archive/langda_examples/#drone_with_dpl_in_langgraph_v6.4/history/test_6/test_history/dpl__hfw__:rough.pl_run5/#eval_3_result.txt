  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is partially implemented but lacks the supporting predicates (`split_lowest_precedence/4` and `apply_operator/4`). The logic for splitting expressions and applying operators is missing, leading to runtime errors. Additionally, the predicate does not account for operator precedence or associativity, which are necessary for correct evaluation. The code block needs regeneration to include these missing components and ensure proper arithmetic expression evaluation.",
