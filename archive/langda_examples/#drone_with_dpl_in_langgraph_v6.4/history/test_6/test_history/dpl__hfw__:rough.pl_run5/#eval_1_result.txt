  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate has significant logical flaws in its implementation. It processes operations left-associatively without respecting operator precedence (PEMDAS/BODMAS rules), leading to incorrect evaluation of nested expressions. For example, the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7` should evaluate to `(2 / 3) + (3 - (2 * 7))` = -10.333..., but the current implementation processes it as `(((2 / 3) + 3) - 2) * 7`, which is incorrect. The predicate needs to be restructured to handle operator precedence and associativity correctly.",
