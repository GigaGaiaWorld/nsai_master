System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>

digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).

    number(T, N1),
    N is N1 * 10 + D.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 06576BEB </HASH>
<Requirements>define number predicate, to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. </Requirements></Langda>
.
multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,X2),number(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],310) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements to some extent. The `digit/2` facts correctly map image IDs to their corresponding digits, and the `number/2` predicate successfully converts a list of image IDs into an integer. The `multi_addition/3` predicate and the query demonstrate the intended functionality of adding two numbers derived from lists of image IDs. However, the test result reveals a logical error in the implementation of the `multi_addition/3` predicate, as the output does not match the expected sum of the two numbers.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Logical Error in `multi_addition/3`**: The predicate `multi_addition/3` incorrectly computes the sum of the two numbers derived from the lists of image IDs. The test result shows `310` as the output, which is the concatenation of the two numbers (`79` and `312`), not their sum (`79 + 312 = 391`).
2. **Missing Edge Cases**: The `number/2` predicate does not handle edge cases such as an empty list (though the base case is defined, it is not tested).
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "06576BEB",
        "Report": "The `number/2` predicate is logically correct and adheres to the requirements. It recursively processes the list of image IDs and constructs the corresponding integer. However, the base case `number([], 0).` is not tested in the provided query, so its correctness under edge cases is not verified."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for `multi_addition/3`)",
        "Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate contains a logical error. Instead of summing the two numbers (`X2` and `Y2`), it concatenates them, leading to an incorrect result. For example, `multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], Z)` should yield `Z = 391`, but it yields `Z = 310`."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix `multi_addition/3`**: Modify the predicate to correctly sum the two numbers instead of concatenating them. The corrected predicate should be:
   

2. **Test Edge Cases**: Add test cases for the `number/2` predicate to verify its behavior with an empty list and other edge cases.
3. **Verify Correctness**: After fixing the `multi_addition/3` predicate, rerun the test to ensure the output matches the expected sum (`391` for the given example).
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
