  "Report": "The `multi_addition/3` predicate contains a logical error. Instead of summing the two numbers (`X2` and `Y2`), it concatenates them, leading to an incorrect result. For example, `multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], Z)` should yield `Z = 391`, but it yields `Z = 310`. This predicate needs regeneration to correctly implement the addition of the two numbers derived from the lists of image IDs.",
