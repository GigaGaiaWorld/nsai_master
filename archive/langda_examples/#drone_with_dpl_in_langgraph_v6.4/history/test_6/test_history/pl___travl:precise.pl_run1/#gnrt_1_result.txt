Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <Langda> section:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\ninf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X), 0.6::inf(X).\ninf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X), 0.8::inf(X).\ninf(X) :- riskyTravel(X), 0.2::inf(X)."}
```

Note: 
1. I've included all the clauses for the `inf/1` predicate from the generated_code that correspond to the requirements mentioned in the <Langda> section.
2. The hash "E09B4F54" is taken directly from the <HASH> tag in the origin_code.
3. The code includes all the required components: initial infection, contact transmission (both for susceptible and non-susceptible cases), and travel risk.
4. The backslash in `\+susceptible(X)` is properly escaped in the JSON format.
