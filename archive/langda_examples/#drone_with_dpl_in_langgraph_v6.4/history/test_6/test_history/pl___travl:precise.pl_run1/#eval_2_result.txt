  "Report": "The code block for `inf/1` predicate has significant logical issues. The test results show only initial infection probabilities (0.1) without accounting for contact transmission or travel risk probabilities as specified in requirements. Key problems include: 1) Contact transmission rules don't properly propagate probabilities (0.6/0.8) from infected contacts, 2) Travel risk probability (0.2) isn't being incorporated, 3) The negation operator `\+susceptible(X)` may not be functioning as intended. The rules need complete restructuring to properly combine probabilities from all infection sources.",
