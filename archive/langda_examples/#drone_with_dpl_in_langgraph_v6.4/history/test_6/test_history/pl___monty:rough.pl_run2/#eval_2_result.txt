  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has the following issues:\n1. **Syntax Error**: The conditional logic (`->`) is not correctly formatted for ProbLog. ProbLog does not support the Prolog-style `->` operator for conditional branching.\n2. **Probabilistic Behavior**: The requirement to randomly open one of the two empty doors with a 50% probability is not correctly implemented. The current code attempts to use `0.5::open_door(Door)`, but this is not valid ProbLog syntax for conditional probabilities.\n3. **Deterministic Behavior**: The deterministic scenario where the host must open the empty door is not enforced correctly. The current implementation does not guarantee that the host will always open the empty door in this scenario.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Replace the Prolog-style conditional logic with ProbLog-compatible constructs.\n2. Use ProbLog's probabilistic syntax to define the 50% probability for opening one of the two empty doors when the prize door matches the selected door.\n3. Explicitly select the empty door in the deterministic scenario to ensure the host always opens the empty door when the prize door does not match the selected door.",
