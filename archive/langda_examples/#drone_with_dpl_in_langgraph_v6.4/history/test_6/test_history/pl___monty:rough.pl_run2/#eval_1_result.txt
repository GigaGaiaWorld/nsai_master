  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has the following issues:\n1. **Syntax Error**: The conditional logic (`->`) is not correctly formatted for ProbLog. ProbLog does not support Prolog-style conditionals directly; instead, probabilistic conditions must be handled using annotated disjunctions or other probabilistic constructs.\n2. **Logical Error**: The probabilistic behavior (50% chance to open one of the two empty doors) is not correctly implemented. The current implementation does not ensure that the host opens one of the two empty doors with equal probability.\n3. **Deterministic Behavior**: The deterministic behavior (host must open the empty door) is not enforced correctly. The current implementation does not guarantee that the host will always open the empty door when the prize door does not match the selected door.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Replace the Prolog-style conditional (`->`) with ProbLog-compatible constructs, such as annotated disjunctions or probabilistic facts.\n2. Use ProbLog's probabilistic syntax to ensure the host opens one of the two empty doors with a 50% probability when the prize door matches the selected door.\n3. Ensure the host always opens the empty door when the prize door does not match the selected door.\n4. Test the integration with `win_keep` and `win_switch` predicates after fixing the `open_door/1` predicate.",
