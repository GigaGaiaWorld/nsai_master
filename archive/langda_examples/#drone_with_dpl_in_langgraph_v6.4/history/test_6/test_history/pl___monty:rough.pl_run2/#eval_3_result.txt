  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has significant issues that require regeneration. The problems include: 1) Logical error in mixing probabilistic and deterministic behavior in a single clause, 2) Syntax error with invalid ProbLog syntax (`0.5::open_door(Door)`), 3) Incomplete implementation of host behavior rules. The predicate needs to be split into separate cases for probabilistic (when player's door has prize) and deterministic (when player's door doesn't have prize) scenarios. Probabilistic choices should be defined at the top level. The current implementation could lead to incorrect behavior in the Monty Hall simulation.",
