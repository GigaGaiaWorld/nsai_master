  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate implementation has the following issues: 1) The probabilistic and deterministic cases overlap in their conditions, which could lead to ambiguity in execution. 2) The probabilistic case uses a hardcoded 50% probability without clear documentation of why this value is chosen. 3) The implementation could be more explicit about handling edge cases, such as when the player's initial selection is the prize door. Recommendations: 1) Restructure the conditions to make them mutually exclusive. 2) Add comments explaining the 50% probability choice. 3) Explicitly handle edge cases for clarity. Despite these issues, the code functions correctly for the Monty Hall problem as evidenced by the test results.",
