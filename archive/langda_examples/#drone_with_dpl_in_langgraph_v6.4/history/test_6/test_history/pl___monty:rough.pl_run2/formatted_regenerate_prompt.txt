System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The `open_door/1` predicate is partially implemented. It correctly handles the probabilistic scenario (randomly opening one of two empty doors with 50% probability) but fails to address the deterministic scenario (host must open the empty door when one of the remaining doors has a prize). The predicate should be split into two cases: one for the probabilistic scenario and another for the deterministic scenario. Additionally, the current implementation does not properly enforce the constraints for the deterministic scenario, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the Monty Hall problem simulation.</Report>

<Requirements>Define open_door/1 Predicate: Random Door Opening Rules Scenario: The remaining two doors are neither selected by the player nor have any prizes. Behavior: The host randomly opens one of the two "empty doors" with a 50% probability. Deterministic Door Opening Rules Scenario: The remaining two doors are neither selected by the player, one of which has a prize and the other does not. Behavior: The host must open the "empty door". </Requirements></Langda>

AI: 


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
