  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate is partially implemented. It correctly handles the probabilistic scenario (randomly opening one of two empty doors with 50% probability) but fails to address the deterministic scenario (host must open the empty door when one of the remaining doors has a prize). The predicate should be split into two cases: one for the probabilistic scenario and another for the deterministic scenario. Additionally, the current implementation does not properly enforce the constraints for the deterministic scenario, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the Monty Hall problem simulation.",
