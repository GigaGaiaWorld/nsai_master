Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE","Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)."}
```

This is the only code block that was generated to replace the <Langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The hash tag matches the one provided in the <Langda> section (A90B08DE), and the code implements the specified requirements for the abandon predicate.
