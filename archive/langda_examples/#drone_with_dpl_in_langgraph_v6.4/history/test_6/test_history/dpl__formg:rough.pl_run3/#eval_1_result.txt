The code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm as evidenced by the successful test case. However, the split/4 predicate assumes the input list is long enough to split, which could be problematic for very short lists. The merge/3 predicate handles duplicates implicitly but could be made more explicit if required. The code meets the requirements but could benefit from minor improvements for robustness.",

It does not cover edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, or lists with duplicates. The append/3 definition should be removed to avoid redundancy, and additional test cases should be added for comprehensive testing.",
