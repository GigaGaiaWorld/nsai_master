System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).

merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    Half is Len // 2,
    split(List, Half, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

split(List, N, Left, Right) :-
    length(Left, N),
    append(Left, Right, List).

merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X|Left], [Y|Right], [X|Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Left, [Y|Right], Merged).
merge([X|Left], [Y|Right], [Y|Merged]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X|Left], Right, Merged).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 418D2062 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable merge_sort/2 algorithm </Requirements></Langda>
.
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test result shows that it correctly sorts the input list [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12] into [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] with a probability of 1.0000. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the given test case. However, there are minor issues related to code organization and potential edge cases that need to be addressed." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No critical errors were found in the code. The issues identified are related to code structure and potential edge cases, such as handling empty lists or lists with duplicate elements." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "418D2062",
        "Report": "The merge_sort/2 predicate is correctly implemented, and the auxiliary predicates split/4 and merge/3 are also logically sound. However, the split/4 predicate assumes that the input list is long enough to split into two parts, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the merge/3 predicate does not explicitly handle duplicate elements, though it works correctly for the given test case."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The append/3 predicate is correctly defined but is redundant since it is already included in the ProbLog standard library. The query merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X) is correctly executed, but the test case does not cover edge cases like empty lists or lists with duplicate elements."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Remove the redundant append/3 predicate since it is already part of the ProbLog standard library. 2. Add test cases for edge cases, such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate elements. 3. Consider adding a check in the split/4 predicate to handle cases where the input list is too short to split. 4. Ensure the merge/3 predicate explicitly handles duplicate elements if required by the application." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
