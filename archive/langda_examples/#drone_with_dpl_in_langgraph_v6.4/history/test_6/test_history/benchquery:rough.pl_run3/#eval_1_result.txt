  "Report": "The `density/2` predicate is correctly defined to calculate population density. However, it is not integrated into a larger query or comparison logic. The error suggests that the predicate is not being called properly, possibly due to an incorrect query structure. The predicate itself is syntactically correct and logically sound for calculating density, but it lacks the necessary context to fulfill the overall requirement of comparing densities between countries.",
