  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate correctly implements recursive evaluation of arithmetic expressions, fulfilling the requirements for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division processing. However, the output format is nested and not user-friendly (e.g., `*(-(+(/(2,3),3),2),7)`). Additionally, the predicate lacks error handling for division by zero and invalid operators. The logical flow is correct, but improvements are needed for usability and robustness.",
