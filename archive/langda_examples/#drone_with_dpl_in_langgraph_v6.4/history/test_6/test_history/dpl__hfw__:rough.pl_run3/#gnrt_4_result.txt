Here is the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "190031BC","Code": "parse([N], N).\nparse([N, O, M | T], Result) :-\n    (O == '/' -> (M =:= 0 -> Result = 'Error: Division by zero'; Op =.. [O, N, M], parse([Op | T], Result))\n    ; Op =.. [O, N, M], parse([Op | T], Result))."}
```

This JSON object contains:
- The `HASH` from the original `<langda>` block
- The completed `parse/2` predicate code from the `<generated_code>` which now includes division by zero error handling
