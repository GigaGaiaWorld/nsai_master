Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code was about the `parse/2` predicate, which was modified in the generated_code. Here's the extracted code block in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "190031BC","Code": "parse([N], N).\nparse([N, O, M | T], Result) :-\n    Op =.. [O, N, M],\n    parse([Op | T], Result)."}
```

This is the only code block that was modified from the original <langda> section. The generated version simplifies the parsing logic by using the `=..` operator uniformly for all operations instead of having special handling for division.
