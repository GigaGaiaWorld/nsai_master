  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate fails to correctly evaluate arithmetic expressions due to incorrect operator handling (particularly division) and improper accumulation of intermediate results. The error message indicates it's trying to use `//2` (integer division) instead of `/` (floating-point division). The predicate needs to be regenerated to: 1) Correctly handle all operator types including proper division, 2) Implement proper recursive evaluation with intermediate result accumulation, and 3) Match the operator symbols with those defined in `detect_operator` facts.",
