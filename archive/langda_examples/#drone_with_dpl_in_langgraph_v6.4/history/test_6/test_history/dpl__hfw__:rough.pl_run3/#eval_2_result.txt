  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is flawed in its handling of arithmetic operations. The use of `->` for conditional logic is incorrect in ProbLog, and the predicate does not properly evaluate intermediate results. Additionally, the predicate does not account for operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluations. The test results show a failure due to an unknown clause for the division operation, indicating improper handling of arithmetic operations in the recursive parsing logic.",
