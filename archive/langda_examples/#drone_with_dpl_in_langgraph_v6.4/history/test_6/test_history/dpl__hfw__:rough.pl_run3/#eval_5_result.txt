  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is the core of the expression evaluator but contains critical issues. The primary problem is the use of `->` for conditional logic, which is not correctly handled by ProbLog, leading to the `UnknownClause` error. Additionally, the predicate fails to properly handle operator precedence and nested expressions. The division check (`M =:= 0`) is syntactically incorrect in this context and should be integrated differently. The use of `=..` for operator construction is also problematic. The predicate needs a complete rewrite to use separate clauses for each operator and to ensure recursive evaluation works correctly.",
