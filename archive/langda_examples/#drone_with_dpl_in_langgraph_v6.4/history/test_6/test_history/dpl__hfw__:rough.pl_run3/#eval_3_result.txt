  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate contains critical logical flaws, particularly in handling the division operator (`/`). The use of `->` for conditional logic is incorrect and leads to an 'Unknown Clause' error. The predicate fails to properly accumulate intermediate results during recursive evaluation. It should be rewritten to handle all operators uniformly (+, -, *, /) without conditional logic. The predicate must also ensure proper chaining of operations for correct arithmetic evaluation. The current implementation does not meet the requirements for a recursive expression evaluator.",
