Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "190031BC", "Code": "parse([N], N).\nparse([N, O, M | T], Result) :-\n    Op =.. [O, N, M],\n    Op,\n    parse([Op | T], Result)."}
```

This is the only code block that corresponds to the `<langda>` section in the original code, which specifically requested a recursive expression evaluator (`parse/2`) that can handle arithmetic operations. The hash "190031BC" was provided in the original `<langda>` section.
