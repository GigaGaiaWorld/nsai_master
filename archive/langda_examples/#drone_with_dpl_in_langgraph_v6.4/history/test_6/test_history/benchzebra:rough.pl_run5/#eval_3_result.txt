  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks critical constraints for solving the zebra puzzle. Key issues include:\n1. Missing uniqueness constraints for attributes (colors, nationalities, pets, etc.).\n2. Partially implemented puzzle clues (e.g., Norwegian's position, house colors).\n3. Potential infinite recursion in `next_to`, `right_of`, and `my_member` predicates.\n4. Inefficient logic leading to timeout errors.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Add all missing puzzle constraints to the `zebra` predicate.\n2. Enforce uniqueness for all attributes.\n3. Optimize recursive predicates to ensure termination.\n4. Test incrementally to identify problematic constraints.",
