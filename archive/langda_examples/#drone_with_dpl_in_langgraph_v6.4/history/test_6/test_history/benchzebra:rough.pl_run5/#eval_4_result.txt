It also does not fully implement all the constraints required for the zebra puzzle. The timeout error suggests that the code may be stuck in an infinite loop or is too inefficient.

However, the `query(zebra(Houses))` at the end is not properly integrated with the rest of the code, which may lead to execution issues.
