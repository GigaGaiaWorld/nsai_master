Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "zebra(Houses) :-\n    houses(Houses),\n    my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, spanish, dog, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),\n    Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _,_],\n    Houses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)|_],\n    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,chesterfields), house(_,_,fox,_,_), Houses),\n    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,kools), house(_,_,horse,_,_), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),\n    next_to(house(_,norwegian,_,_,_), house(blue,_,_,_,_), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)."}
```

This is the completed zebra/1 predicate that was originally incomplete in the <Langda> section of the origin_code. I've maintained the same hash (0F506A43) that was provided in the origin_code for identification.
