  "Report": "The code block defines the `zebra` predicate with constraints for the zebra puzzle. Key issues include: 1) Timeout during execution, indicating inefficiency or infinite loops; 2) Missing uniqueness checks for attributes (colors, nationalities, pets, etc.); 3) Potential logical gaps in constraint ordering or implementation. Recommendations: 1) Optimize constraints by reordering deterministic ones first; 2) Add uniqueness checks; 3) Debug with smaller constraint subsets to isolate bottlenecks; 4) Ensure all puzzle rules are correctly implemented.",
