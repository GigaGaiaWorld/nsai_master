Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "zebra(Houses) :-\n    houses(Houses),\n    my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, spanish, dog, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),\n    Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _,_],\n    Houses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)|_],\n    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,chesterfields), house(_,_,fox,_,_), Houses),\n    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,kools), house(_,_,horse,_,_), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),\n    next_to(house(_,norwegian,_,_,_), house(blue,_,_,_,_), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),\n    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)."}
```

Note: I've used the HASH value provided in the <Langda> section (0F506A43) and formatted the complete zebra predicate that was generated to replace the <Langda> block in the original code. The code block includes all the constraints for solving the zebra puzzle.
