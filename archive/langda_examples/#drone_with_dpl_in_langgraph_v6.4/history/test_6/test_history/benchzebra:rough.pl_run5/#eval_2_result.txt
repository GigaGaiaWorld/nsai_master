  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and contains syntax errors. The `zebra(Houses)` predicate is missing a closing parenthesis and semicolon. Additionally, the constraints in the predicate may not be sufficient to solve the puzzle, leading to potential infinite loops or inefficiencies. The timeout error during testing suggests that the logic is either incorrect or too inefficient. Recommendations include fixing syntax errors, completing the logic, optimizing performance, and testing incrementally.",
