  "Report": "The `abandon` predicate is correctly implemented as `abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c).`, which matches the requirements. However, the predicate name is misspelled as `abandon` in the query, which could cause confusion. The predicate could be documented more clearly to reflect the requirement that it represents abandonment when the adult sperm whale is at position `c`. The test results show uniform probabilities, which align with the logic, but the predicate's name in the query should be corrected for consistency.",
