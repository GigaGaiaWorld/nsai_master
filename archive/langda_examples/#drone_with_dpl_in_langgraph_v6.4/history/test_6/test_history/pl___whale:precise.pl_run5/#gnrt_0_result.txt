Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)."}
```

This is the only code block that was generated to replace the <Langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The code implements the requirement specified in the <Langda> section, defining when an adult sperm whale abandons the calf based on their genders and position.
