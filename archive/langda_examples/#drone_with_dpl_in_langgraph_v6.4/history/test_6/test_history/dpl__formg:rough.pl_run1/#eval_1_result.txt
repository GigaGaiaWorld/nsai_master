  "Report": "The merge_sort/2 predicate is correctly implemented and handles base cases (empty list and single-element list) as well as the recursive case. The split/3 predicate divides the list into two halves, and the merge/3 predicate combines two sorted lists into one. The logic is sound, but the split/3 predicate could be simplified for readability. The append/3 predicate is unused and should be removed to avoid confusion. The test results confirm that the implementation works as expected.",
