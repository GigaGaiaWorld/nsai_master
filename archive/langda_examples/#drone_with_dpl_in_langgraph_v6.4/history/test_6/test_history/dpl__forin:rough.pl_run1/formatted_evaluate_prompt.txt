System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>% Insertion sort implementation in ProbLog

% Base case: inserting an element into an empty list
insert(X, [], [X]).

% Recursive case: inserting an element into a sorted list
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :- X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :- X > Y, insert(X, Ys, Zs).

% Base case: sorting an empty list
insertion_sort([], []).

% Recursive case: sorting a non-empty list
insertion_sort([X|Xs], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(Xs, SortedXs),
    insert(X, SortedXs, Sorted).

% Query example
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 501F546D </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The provided ProbLog code implements an insertion sort algorithm and appears to be syntactically correct. The test result confirms that the code correctly sorts the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating logical correctness for this specific case. However, further testing with edge cases (e.g., empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, or already sorted lists) is recommended to ensure robustness." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No errors were identified in the provided code or test results. The implementation meets the specified requirements for an interpretable `insertion_sort/2` algorithm." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "501F546D",
        "Report": "The code block is syntactically and logically correct. It implements the insertion sort algorithm as required, and the test result confirms its functionality. No issues were found."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Test the code with additional edge cases (e.g., empty lists, lists with duplicates, or already sorted lists) to ensure full coverage. 2. Consider adding comments to clarify the logic for future maintainability. 3. If the code is part of a larger ProbLog program, ensure it integrates seamlessly with other predicates and queries." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
