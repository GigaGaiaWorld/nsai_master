System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code is intended to solve the classic "zebra puzzle," which involves deducing the arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of clues. The code is mostly syntactically correct but appears incomplete, as indicated by the placeholder `<Langda>` and the requirement to "complete the rules." The test results indicate a timeout error, suggesting that the code may be stuck in an infinite loop or is too inefficient to complete within the allotted time. This could be due to missing constraints or incorrect logic in the rules.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Incomplete Code**: The `<Langda>` section is incomplete, and the requirement to "complete the rules" is not fulfilled.
2. **Timeout Error**: The code fails to execute within the expected time, likely due to inefficient or incorrect logic in the rules.
3. **Potential Infinite Loop**: The `next_to` and `right_of` predicates might not be properly constrained, leading to excessive backtracking.
4. **Missing Constraints**: Some clues from the puzzle may not be fully implemented, causing the solver to explore invalid solutions indefinitely.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "0F506A43",
        "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete. The line `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is a valid constraint but lacks context or additional rules to fully integrate it into the puzzle solution. This could lead to ambiguity or inefficiency in the solver."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Complete the Rules**: Ensure all clues from the zebra puzzle are fully implemented in the code. For example, add constraints for the remaining house attributes (e.g., colors, nationalities, pets, drinks, and cigarettes).
2. **Optimize Predicates**: Review the `next_to` and `right_of` predicates to ensure they are efficient and do not cause excessive backtracking. Consider adding additional constraints to limit the search space.
3. **Debugging**: Test the code incrementally by adding one constraint at a time to identify which rule might be causing the timeout.
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document each constraint to match the puzzle's clues, making it easier to verify correctness.
5. **Timeout Handling**: If the timeout persists, consider using a more efficient solver or breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
