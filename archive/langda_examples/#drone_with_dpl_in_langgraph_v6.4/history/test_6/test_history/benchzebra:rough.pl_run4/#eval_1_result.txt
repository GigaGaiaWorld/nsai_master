  "Report": "The code block `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is syntactically correct and implements a valid constraint from the zebra puzzle (the person who smokes Kools lives in the yellow house). However, the test results indicate a timeout error, which suggests that the overall puzzle solver is inefficient or incomplete. This specific block does not appear to be the root cause of the issue, as it is a straightforward constraint. The timeout is more likely due to missing or inefficiently implemented constraints elsewhere in the code (e.g., in the `next_to` or `right_of` predicates).",
