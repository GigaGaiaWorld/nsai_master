Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the completed code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code appears between two existing predicates and has a hash tag of 0F506A43. In the generated_code, the corresponding completed code is the line:

`my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),`

Here's the formatted JSON response:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```
