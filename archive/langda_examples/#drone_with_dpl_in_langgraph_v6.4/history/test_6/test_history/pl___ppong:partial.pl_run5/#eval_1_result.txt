{"HASH": "766936E0","Report": "The `team_strength` predicate for multiplayer teams correctly uses the `min` function to determine the team strength, aligning with the requirement. The code is syntactically correct and functionally sound. No regeneration is needed, but the implementation could be more explicit about the requirement for clarity.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

{"HASH": "2A6AD51D","Report": "The `wins` predicate correctly determines the winner based on team strength. The code is syntactically correct and functionally aligns with the requirement. No regeneration is needed, but the evidence provided in the test results does not fully validate the logic for all edge cases. Additional test cases would be beneficial.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
