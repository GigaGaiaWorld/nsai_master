Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> block in <origin_code>:

```problog
{
  "HASH": "501F546D",
  "Code": "% Corrected insertion sort implementation in ProbLog\n\n% Base case: an empty list is already sorted\ninsertion_sort([], []).\n\n% Recursive case: insert the head into the sorted tail\ninsertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-\n    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),\n    insert(H, SortedTail, Sorted).\n\n% Insert an element into a sorted list\ninsert(X, [], [X]).\ninsert(X, [Y|T], [X,Y|T]) :-\n    X =< Y.\ninsert(X, [Y|T], [Y|SortedT]) :-\n    X > Y,\n    insert(X, T, SortedT)."
}
```

Note that I've:
1. Used the same HASH value from the original code (501F546D)
2. Included the complete corrected implementation of the insertion sort algorithm
3. Maintained all comments and structure from the generated code
4. Formatted it in the requested JSON format with the "problog" language identifier
