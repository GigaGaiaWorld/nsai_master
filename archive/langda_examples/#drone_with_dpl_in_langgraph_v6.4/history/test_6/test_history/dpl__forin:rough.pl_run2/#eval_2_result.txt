Based on the provided analysis and evaluation instructions, here is the structured report for the given code block:

```report
{
    "HASH": "501F546D",
    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog. It includes proper base and recursive cases for sorting, and the insert/3 predicate correctly handles element insertion into sorted lists. The test result confirms the implementation works as expected, producing the correct sorted output [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] for input [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]. No syntax or logical errors were found, and the implementation fully meets the requirements.",
    "Need_regenerate": false,
