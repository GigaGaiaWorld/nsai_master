Here are the evaluations for each code block in JSON format:

```report
{
    "HASH": "12E8365D",
    "Report": "The implementation correctly defines team strength for a single-member team as the member's strength in the game. This perfectly matches the requirements and shows no logical or syntactic issues. The test results confirm it works as intended.",
    "Need_regenerate": false,
    "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "766936E0",
    "Report": "While functionally correct (using min() for team strength calculation matches requirements), the implementation could be improved for readability. The recursive approach works but could benefit from: 1) Adding clear documentation about the min() operation, 2) Potentially breaking into helper predicates. However, since it passes all tests and meets requirements, regeneration isn't strictly necessary.",
    "Need_regenerate": false,
    "Dependencies": ["12E8365D"]  # Depends on single-player version but that doesn't need regeneration
}
```

```report
{
    "HASH": "2A6AD51D",
    "Report": "The implementation is correct both syntactically and logically. It properly compares team strengths to determine the winner and handles the negation case correctly in the complementary rule. The test results show expected probabilistic behavior. No regeneration needed.",
    "Need_regenerate": false,
    "Dependencies": ["12E8365D", "766936E0"]  # Depends on team_strength implementations but neither needs regeneration
}
```

Key observations:
1. All code blocks implement their requirements correctly
2. No test failures or logical inconsistencies were found
3. The only suggested improvements are documentation/readability enhancements
4. No actual regeneration is required for any block
5. Dependencies exist but don't require regeneration cascades
