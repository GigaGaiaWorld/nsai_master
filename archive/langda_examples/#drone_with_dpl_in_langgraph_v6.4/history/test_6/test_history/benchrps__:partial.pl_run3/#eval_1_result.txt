Here are the structured reports for each code block that needs evaluation:

```report
{"HASH": "0C388A60", "Report": "The code block defines 'move(paper).' correctly. It implements the requirement of defining the 'paper' move and integrates well with other code blocks. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Report": "The code block defines 'move(scissor).' but 'scissor' should be spelled as 'scissors' for consistency with common terminology. This minor issue could cause confusion but does not affect functionality.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["58D60F5E"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "59C3D0D4", "Report": "The code block defines 'beats(paper, rock).' correctly. It implements the win-lose relationship for 'paper' and integrates well with other code blocks. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E", "Report": "The code block defines 'beats(scissor, paper).' but 'scissor' should be spelled as 'scissors' for consistency. This minor issue could cause confusion but does not affect functionality.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["BF964057"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "94C4D48B", "Report": "The code block defines the 'compute_score' rule for the 'lose' case correctly. It implements the scoring logic as required and integrates well with other code blocks. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "026B015E", "Report": "The code block defines the 'compute_score' rule for the 'draw' case correctly. It implements the scoring logic as required and integrates well with other code blocks. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```
