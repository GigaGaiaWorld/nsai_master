  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains syntax errors, such as missing commas and closing parentheses in the `zebra` predicate. Additionally, the logical structure is flawed, as the `houses` predicate is not properly integrated, leading to potential infinite loops or inefficiencies. The timeout error during testing confirms these issues. The block needs regeneration to fix syntax, optimize logic, and ensure proper integration with other predicates.",
