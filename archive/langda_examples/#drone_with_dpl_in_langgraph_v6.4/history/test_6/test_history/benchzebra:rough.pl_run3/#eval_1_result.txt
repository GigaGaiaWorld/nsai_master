  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and lacks proper termination, which causes a syntax error. Additionally, the constraints in the `zebra` predicate may not be sufficient to resolve the puzzle uniquely, leading to potential infinite loops or excessive backtracking. The test results indicate a timeout error, suggesting that the code is either too inefficient or enters an infinite loop. Recommendations include fixing the syntax, strengthening constraints, and optimizing the logic to prevent excessive backtracking.",
