Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in the original code:

```report
{"HASH": "0C388A60", "Report": "The code block defines the move 'paper' correctly. It implements the requirement 'move of paper' accurately and has no syntax or logical issues. It integrates well with other code blocks and the test result confirms its correctness.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Report": "The code block defines the move 'scissor', but there is a typo. The standard term is 'scissors', which would make the code more consistent with the game's terminology. This affects readability but not functionality, as the test result shows correct behavior. However, for consistency, regeneration is recommended.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["58D60F5E"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "59C3D0D4", "Report": "The code block correctly defines the win-lose relationship for 'paper' beating 'rock'. It meets the requirement 'Win-lose relationship of paper' and has no issues. The test result confirms its correctness.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E", "Report": "The code block defines the win-lose relationship for 'scissor' beating 'paper', but the move name should be corrected to 'scissors' for consistency. This is dependent on the correction of the move definition (HASH BF964057). Regeneration is recommended to maintain consistency.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["BF964057"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "94C4D48B", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the scoring logic for the 'lose' case, decrementing the score by 1. It meets the requirement 'rule of compute_score lose case' and has no issues. The test result confirms its correctness.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "026B015E", "Report": "The code block correctly implements the scoring logic for the 'draw' case, leaving the score unchanged. It meets the requirement 'rule of compute_score draw case'. While functionally correct, the predicate could be clarified for better readability (e.g., adding a comment). Regeneration is optional but not strictly necessary.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
