  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: 1. It calculates the length of the list (`Len`) to determine whether to continue splitting. 2. It includes a recursive boundary check (`Len > 1`). 3. It splits the list into `Left` and `Right` for recursive processing. However, the same logic is duplicated in the `split_list` predicate, which is redundant. The block does not need regeneration as it is functionally correct, but the redundancy should be addressed by removing the `split_list` predicate.",
