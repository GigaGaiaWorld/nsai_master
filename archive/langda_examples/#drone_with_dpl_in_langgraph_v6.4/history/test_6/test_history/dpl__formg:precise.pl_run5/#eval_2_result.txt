  "Report": "The `split_list` predicate is incorrectly implemented for merge sort. It splits the list into alternating elements ([H1|Left], [H2|Right]) rather than dividing it into two equal halves as required. This implementation will not produce correct merge sort results. Additionally, it fails to implement the required length check (Len) to determine if splitting should continue. The predicate needs complete regeneration to properly split lists into equal halves and incorporate length-based boundary checks.",

  "Report": "The main `merge_sort` predicate lacks proper boundary checks for lists of length â‰¤1 (required in the specifications) and incorrectly uses list splitting logic. While it correctly calls `merge` for combining sorted sublists, its recursive structure depends on a properly implemented `split_list` predicate. This block needs partial regeneration to: (1) Add explicit length checks (Len) for boundary conditions, (2) Properly integrate with the corrected `split_list` predicate, and (3) Maintain the correct merge operation flow.",
