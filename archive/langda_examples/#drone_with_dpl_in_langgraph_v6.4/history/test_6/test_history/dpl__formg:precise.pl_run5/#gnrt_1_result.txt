Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> section in origin_code was replaced by a more efficient implementation of split_list in the generated_code. Here's the formatted JSON for the corresponding code:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "split_list([H1, H2 | T], [H1 | Left], [H2 | Right]) :-\n    split_list(T, Left, Right).\nsplit_list([], [], []).\nsplit_list([X], [X], [])."}
```

This code block:
1. Replaces the original inefficient split_list implementation
2. Directly splits the list by taking alternate elements
3. Handles all three cases: empty list, single element list, and lists with two or more elements
4. Matches the HASH from the original <Langda> block (95E704F2)
