However, the `split_list` predicate is inefficient and could be simplified for better performance. The current implementation uses `length/2` and `append/3`, which are not optimal for splitting lists. A more efficient approach would be to directly split the list without unnecessary computations.",

The logic is sound and works as expected. No regeneration is needed for this block.",
