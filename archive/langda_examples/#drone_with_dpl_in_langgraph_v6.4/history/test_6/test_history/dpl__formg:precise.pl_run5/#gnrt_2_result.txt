Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks that correspond to the <langda> blocks:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2","Code": "length(List, Len),\n    Len > 1,\n    Half is Len // 2,\n    length(Left, Half),\n    append(Left, Right, List)"}
```

This is the only code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code, which was meant to replace the incorrect split_list implementation. The generated code properly implements the requirements of:
1. Getting the length of the current list (Len)
2. Including recursive boundary judgment (Len > 1)
3. Splitting the list into two parts (Left and Right) using length and append

The rest of the code in generated_code either wasn't part of the <langda> block or was already correct in the original code.
