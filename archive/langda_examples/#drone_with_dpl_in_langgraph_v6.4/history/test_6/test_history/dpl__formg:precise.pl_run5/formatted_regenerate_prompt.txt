System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Code>

merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>split_list([H1, H2 | T], [H1 | Left], [H2 | Right]) :-
    split_list(T, Left, Right).
split_list([], [], []).
split_list([X], [X], []).</Code_Block>
<Report>The `split_list` predicate is incorrectly implemented for merge sort. It splits the list into alternating elements ([H1|Left], [H2|Right]) rather than dividing it into two equal halves as required. This implementation will not produce correct merge sort results. Additionally, it fails to implement the required length check (Len) to determine if splitting should continue. The predicate needs complete regeneration to properly split lists into equal halves and incorporate length-based boundary checks.</Report>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 95E704F2 </HASH>
<Requirements>Should contain following rules: 1.Get the length of the current list, Len, to determine whether to continue splitting. 2.Recursive boundary judgment: Only lists with a length greater than 1 need to be sorted, otherwise they are sorted by default. 3.Split the list into two parts, Left and Right, for subsequent recursive processing. </Requirements></Langda>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
