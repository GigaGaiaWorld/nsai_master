System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DA97FB01 </HASH>
<Requirements>1.recursively sort the tail list, 2.insert the head element H into the sorted list </Requirements></Langda>
.
insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
 X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
 X > H,
 insert_element(X, T, RT).
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.
<original_code>

insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DA97FB01 </HASH>
<Requirements>1.recursively sort the tail list, 2.insert the head element H into the sorted list </Requirements></Langda>
.
insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
 X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
 X > H,
 insert_element(X, T, RT).
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The code is syntactically valid and implements the insertion sort algorithm correctly. The test result confirms that the code works as expected, producing the correct sorted list for the given input. However, there is a minor issue with the formatting of the code block in the input, which could lead to confusion." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No logical or runtime errors were identified in the code. The only issue is the formatting of the code block in the input, which includes an incomplete line (`insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-`) before the actual implementation." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "DA97FB01",
        "Report": "The code block is logically correct and fulfills the requirements of recursively sorting the tail list and inserting the head element into the sorted list. The test result confirms its correctness."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The incomplete line `insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-` in the input is misleading and should be removed to avoid confusion. The actual implementation follows correctly."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Remove the incomplete line `insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-` from the input to avoid confusion. 2. No further changes are required as the code is functionally correct and passes the test case." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
