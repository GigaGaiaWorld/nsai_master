  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is partially implemented but lacks the supporting predicates (`split_at_lowest_precedence/4` and `apply_operator/4`). The logic for parsing and evaluating expressions is incomplete, leading to the runtime error. The predicate assumes the existence of these helper predicates, which are critical for the recursive evaluation of expressions. The current implementation cannot function without these missing predicates, and the test failure confirms this issue.",
