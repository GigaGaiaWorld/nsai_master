Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<Langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "190031BC", "Code": "parse([N], N).\nparse([N, O | T], Result) :-\n  parse(T, R),\n  (O = '+', Result is N + R;\n   O = '-', Result is N - R;\n   O = '*', Result is N * R;\n   O = '/', R \\= 0, Result is N / R)."}
```

This JSON contains:
1. The original hash "190031BC" from the `<Langda>` block
2. The completed code that replaces the original `<Langda>` block, which now:
   - Uses comma-separated conditions instead of the `->` operator
   - Includes division by zero protection (`R \= 0`)
   - Maintains all required arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
   - Preserves the recursive structure for parsing expressions
