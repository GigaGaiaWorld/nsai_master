  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate and its helper predicates (`split_at_lowest_precedence/4`, `lowest_precedence_operator/1`, and `apply_operator/4`) are syntactically correct but logically flawed. The main issues are: 1) `split_at_lowest_precedence/4` does not correctly handle operator precedence, leading to incorrect parsing order (e.g., `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7` should be parsed as `(2 / 3) + (3 - (2 * 7))` but isn't); 2) The test result shows incorrect evaluation (0.0000), confirming the logical error; 3) The implementation doesn't fully integrate with `almost_equal/2` for floating-point comparisons. The code needs regeneration to fix operator precedence handling and ensure correct evaluation.",
