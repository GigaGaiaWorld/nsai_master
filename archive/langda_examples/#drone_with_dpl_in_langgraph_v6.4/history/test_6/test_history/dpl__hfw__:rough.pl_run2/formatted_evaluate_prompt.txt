</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code aims to implement a recursive expression evaluator in ProbLog, capable of parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions involving numbers and operators. The test results indicate a critical failure due to a missing predicate (`split_at_lowest_precedence/4`). The overall structure of the code is logically sound, but it lacks the implementation of key predicates required for parsing and evaluating expressions. The integration between the `detect_all/2` and `parse/2` predicates is conceptually correct, but the missing functionality prevents the code from executing successfully.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Missing Predicate**: The error message explicitly states that no clauses are found for `split_at_lowest_precedence/4`. This predicate is essential for splitting the list of symbols into left and right sub-expressions based on operator precedence, but it is not implemented.
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `parse/2` predicate relies on `split_at_lowest_precedence/4` and `apply_operator/4`, neither of which are defined in the provided code.
3. **Logical Gaps**: The code does not handle operator precedence or the actual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as required.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "190031BC",
        "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is partially implemented but lacks the supporting predicates (`split_at_lowest_precedence/4` and `apply_operator/4`). The logic for parsing and evaluating expressions is incomplete, leading to the runtime error. The predicate assumes the existence of these helper predicates, which are critical for the recursive evaluation of expressions."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Implement `split_at_lowest_precedence/4`**: Define this predicate to split the list of symbols into left and right sub-expressions based on the lowest precedence operator. This involves identifying the operator with the lowest precedence in the list and splitting the list around it.
2. **Implement `apply_operator/4`**: Define this predicate to perform the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on the operator symbol.
3. **Handle Operator Precedence**: Ensure that the `split_at_lowest_precedence/4` predicate correctly handles operator precedence (e.g., multiplication and division should have higher precedence than addition and subtraction).
4. **Test Incrementally**: After implementing the missing predicates, test the code with simpler expressions first to ensure correctness before scaling to more complex cases.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
