  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate uses the `->` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog, causing an 'UnknownClause' error. The predicate also lacks error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs. The logical structure is correct, but the implementation is incompatible with ProbLog's syntax. Recommendations: 1) Replace the `->` operator with nested `if-then-else` constructs or separate clauses for each arithmetic operation. 2) Add error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs. 3) Test the revised code thoroughly.",
