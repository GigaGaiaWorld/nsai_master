  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate correctly implements recursive evaluation of arithmetic expressions but has significant limitations. It evaluates expressions strictly left-to-right without considering operator precedence, which can lead to incorrect results for expressions like '2+3*4'. It also lacks proper error handling for division by zero cases, only performing a basic check without feedback. The predicate meets basic requirements for arithmetic operations but fails to handle more complex expressions correctly. The test case passes because it happens to work with left-to-right evaluation, but this is not robust behavior.",
