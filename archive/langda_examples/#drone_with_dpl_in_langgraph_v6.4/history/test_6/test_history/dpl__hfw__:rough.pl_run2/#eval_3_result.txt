  "HASH": "190031BC",
  "Report": "The code block with hash 190031BC contains the `parse/2` predicate and its helper predicates (`split_at_lowest_precedence/4`, `lowest_precedence_operator/1`, and `apply_operator/4`). The main issues are:\n1. **Operator Precedence**: The `lowest_precedence_operator/1` predicate only includes `+` and `-`, ignoring `*` and `/`, which should have higher precedence. This causes the expression to be split incorrectly.\n2. **Recursive Parsing**: The `split_at_lowest_precedence/4` predicate does not correctly handle nested expressions, leading to incorrect evaluation.\n3. **Division Handling**: The `apply_operator/4` predicate checks for division by zero, but the overall logic fails to evaluate the expression correctly.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Update `lowest_precedence_operator/1` to include all operators with correct precedence.\n2. Revise `split_at_lowest_precedence/4` to handle nested expressions properly.\n3. Add debugging to trace the evaluation flow.\n4. Test intermediate steps to ensure correct symbol detection and parsing.",
