{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: it checks the length of the list (`Len > 1`) and splits the list into `Left` and `Right` for recursive processing. However, the `split_list` predicate is flawed. It uses `length(Left, Half)` and `append(Left, Right, List)`, which may not correctly split the list unless `Left` is explicitly constructed. This could lead to incorrect splits for certain inputs.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Report": "This code block correctly implements the recursive merge sort logic: it sorts the left and right halves (`merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft)` and `merge_sort(Right, SortedRight)`) and merges them (`merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)`). The merging logic is also correctly implemented in the `merge` predicates. No issues are identified here.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
