  "HASH": "95E704F2",
  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: it calculates the length of the list (`Len`), checks if the length is greater than 1 (recursive boundary judgment), and splits the list into two parts (`Left` and `Right`). The logic is syntactically and semantically correct, and the test case confirms it works as expected. However, the `split_list` predicate could be improved for clarity by explicitly handling odd-length lists, though this is not a critical issue. No regeneration is strictly necessary, but minor refactoring could enhance readability.",

```report
{
  "HASH": "N/A (for merge predicate)",
  "Report": "The `merge` predicate is logically correct but could be optimized for readability by combining the two cases into a single rule with a disjunction (e.g., `H1 =< H2 ; H1 > H2`). This is a stylistic improvement and not a functional requirement. No regeneration is required unless readability is a priority.",

```report
{
  "HASH": "N/A (for append predicate)",
  "Report": "The `append` predicate is redundant as it duplicates built-in ProbLog functionality. Its inclusion does not cause errors but is unnecessary. Regeneration is recommended to remove this redundant code block.",
