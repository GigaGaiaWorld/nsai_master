Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code is replaced by the following code in generated_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2", "Code": "length(List, Len),\n    Len > 1,\n    split_list(List, Left, Right)"}
```

This is the only code block that directly corresponds to a <Langda> section in the origin_code. The rest of the generated code either was already present in the origin_code or doesn't correspond to any marked <Langda> block.

Note that while the generated_code contains improvements to the split_list predicate (replacing it with split_at), this wasn't marked as a <Langda> block in the origin_code, so I haven't included it in the extracted blocks.
