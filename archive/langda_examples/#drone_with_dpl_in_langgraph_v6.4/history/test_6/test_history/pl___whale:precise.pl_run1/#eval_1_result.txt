  "Report": "The `abandon/2` predicate is partially implemented. The requirements state that abandonment occurs when the adult sperm whale (ID 2) is of gender S, the orca (ID 3) is of gender O, and the adult sperm whale is at position c. The current implementation only checks the position (`position(2,c)`), missing the gender conditions. This could lead to incorrect or incomplete results if the genders are not properly accounted for. The predicate should be regenerated to include all specified conditions.",
