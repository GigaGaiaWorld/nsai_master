Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the completed code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code.

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)."}
```

This is the only code block that was completed in the generated_code that corresponds to a <Langda> block in the origin_code. The completed implementation now properly includes all the required conditions: checking the gender of the adult sperm whale (gender(2,S)), the gender of the orca (gender(3,O)), and the position of the adult sperm whale (position(2,c)).
