  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and contains critical errors, particularly in the `sumdigit` predicate where the `is/2` predicate is used incorrectly with non-ground arguments. This leads to a `CallModeError`. Additionally, the `query_sum` predicate lacks necessary constraints to ensure the sum `SEND + MORE = MONEY` and proper digit uniqueness. The code block needs to be regenerated to fix these issues, including proper handling of arithmetic operations and completion of the cryptarithmetic logic.",
