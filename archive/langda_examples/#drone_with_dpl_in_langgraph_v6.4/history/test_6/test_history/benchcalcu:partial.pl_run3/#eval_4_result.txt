  "Report": "The code block contains critical issues in the `sumdigit` predicate implementation. The main problems are: 1) Attempting arithmetic operations with uninstantiated variables, violating ProbLog's ground term requirement for `is/2` operations. 2) Incorrect carry-over logic in the summation. 3) Incomplete integration with the digit uniqueness constraints. The test results show a clear `CallModeError` due to these issues. The block needs complete regeneration to properly implement the cryptarithmetic logic with correct variable instantiation order and arithmetic operations.",
