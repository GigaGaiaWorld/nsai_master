    "Report": "The code block correctly implements the recursive sorting of the tail list and the insertion of the head element into the sorted list. The logic is sound, and the test result validates its correctness. The implementation fully meets the specified requirements (recursively sort the tail list and insert the head element H into the sorted list). No issues were identified in syntax, logic, or integration with other code blocks.",
