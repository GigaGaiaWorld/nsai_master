Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> section in origin_code was about the sumdigit constraint for the thousands digit calculation, which was redundant in the original code but properly implemented in the generated_code.

Here's the extracted code block in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This corresponds to:
1. The HASH tag from the original <Langda> section (4623869C)
2. The corrected implementation of the thousands digit calculation in the generated_code, which properly enforces the constraint S + M + C3 = O with carry result limited to M
