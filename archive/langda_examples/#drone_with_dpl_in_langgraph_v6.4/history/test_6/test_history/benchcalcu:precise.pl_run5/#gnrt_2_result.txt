Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> section in origin_code had:
- A code block: `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)`
- A hash: `4623869C`
- This was the only code block in the <Langda> section

In the generated_code, this appears exactly once (the redundancy was removed), so the extracted block is:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```
