  "Report": "The code block under this hash is intended to enforce the constraint `S + M + C3 = O` with the carry result limited to `M`. However, the implementation is redundant (called twice) and lacks clarity in enforcing the constraint. The `<Langda>` block is also syntactically invalid and should be removed or replaced with proper ProbLog comments. The block needs regeneration to ensure it correctly implements the requirement and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the code.",
