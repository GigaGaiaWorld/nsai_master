Here is the structured evaluation for each code block:

```report
{"HASH": "AFCFFD3D","Report": "The `sumdigit(0, D, E, Y, C1)` predicate is logically correct but redundant as it is repeated later in the code. No regeneration is needed for functionality, but optimization is recommended to remove redundancy.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BA7F9BE8","Report": "The `digit(N), all_different([N,Y,E,D])` predicate correctly implements the requirements but has redundant `all_different` checks. Regeneration is not strictly necessary, but consolidation of constraints would improve clarity.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "3E567069","Report": "The `digit(R), all_different([R,N,Y,E,D])` predicate is correct but suffers from the same redundancy issue as other `all_different` checks. No regeneration is needed, but optimization is advised.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0BCA612F","Report": "The `sumdigit(C1, N, R, E, C2)` predicate is correct and implements the requirements without issues. No regeneration is needed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "710BBD98","Report": "The `digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D])` predicate is correct but includes redundant uniqueness checks. Regeneration is not required, but consolidation with other constraints would be beneficial.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58F57C1C","Report": "The `sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3)` predicate is correct and meets the requirements. No regeneration is needed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "70805326","Report": "The `leftdigit(S), all_different([S,O,R,N,Y,E,D])` predicate is logically sound but could be merged with other uniqueness checks. Regeneration is not necessary, but optimization is recommended.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "72F32859","Report": "The `leftdigit(M), all_different([M,S,O,R,N,Y,E,D])` predicate is correct but shares redundancy issues with other `all_different` checks. No regeneration is needed, but consolidation would improve the code.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "4623869C","Report": "The `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` predicate is repeated twice, which is unnecessary. Regeneration is recommended to remove the redundancy and ensure clarity.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

### Summary:
- Only the code block with hash `4623869C` needs regeneration due to redundancy.
- All other blocks are functionally correct but could benefit from optimization to consolidate constraints and remove redundancy.
- No dependencies between blocks require regeneration.
