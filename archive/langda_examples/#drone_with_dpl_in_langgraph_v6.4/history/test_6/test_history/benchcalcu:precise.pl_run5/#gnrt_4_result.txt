Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code. Here's the JSON formatted result:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C","Code": "% Calculate the thousands digit S + M + C3 = O, and limit the carry result to M\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This corresponds to:
1. The original <Langda> block with hash "4623869C"
2. The completed code in generated_code that replaced it (the sumdigit call with a proper comment)
3. The requirements were to calculate S + M + C3 = O with carry result limited to M, which is exactly what this code does
