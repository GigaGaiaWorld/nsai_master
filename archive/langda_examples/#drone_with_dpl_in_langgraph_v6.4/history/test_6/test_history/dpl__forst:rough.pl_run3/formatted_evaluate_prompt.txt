System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The test results show that these operations work as expected, with all queries returning the correct output with a probability of 1.0000. However, the `sort` operation is not tested, and its implementation is incomplete (missing the `insertion_sort` predicate). The overall quality of the tested operations is high, but the untested `sort` operation raises concerns about its correctness and completeness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Missing Predicate**: The `sort` operation relies on an undefined `insertion_sort` predicate, which is not provided in the code.
2. **Untested Functionality**: The `sort` operation is not included in the test cases, leaving its correctness unverified.
3. **Potential Logical Issues**: The `get_top_n` predicate in the `sort` operation assumes the stack has at least `N` elements, but no checks are in place to handle cases where this is not true.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "5E40E418",
        "Report": "The first code block defines basic stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) correctly. The test results confirm that these operations work as intended. No syntax or logical errors are present in this block."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (second block lacks a hash)",
        "Report": "The second code block introduces a `sort` operation and a helper predicate `get_top_n`. The `sort` operation is incomplete due to the missing `insertion_sort` predicate. Additionally, the `get_top_n` predicate does not handle cases where the stack has fewer than `N` elements, which could lead to runtime errors."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Implement `insertion_sort`**: Define the `insertion_sort` predicate to complete the `sort` operation.
2. **Add Test Cases for `sort`**: Include test cases for the `sort` operation to verify its correctness.
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Modify `get_top_n` to handle stacks with fewer than `N` elements, possibly by returning an error or a default value.
4. **Document Assumptions**: Clearly document any assumptions about stack size or input validity to avoid misuse.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
