Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> block in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "592D75CA", "Code": "% Helper predicate to find an empty door that is neither selected nor the prize\nget_empty_door(Selected, PrizeDoor, EmptyDoor) :-\n    member(EmptyDoor, [1,2,3]),\n    EmptyDoor \\= Selected,\n    EmptyDoor \\= PrizeDoor."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "592D75CA", "Code": "% Predicate to open a door based on the Monty Hall rules\nopen_door(Door) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    prize(PrizeDoor),\n    % Case 1: Random door opening (50% probability)\n    (   Selected \\= PrizeDoor,\n        PrizeDoor \\= Door,\n        get_empty_door(Selected, PrizeDoor, OtherDoor),\n        0.5::open_door(Door) ; 0.5::open_door(OtherDoor)\n    ) ;\n    % Case 2: Deterministic door opening (host must open the empty door)\n    (   Selected \\= PrizeDoor,\n        PrizeDoor = Door,\n        get_empty_door(Selected, PrizeDoor, EmptyDoor),\n        open_door(EmptyDoor)\n    )."}
```

Note that both code blocks share the same HASH value since they both address the requirements specified in the original <langda> block. The first block is the helper predicate that was added to support the implementation, and the second block is the corrected version of the open_door/1 predicate.
