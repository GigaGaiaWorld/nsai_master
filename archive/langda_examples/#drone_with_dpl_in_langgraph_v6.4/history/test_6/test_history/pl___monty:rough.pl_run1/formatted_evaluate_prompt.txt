<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The provided ProbLog code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem but fails to execute due to missing definitions and logical inconsistencies. The test results indicate an error related to the undefined predicate `open_door/1`, which is critical for the problem's logic. The code also lacks proper implementation of the host's behavior as specified in the requirements.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Undefined Predicate**: The predicate `open_door/1` is referenced in the `win_switch` rule but is not defined anywhere in the code, leading to a runtime error.
2. **Incomplete Logic**: The helper predicate `get_empty_door/3` is defined but not integrated into the main logic to simulate the host's behavior (random or deterministic door opening).
3. **Missing Requirements**: The requirements specify two scenarios for the host's behavior (random and deterministic), but neither is implemented in the code.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "592D75CA",
        "Report": "The helper predicate `get_empty_door/3` is correctly implemented to find an empty door that is neither the selected nor the prize door. However, it is not used in the main logic to simulate the host's behavior. This predicate should be integrated into the `open_door/1` predicate to fulfill the requirements."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (Main Code Block)",
        "Report": "The main code block lacks the definition of `open_door/1`, which is essential for the Monty Hall problem. Additionally, the `win_switch` rule incorrectly assumes `open_door/1` is defined. The requirements for the host's behavior (random or deterministic door opening) are not implemented."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Define `open_door/1`**: Implement the `open_door/1` predicate to simulate the host's behavior. Use the `get_empty_door/3` helper to determine the empty door(s) and apply the rules for random or deterministic opening.
2. **Integrate Host Logic**: Modify the code to handle both scenarios:
   - **Random Opening**: When two empty doors remain, the host should randomly open one with a 50% probability.
   - **Deterministic Opening**: When one empty and one prize door remain, the host must open the empty door.
3. **Test the Implementation**: After defining `open_door/1`, test the code to ensure it behaves as expected in both scenarios.
4. **Document the Logic**: Add comments to clarify the host's behavior and how the predicates interact.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
