  "Report": "The helper predicate `get_empty_door/3` is correctly implemented to find an empty door that is neither the selected nor the prize door. However, it is not used in the main logic to simulate the host's behavior. This predicate should be integrated into the `open_door/1` predicate to fulfill the requirements. While the predicate itself is syntactically and logically correct, it needs to be properly utilized in the broader context of the program.",

  "Report": "The main code block lacks the definition of `open_door/1`, which is essential for the Monty Hall problem. Additionally, the `win_switch` rule incorrectly assumes `open_door/1` is defined. The requirements for the host's behavior (random or deterministic door opening) are not implemented. This block needs regeneration to include the missing predicate and properly integrate the host's behavior logic, possibly using the `get_empty_door/3` helper.",
