System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The `get_empty_door/3` predicate is correctly implemented to find an empty door that is neither the selected nor the prize door. However, it is not used in the main logic to determine which door the host opens. This predicate should be integrated into the `open_door/1` predicate to ensure the host's behavior aligns with the problem's rules. While the predicate itself is syntactically correct and functional, its lack of integration into the broader logic means it does not fulfill its intended purpose. Therefore, it needs to be regenerated with proper integration into the `open_door/1` predicate.</Report>

<Requirements>Define open_door/1 Predicate: Random Door Opening Rules Scenario: The remaining two doors are neither selected by the player nor have any prizes. Behavior: The host randomly opens one of the two "empty doors" with a 50% probability. Deterministic Door Opening Rules Scenario: The remaining two doors are neither selected by the player, one of which has a prize and the other does not. Behavior: The host must open the "empty door". </Requirements></Langda>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
