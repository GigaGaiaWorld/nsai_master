  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has significant issues that require regeneration. Key problems include: 1) Invalid syntax with improper use of `->` operator in ProbLog context, 2) Failure to properly implement the 50% probability requirement for random door opening, 3) Incomplete handling of deterministic case where host must open the empty door, 4) Structural issues that prevent proper integration with other predicates. The test failure confirms these implementation flaws. The predicate needs complete rewriting using proper ProbLog probabilistic syntax and clearer separation of the two required behaviors.",
