  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has significant issues:\n1. **Syntax Error**: The use of `->` (implication) is incorrect and violates ProbLog syntax rules. The predicate lacks proper structure for conditional logic.\n2. **Logical Error**: The implementation does not correctly separate the random (50% probability) and deterministic (host must open empty door) cases as required. The logic for selecting `OtherDoor` is ambiguous.\n3. **Variable Instantiation**: The `OtherDoor` variable is not properly defined or instantiated, leading to runtime errors.\n4. **Test Failure**: The error message indicates an 'Unknown Clause' due to the malformed predicate definition.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Restructure the predicate to use valid ProbLog syntax without `->`.\n- Clearly define the random and deterministic cases with proper probability annotations.\n- Instantiate `OtherDoor` by explicitly listing possible doors and filtering based on conditions.\n- Add helper predicates to identify empty doors for clarity.",
