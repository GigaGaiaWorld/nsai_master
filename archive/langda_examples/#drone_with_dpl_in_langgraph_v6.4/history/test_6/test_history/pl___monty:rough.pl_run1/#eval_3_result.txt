  "Report": "The `get_empty_door/3` predicate is correctly implemented to find an empty door that is neither the selected nor the prize door. However, it is not used in the main logic to determine which door the host opens. This predicate should be integrated into the `open_door/1` predicate to ensure the host's behavior aligns with the problem's rules. While the predicate itself is syntactically correct and functional, its lack of integration into the broader logic means it does not fulfill its intended purpose. Therefore, it needs to be regenerated with proper integration into the `open_door/1` predicate.",

  "Report": "The main code block defines the prize distribution and player's selection but lacks the implementation of the `open_door/1` predicate. This predicate is crucial for modeling the host's behavior, which involves opening a door based on the player's selection and the prize location. The absence of this predicate causes the runtime error. The main code block needs to be regenerated to include the `open_door/1` predicate, which should use the `get_empty_door/3` helper to enforce the host's rules (random or deterministic opening).",
