Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code was:
```prolog
sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)
```

And in the generated_code, this has been simplified to a single call (removing the redundant duplicate call). Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```

This matches:
1. The HASH tag from the original <Langda> block
2. The corrected code from the generated_code (with the redundant call removed)
3. The requirement to calculate the thousands digit S + M + C3 = O with carry result M
