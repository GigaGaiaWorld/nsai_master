  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks the full implementation of the `query_sum` predicate. Specifically, it does not enforce the uniqueness of digits `S`, `E`, `N`, `D`, `M`, `O`, `R`, and `Y` in the final constraint. Additionally, the `sumdigit` calls do not correctly propagate the carry values, leading to incorrect addition results. The test result shows a probability of 0.0000, indicating no valid solution was found due to these issues.",
