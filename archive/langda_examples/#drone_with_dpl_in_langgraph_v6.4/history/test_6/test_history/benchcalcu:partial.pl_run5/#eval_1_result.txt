  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and contains syntax errors (missing closing parenthesis and comma after `sumdigit(C1, N, R, E, C2)`). It also fails to properly enforce uniqueness constraints (`all_different`) across all variables. The logical flow for the cryptarithmetic puzzle is broken due to these issues, leading to the test failure (probability 0.0000).",

```report
{
  "HASH": "N/A (second block)",
  "Report": "The second block contains the `sumdigit` predicate, which incorrectly implements carry-over logic for cryptarithmetic puzzles. The constraints (`all_different`) are not consistently enforced, and the predicate definitions do not align with the puzzle's requirements. This contributes to the test failure and requires regeneration to fix the logic and constraints.",
