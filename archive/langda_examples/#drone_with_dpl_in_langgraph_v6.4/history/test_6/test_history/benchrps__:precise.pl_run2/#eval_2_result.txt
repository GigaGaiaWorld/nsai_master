  "Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate is correctly implemented and meets all requirements. It checks for equal list lengths, processes moves via `play/3`, computes the score with `compute_score/2`, and determines the winner based on the score. The test result confirms its correctness. No logical or syntactic issues were found. Minor stylistic improvements could be made (e.g., removing redundant comments), but regeneration is not necessary as the core functionality is sound.",
