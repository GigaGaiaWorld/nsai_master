  "Report": "The `addition` predicate in the `<Code_Block>` is correctly implemented and matches the requirements (addition logic with input as img_1 to img_0). The logic works as evidenced by the successful test result (addition(img_5,img_6,11)). However, the original code block is incomplete (missing closing period) and the `<Langda>` wrapper is unnecessary. The main issues are structural/syntactical in the overall file rather than in this specific code block's logic.",
