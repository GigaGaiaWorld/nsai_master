  "Report": "The code block correctly implements basic stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`), as confirmed by the test results. However, it has the following issues: 1) The `sort` operation is incomplete due to the missing `insertion_sort` predicate. 2) Edge cases (e.g., empty stacks or stacks with insufficient elements for operations like `swap`, `over`, and `rot`) are not handled. 3) The `sort` operation is untested. Recommendations: 1) Implement `insertion_sort` to complete the `sort` operation. 2) Add tests for `sort` and edge cases. 3) Document assumptions about stack size requirements.",
