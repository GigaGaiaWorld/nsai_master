Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block corresponding to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{
  "HASH": "5E40E418",
  "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).\nstack_op(pop, [X|Stack], Stack).\nstack_op(dup, [X|Stack], [X,X|Stack]).\nstack_op(swap, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X|Stack]).\nstack_op(over, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X,Y|Stack]).\nstack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Stack], [Y,Z,X|Stack])."
}
```

Note: The generated_code section didn't contain any additional code beyond what was already present in the origin_code's <langda> block, so I've extracted and formatted only that one code block with its corresponding hash.
