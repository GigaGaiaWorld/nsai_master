Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),
    Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _,_],
    Houses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)|_],
    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,chesterfields), house(_,_,fox,_,_), Houses),
    next_to(house(_,_,_,_,kools), house(_,_,horse,_,_), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),
    next_to(house(_,norwegian,_,_,_), house(blue,_,_,_,_), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)."}
```

Note that this is the exact same code block that was in the <langda> section of the origin_code, as the generated_code didn't actually add any new constraints or modifications to this particular block - it just incorporated it into the complete predicate definition. The generated_code maintained all the same constraints that were present in the original <langda> block.
