  "Report": "The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the test case, but it has several issues: (1) The `split/3` predicate is inefficient due to its use of `length/2` and `append/3` for list splitting, which is not optimal for large lists. (2) The code does not leverage ProbLog's probabilistic features, missing an opportunity for interpretability or uncertainty handling. (3) The `append/3` predicate is redundantly defined elsewhere in the code. Recommendations: Optimize `split/3`, integrate ProbLog features, and remove redundant code.",

  "Report": "The standalone `append/3` definition outside the main code block is redundant and should be removed to avoid confusion. The `query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))` is not properly integrated into the ProbLog model and should either be removed or formatted as a ProbLog query. This block does not require regeneration but should be cleaned up.",
