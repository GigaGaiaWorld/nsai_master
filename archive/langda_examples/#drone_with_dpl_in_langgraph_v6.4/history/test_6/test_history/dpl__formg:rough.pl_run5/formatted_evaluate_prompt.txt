System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Result> Here are the testing result of code:

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test results confirm that it correctly sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the given requirements. However, there are minor issues related to code organization and potential inefficiencies in the auxiliary predicates.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Code Organization**: The `append/3` predicate is included but unused in the main logic of the merge sort. This could lead to confusion or unintended side effects if the code is extended.
2. **Redundancy**: The `split/3` predicate includes a redundant clause for `split([X], [X], [])`, which is already covered by the base case `split([], [], [])` and the recursive case.
3. **Potential Inefficiency**: The `merge/3` predicate could be optimized further to avoid redundant comparisons.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "418D2062",
        "Report": "The merge sort implementation is correct and interpretable. The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` work together as expected. However, the `split/3` predicate includes a redundant clause for single-element lists, which is unnecessary. The `merge/3` predicate could also be optimized to reduce redundant comparisons."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `append/3` predicate is included but not used in the merge sort logic. This could be removed to avoid confusion."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Remove Unused Code**: Eliminate the `append/3` predicate since it is not used in the merge sort implementation.
2. **Optimize `split/3`**: Remove the redundant clause `split([X], [X], [])` as it is already handled by the base and recursive cases.
3. **Optimize `merge/3`**: Consider reordering the conditions in the `merge/3` predicate to minimize redundant comparisons.
4. **Add Comments**: Include comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate and its role in the merge sort algorithm for better interpretability.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
