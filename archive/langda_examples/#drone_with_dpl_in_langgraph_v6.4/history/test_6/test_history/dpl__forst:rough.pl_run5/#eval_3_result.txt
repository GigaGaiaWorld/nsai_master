{"HASH": "5E40E418","Report": "The code block implements basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) correctly. Test results confirm these operations work as expected. The syntax is valid, and the logic aligns with the requirements. No issues were found in this block.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "N/A (sort operation)","Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete and untested. Missing predicates (`get_top_n` and `insertion_sort`) are required for it to function. This block needs regeneration to implement these predicates and include test cases for verification.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
