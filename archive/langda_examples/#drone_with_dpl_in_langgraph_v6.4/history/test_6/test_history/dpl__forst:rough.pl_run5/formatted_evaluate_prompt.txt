System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],[1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000

stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 3, 1, 4]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The codebase implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, and the test results indicate that the basic operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) are functioning correctly. However, the `sort` operation is not tested, and its implementation is incomplete, which could lead to issues. The overall quality of the code is good for the tested operations, but the untested `sort` operation requires further attention." </Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> "The primary issue is the incomplete implementation of the `sort` operation. The `get_top_n` and `insertion_sort` predicates are not provided, which means the `sort` operation will fail. Additionally, the `sort` operation is not included in the test cases, leaving its functionality unverified." </Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "5E40E418",
        "Report": "The code block implements the basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) correctly. The test results confirm that these operations work as expected. The syntax is valid, and the logic aligns with the requirements."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (sort operation)",
        "Report": "The `sort` operation is incomplete. The predicates `get_top_n` and `insertion_sort` are missing, which are required for the `sort` operation to function. Without these, the `sort` operation will fail. Additionally, the `sort` operation is not tested, leaving its functionality unverified."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>"1. Implement the missing predicates (`get_top_n` and `insertion_sort`) for the `sort` operation. 2. Add test cases for the `sort` operation to verify its functionality. 3. Ensure all predicates are properly integrated and tested to avoid runtime errors." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
