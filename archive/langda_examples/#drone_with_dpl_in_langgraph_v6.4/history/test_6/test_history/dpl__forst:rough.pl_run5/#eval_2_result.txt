  "Report": "The code block correctly implements basic stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`), as confirmed by the test results. However, it includes an incomplete `sort` operation due to the missing `insertion_sort` predicate. The `get_top_n` predicate also lacks error handling for cases where the stack has fewer than `N` elements. While the existing operations are correct, the incomplete and untested `sort` functionality requires attention.",
