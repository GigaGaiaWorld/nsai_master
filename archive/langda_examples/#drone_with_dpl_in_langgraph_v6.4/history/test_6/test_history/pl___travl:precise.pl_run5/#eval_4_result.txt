  "Report": "The code block introduces predicates (`inf_initial/1`, `inf_contact/1`, `inf_travel/1`) that are not defined, leading to a runtime error. The logic for combining probabilities is incomplete and does not correctly link to the original predicates (`initialInf`, `contact`, `riskyTravel`). The requirements specify distinct probabilities for different infection sources, but the implementation fails to properly model these. The block needs regeneration to define the intermediate predicates and ensure logical consistency with the original predicates.",
