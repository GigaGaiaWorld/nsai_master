  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate logic is correctly implemented syntactically and aligns with the specified requirements. However, the test results show unexpectedly low probabilities (0.0316 for both `inf(a)` and `inf(b)`), indicating a problem with probability combination. The current implementation treats infection sources (initial infection, contact transmission, and travel risk) as independent events rather than combining them additively or multiplicatively as intended. This results in underestimation of the true infection risk.",
