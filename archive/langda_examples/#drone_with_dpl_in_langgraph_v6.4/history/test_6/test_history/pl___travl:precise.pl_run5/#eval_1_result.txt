  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate currently only checks for `initialInf/1`, which is insufficient. It should also include logic for contact transmission and travel risk as specified in the requirements. The test results confirm this deficiency, showing only the initial infection probabilities (0.1) without accounting for contact transmission or travel risk. The predicate needs to be regenerated to incorporate these additional factors.",
