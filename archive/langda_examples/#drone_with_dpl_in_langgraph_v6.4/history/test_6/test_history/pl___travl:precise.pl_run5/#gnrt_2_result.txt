Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "% Regenerated inf/1 predicate\n% Initial infection\n0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).\n% Contact transmission\n0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X, Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).\n0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X, Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X).\n% Travel risk\n0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

Note that:
1. I've used the same HASH value (E09B4F54) from the original code block
2. The code includes all three parts of the regenerated inf/1 predicate (initial infection, contact transmission, and travel risk)
3. The formatting preserves the comments and structure of the generated code
4. The backslash in `\+susceptible(X)` has been properly escaped with an additional backslash for JSON compatibility
