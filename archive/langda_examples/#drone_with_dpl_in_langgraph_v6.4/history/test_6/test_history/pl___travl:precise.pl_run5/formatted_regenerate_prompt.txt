System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The code block introduces predicates (`inf_initial/1`, `inf_contact/1`, `inf_travel/1`) that are not defined, leading to a runtime error. The logic for combining probabilities is incomplete and does not correctly link to the original predicates (`initialInf`, `contact`, `riskyTravel`). The requirements specify distinct probabilities for different infection sources, but the implementation fails to properly model these. The block needs regeneration to define the intermediate predicates and ensure logical consistency with the original predicates.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
