Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks that correspond to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "06576BEB", "Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :-\n    digit(H, D),\n    number(T, N1),\n    N is N1 * 10 + D."}
```

This is the only code block that was missing in the origin_code (marked by <langda>) and was completed in the generated_code. The JSON includes the hash from the <Langda> information and the completed number predicate definition that converts a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values.
