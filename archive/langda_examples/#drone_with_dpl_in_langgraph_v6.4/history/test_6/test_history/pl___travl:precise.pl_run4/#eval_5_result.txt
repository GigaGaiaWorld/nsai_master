  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf(X)` predicate with four rules that correctly implement the specified requirements for initial infection, contact transmission (both susceptible and non-susceptible cases), and travel risk. However, the test results show probabilities (0.0316) that are significantly lower than expected (e.g., initial infection alone should be 0.1). This indicates a problem with how ProbLog aggregates the probabilities from multiple rules. The issue likely stems from the way independent probabilities are combined, and the current implementation does not correctly reflect the intended behavior. The `susceptible(X)` predicate's impact is also not clearly visible in the results.",
