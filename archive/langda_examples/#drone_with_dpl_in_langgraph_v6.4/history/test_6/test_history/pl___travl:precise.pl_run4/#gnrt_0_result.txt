Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks that correspond to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "inf(X) :- initialInf(X)."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \\+susceptible(X)."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X)."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "E09B4F54", "Code": "0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X)."}
```

These code blocks implement the infection logic as specified in the <Requirements> section of the <langda> block, using the same hash tag E09B4F54 for identification.
