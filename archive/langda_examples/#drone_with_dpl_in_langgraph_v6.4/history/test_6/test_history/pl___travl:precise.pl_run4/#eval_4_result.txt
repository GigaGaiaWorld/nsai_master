  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf(X)` predicate with four rules that correctly implement the specified requirements for initial infection, contact transmission (both susceptible and non-susceptible cases), and travel risk. However, the test results show probabilities (0.0316) that are significantly lower than expected, indicating an issue with probability aggregation. The current implementation treats each rule as an independent source of infection without combining their probabilities. This is a logical inconsistency that affects the correctness of the results. The code needs to be regenerated to properly aggregate probabilities from multiple infection sources.",
