  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate currently only implements the initial infection probability (0.1) via `initialInf/1`, but fails to incorporate the required contact transmission logic (0.6/0.8 probabilities) and travel risk (0.2 probability) as specified in the requirements. This results in incomplete probability calculations in the test output. The predicate needs to be extended to include these additional factors by: (1) Adding rules for contact-based transmission (conditional on `contact/2` and `susceptible/1`), (2) Adding the travel risk probability via `riskyTravel/1`, and (3) Combining all probabilities appropriately to reflect the total infection risk.",
