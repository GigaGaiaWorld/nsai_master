  "Report": "The code block defines the `inf/1` predicate with four rules that correctly implement the individual probabilities for initial infection, contact transmission (both susceptible and non-susceptible cases), and travel risk. However, the test results show significantly lower probabilities (0.0316) than expected, indicating a problem with how these probabilities are combined. The current implementation treats the rules as independent events, leading to underestimation of the overall infection probability. The rules should be restructured to properly aggregate probabilities from multiple infection sources (initial, contact, travel).",
