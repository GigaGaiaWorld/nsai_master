  "Report": "The `inf/1` rules are syntactically correct but fail to implement the required probability logic accurately. The main issues are: (1) Probabilities from different sources (initialInf, contact, riskyTravel) are not correctly aggregated, resulting in unexpectedly low test results (0.0316 vs expected higher values). (2) The `susceptible/1` predicate is not effectively used to differentiate infection probabilities during contact (0.6 vs 0.8 as specified). (3) The rules don't account for cumulative infection risks (e.g., initial infection + travel risk). Recommendations: (1) Revise probability aggregation using ProbLog's combination rules or explicit disjunction. (2) Clarify susceptible/non-susceptible differentiation in contact rules. (3) Add documentation for probability interactions.",
