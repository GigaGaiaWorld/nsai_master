{"HASH": "58D60F5E","Report": "The code block `beats(scissors, paper).` is syntactically correct and implements the required win-lose relationship for scissors. However, it depends on the predicate `beats(rock, scissor).` which contains a typo ('scissor' instead of 'scissors'). This inconsistency affects the game logic. The block itself does not need regeneration, but the dependent predicate `beats(rock, scissor).` must be corrected.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
