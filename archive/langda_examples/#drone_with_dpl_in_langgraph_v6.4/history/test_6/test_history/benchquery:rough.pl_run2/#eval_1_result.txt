  "Report": "The `density` predicate is syntactically incorrect and causes a grounding error in ProbLog due to improper formatting of the clause head. Additionally, it lacks the logic to compare densities or filter results as required by the task (finding countries with approximately equal population density within 5%). The predicate needs to be reformatted for ProbLog and should include proper arithmetic operations and comparisons.",
