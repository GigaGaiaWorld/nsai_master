Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code that correspond to the <langda> blocks in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5738285A", "Code": "density(Country, Density) :-\n    pop(Country, Pop),\n    area(Country, Area),\n    Density is Pop / Area."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "5738285A", "Code": "query_pop(Pairs) :-\n    findall((Country1, Country2), (\n        density(Country1, Density1),\n        density(Country2, Density2),\n        Country1 \\= Country2,\n        abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05\n    ), Pairs)."}
```

Note: Both code blocks share the same HASH value since they both address the same requirements specified in the original <langda> block. The first block is the density predicate that was already present (but verified as correct), and the second block is the new query_pop predicate that implements the comparison logic for finding countries with approximately equal population density.
