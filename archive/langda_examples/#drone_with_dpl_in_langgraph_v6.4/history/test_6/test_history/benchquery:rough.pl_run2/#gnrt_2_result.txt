Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` blocks in `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "5738285A", "Code": "density(Country, Density) :-\n    pop(Country, Pop),\n    area(Country, Area),\n    Density is Pop / Area."}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "5738285A", "Code": "query_pop(Country1, Country2) :-\n    density(Country1, Density1),\n    density(Country2, Density2),\n    Country1 \\= Country2,\n    abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05."}
```

Note: Both code blocks share the same HASH value since they both address the same original `<langda>` block's requirements (the density calculation and the query_pop implementation). The second code block (query_pop) was implicitly required by the original task's requirements even though it wasn't explicitly marked with a `<langda>` tag.
