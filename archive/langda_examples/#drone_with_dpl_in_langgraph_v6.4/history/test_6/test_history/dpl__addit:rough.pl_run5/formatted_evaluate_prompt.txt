System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>number([], 0).
number([H|T], N) :-
    digit(H, D),
    number(T, N1),
    N is N1 * 10 + D.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 06576BEB </HASH>
<Requirements>define number predicate, to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. </Requirements></Langda>
.
multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,X2),number(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],310) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The code is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements correctly. The test results confirm that the logic works as intended, converting lists of image IDs to their corresponding integer values and performing the addition correctly. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and potential improvements for clarity and robustness." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No critical errors were identified. The code functions as expected, but the following minor issues were noted:
1. The `digit` facts are not explicitly defined for all digits (e.g., `img_10` is missing, though not required here).
2. The `number` predicate does not handle edge cases like empty lists or invalid image IDs gracefully.
3. The `multi_addition` predicate name has a typo ('multi_addition' vs. 'multi_addition')." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "06576BEB",
        "Report": "The `number` predicate is correctly implemented to convert a list of image IDs to an integer. However, it lacks error handling for invalid image IDs or empty lists. The logic is sound, but edge cases could cause unexpected behavior."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `digit` facts are correctly defined for digits 0-9, but the code does not account for potential future extensions (e.g., more digits or invalid inputs). The `multi_addition` predicate has a typo in its name ('multi_addition' vs. 'multi_addition'). The logic for addition is correct, as confirmed by the test results."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Fix the typo in the `multi_addition` predicate name.
2. Add error handling in the `number` predicate for invalid image IDs or empty lists.
3. Consider extending the `digit` facts to cover all possible digits if the application scope expands.
4. Add comments to clarify the purpose of each predicate for better maintainability." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
