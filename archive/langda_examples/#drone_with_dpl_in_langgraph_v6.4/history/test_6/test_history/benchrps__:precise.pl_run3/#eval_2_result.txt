{"HASH": "FD850DEC","Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate for the `draw` case is correctly implemented. It adheres to the requirement that a draw does not affect the score by directly passing the previous round score `S1`. No logical or syntactic issues are present in this block.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "3FEB17D7","Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate is logically correct but suffers from minor syntactic issues due to misplaced commas and inconsistent formatting. The predicate correctly uses `play/3` and `compute_score/2` to determine the winner, but the implementation could be cleaner. The test result confirms its functionality, so regeneration is not strictly necessary. However, refactoring for readability is recommended.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
