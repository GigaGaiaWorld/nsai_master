<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The codebase implements a basic rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the outcome of each round and calculating the overall winner. The test result shows that the code correctly identifies the winner as `player2` for the given input, which aligns with the expected logic. However, there are minor syntactic and logical issues that need to be addressed to ensure robustness and correctness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **Syntax Issues**: 
   - The `result/3` predicate has incomplete clauses with misplaced line breaks and missing body conditions.
   - The `determine_winner/3` predicate has a misplaced comma and inconsistent formatting.
2. **Logical Issues**: 
   - The `result/3` predicate lacks proper conditions for `draw`, `win`, and `lose` cases, which could lead to incorrect results in edge cases.
3. **Integration Issues**: 
   - The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are correctly integrated, but the `result/3` predicate needs refinement to ensure accurate results.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "FD850DEC",
        "Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate for the `draw` case is correctly implemented, as it does not affect the score. However, the surrounding code (e.g., `result/3`) needs to ensure that `draw` cases are properly handled to avoid logical inconsistencies."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "3FEB17D7",
        "Report": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate is logically correct but suffers from syntactic issues due to misplaced commas and inconsistent formatting. The predicate correctly uses `play/3` and `compute_score/2` to determine the winner, but the implementation could be cleaner."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix Syntax**:
   - Ensure all predicates (`result/3`, `determine_winner/3`) are properly formatted with consistent line breaks and no misplaced commas.
2. **Refine Logic**:
   - Update the `result/3` predicate to explicitly handle `draw`, `win`, and `lose` cases with clear conditions.
3. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Test the code with edge cases (e.g., all draws, empty lists) to ensure robustness.
4. **Clean Up Code**:
   - Remove unnecessary comments and ensure the code is well-structured for readability.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
