  "Report": "The code block defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors (move/1 and beats/2) correctly and includes a compute_score/2 predicate that works as intended. However, it fails to implement the play/3 predicate, which is required to determine the outcome of each move in the sequences. This omission causes the runtime error when the determine_winner/3 predicate is called. The code also includes a query that tests the functionality but fails due to the missing play/3 predicate. The requirements are partially met, as the game rules are defined, but the game logic is incomplete.",
