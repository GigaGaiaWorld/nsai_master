  "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score/2` predicate, which recursively calculates the score based on a list of results (win, lose, or draw). This part of the code is syntactically correct and logically sound. However, it is not directly useful without the `play/3` predicate to generate the results list. The test failure is due to the missing `play/3` predicate, not this code block. Therefore, this block does not need regeneration, but it depends on the implementation of `play/3`.",
