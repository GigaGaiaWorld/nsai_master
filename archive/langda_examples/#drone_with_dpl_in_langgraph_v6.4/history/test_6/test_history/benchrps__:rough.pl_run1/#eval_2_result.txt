  "Report": "The code block defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors correctly (`move` and `beats` predicates). However, the `play` and `determine_winner` predicates are not properly formatted for ProbLog. The `play` predicate uses Prolog-style syntax (e.g., `->`), which is not directly compatible with ProbLog. Additionally, the `query` statement is not correctly formatted for ProbLog, leading to the 'UnknownClause' error. The code needs to be regenerated to use ProbLog-compatible syntax and ensure proper integration of all predicates.",
