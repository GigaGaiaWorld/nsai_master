System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The code block defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors correctly (`move` and `beats` predicates). However, the `play` and `determine_winner` predicates are not properly formatted for ProbLog. The `play` predicate uses Prolog-style syntax (e.g., `->`), which is not directly compatible with ProbLog. Additionally, the `query` statement is not correctly formatted for ProbLog, leading to the 'UnknownClause' error. The code needs to be regenerated to use ProbLog-compatible syntax and ensure proper integration of all predicates.</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
