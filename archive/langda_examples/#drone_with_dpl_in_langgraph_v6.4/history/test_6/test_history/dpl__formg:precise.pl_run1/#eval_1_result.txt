  "Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements by checking the list length and splitting it into two parts. However, the `split_list` predicate is inefficient and could be improved. The current implementation uses `length(Left, Half)` and `append(Left, Right, List)`, which is not optimal. A more efficient implementation would directly split the list without unnecessary length calculations and appends. Despite this inefficiency, the block functions correctly and meets all specified requirements.",

  "Report": "This code block correctly implements the recursive merge sort and merging of the sorted sublists. The logic is sound, and the test result confirms its correctness. The block fully meets the requirements, including recursively calling merge sort on the left and right halves and merging the results. No issues are identified, and regeneration is not necessary.",
