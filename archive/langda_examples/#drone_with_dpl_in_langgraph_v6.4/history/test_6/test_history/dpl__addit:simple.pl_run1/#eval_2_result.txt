  "Report": "The addition rule is logically correct and implements the required functionality, as evidenced by the successful test result. The code correctly retrieves numeric values from digit-labeled images and performs addition. The only issue is formatting - the rule appears on a separate line without proper indentation or separation from the digit facts. While this doesn't affect functionality, it impacts readability and maintainability.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

Reasoning:
1. The code block implements all requirements correctly (addition logic working with img_1 to img_0 inputs)
2. The test case shows correct functionality (addition(img_5,img_6,11) works)
3. While formatting could be improved, this doesn't require regeneration - it can be fixed with simple reformatting
4. There are no dependencies on other code blocks that need regeneration
5. No syntax or logical errors were found in the implementation

Recommendation: Instead of regenerating, the existing code should simply be reformatted for better readability by:
1. Adding proper indentation
2. Including blank lines between the digit facts and the addition rule
3. Potentially adding comments to explain the code structure
