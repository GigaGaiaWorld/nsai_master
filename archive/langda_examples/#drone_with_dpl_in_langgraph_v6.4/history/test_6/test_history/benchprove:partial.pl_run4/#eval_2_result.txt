  "Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` predicate is correctly implemented to satisfy the requirement `Y is X*2`. However, it lacks documentation or comments explaining its purpose, which could make it less maintainable. Additionally, the predicate assumes `X` is a number, but there is no error handling for non-numeric inputs. Despite these minor issues, the predicate functions as intended and passes all tests, so regeneration is not strictly necessary. Adding documentation and error handling would be improvements but do not require regeneration.",
