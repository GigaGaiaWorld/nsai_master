Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F69CE0F", "Code": "expand(double(X), Y) :- number(X), Y is X*2."}
```

This matches:
1. The HASH tag from the origin_code (0F69CE0F)
2. The completed code from generated_code which includes the suggested number(X) check
3. The Requirements from origin_code (Y is X*2) while adding the type check
