System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
% member/2 for ProbLog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
% --------- Basic meta-interpreter ---------
% Prove "true" always succeeds
prove(true).
prove(Goal) :-
	% For all other goals, use the clause/2 facts/rules defined in the program
	clause(Goal, Body),
	prove(Body).
% Prove compound goal A,B: prove A first, then prove B
prove((A,B)) :-
	prove(A),
	prove(B).
% --------- Extended logic processing ---------
prove(implies(P,Q)) :-
	
 (\+ prove(P); prove(Q)).
prove(opposite(P)) :-
	
 \+ prove(P).
prove(expand(A,B)) :-
	expand(A,B).
prove(includes(Set,X)) :-
	member(X,Set).
prove(extend(List,Elem,Extended)) :-
	
 Extended = [Elem|List].
prove(refute(P)) :-
	\+ prove(P).
% --------- Examples ---------- %
% Define some expand rules:
<Langda>

% --------- Queries ---------- %

query(prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))).
query(prove(expand(double(3),6))).
query(prove(includes([a,b,c],b))).
query(prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 1.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 1.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 1.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 1.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the most part. The test results indicate that all queries return the expected values (1.0000), suggesting that the implemented predicates and meta-interpreter are functioning as intended. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and potential improvements for clarity and robustness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Whitespace and Formatting**: The `prove(implies(P,Q))` and `prove(opposite(P))` predicates have unnecessary whitespace after the opening parenthesis, which, while not causing errors, could lead to readability issues.
2. **Redundancy**: The `prove(refute(P))` predicate is redundant as it is identical to `prove(opposite(P))`.
3. **Missing Documentation**: The `expand/2` predicate is defined inline without clear documentation or context, which could confuse users.
4. **Potential Overlap**: The `member/2` predicate is defined but not explicitly documented, which might lead to misuse or confusion.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "0F69CE0F",
        "Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` predicate is correctly implemented to satisfy the requirement `Y is X*2`. However, it lacks documentation or comments explaining its purpose, which could make it less maintainable. Additionally, the predicate assumes `X` is a number, but there is no error handling for non-numeric inputs."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Clean Up Whitespace**: Remove unnecessary whitespace in predicates like `prove(implies(P,Q))` and `prove(opposite(P))` for better readability.
2. **Remove Redundancy**: Eliminate the redundant `prove(refute(P))` predicate to simplify the codebase.
3. **Add Documentation**: Include comments or documentation for the `expand/2` and `member/2` predicates to clarify their purpose and usage.
4. **Error Handling**: Enhance the `expand(double(X), Y)` predicate to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully, possibly by adding a check or returning a meaningful error.
5. **Clarify Integration**: Ensure all predicates are clearly documented to avoid confusion about their roles in the meta-interpreter.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
