Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in the original code:

```report
{
  "HASH": "99C92279",
  "Report": "The `prove(implies(P,Q))` predicate correctly implements logical implication ('P â‡’ Q') by checking if P is unprovable or Q is provable. The implementation is logically correct and passes all tests. However, the documentation could be enhanced to explicitly state the logical equivalence for better readability. No regeneration is needed for functionality, but documentation improvements are recommended.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "1405B337",
  "Report": "The `prove(opposite(P))` predicate correctly implements negation by checking if P is unprovable. While functionally correct, it is redundant with `prove(refute(P))`. Regeneration is not strictly necessary, but consolidation or clearer documentation of the distinction would improve maintainability.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "C68F7B35",
  "Report": "The `prove(extend(List,Elem,Extended))` predicate correctly extends the list by prepending Elem. The implementation is concise, correct, and fully meets requirements. No issues found; regeneration is unnecessary.",
  "Need_regenerate": false,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

```report
{
  "HASH": "0F69CE0F",
  "Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` predicate correctly doubles numeric inputs but lacks error handling for non-numeric values. While it passes current tests, regeneration is recommended to add type-checking or graceful failure for robustness. Example: `expand(double(X), Y) :- number(X), Y is X*2.`",
  "Need_regenerate": true,
  "Dependencies": []
}
```

### Summary:
- Only the `expand/2` predicate (HASH `0F69CE0F`) requires regeneration for improved robustness.
- Other predicates are functionally correct but could benefit from non-code changes (documentation/clarity improvements).
- No dependencies between code blocks need regeneration.
