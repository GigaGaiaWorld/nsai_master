  "Report": "The `play/3` predicate correctly implements the rock-paper-scissors game rules but has the following issues: 1) It lacks input validation for unequal list lengths, which could lead to runtime errors. 2) The `<Langda>` and `<Code_Block>` tags are not valid ProbLog syntax and should be removed. 3) The predicate works correctly for valid inputs (as shown by the test result), but the code structure could be improved for robustness. Recommendations: 1) Remove the invalid tags. 2) Add length validation for input lists. 3) Consider adding comments for clarity.",

  "Report": "The `compute_score/2` predicate works as intended but could be simplified for better readability. For example, the `draw` case could be merged into a single clause with a condition. The predicate is not directly tied to any specific hash but is part of the overall implementation. Recommendations: 1) Simplify the predicate for clarity. 2) Add comments to explain the scoring logic.",
