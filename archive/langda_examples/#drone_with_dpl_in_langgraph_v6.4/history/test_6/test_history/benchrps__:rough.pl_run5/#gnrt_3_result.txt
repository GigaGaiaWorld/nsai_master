Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <Langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E","Code": "play([], [], []).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [win|Results]) :-\n    beats(P1, P2),\n    play(P1s, P2s, Results).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-\n    (beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose ; Result = draw),\n    play(P1s, P2s, Results)."}
```

Note: The generated code has been improved from the original by:
1. Removing the invalid tags
2. Optimizing the logic by combining the lose/draw cases
3. Maintaining the same functionality while being more concise

The HASH value remains the same as in the original code (CFA63C1E) since this is the identifier for this particular code block.
