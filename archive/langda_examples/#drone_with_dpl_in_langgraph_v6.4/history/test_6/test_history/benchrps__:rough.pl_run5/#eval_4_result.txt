  "Report": "The `play` predicate contains a syntax error with the `->` operator, which is not valid in ProbLog. Additionally, the logic for determining a draw or loss is conflated, leading to incorrect results. The predicate should be split into separate clauses for clarity and correctness. The test results indicate an 'Unknown Clause' error, confirming the syntax issue. The predicate must be regenerated to handle `win`, `lose`, and `draw` outcomes independently and use valid ProbLog syntax.",
