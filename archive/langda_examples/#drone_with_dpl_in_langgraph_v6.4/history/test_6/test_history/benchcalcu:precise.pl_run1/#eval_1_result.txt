Here is the structured evaluation for each code block:

```report
{"HASH": "B6FD3E20","Report": "The code ensures D and E are different digits, which is correct. However, the predicate `digit(D), digit(E), D \\= E` could be combined with the `all_different` checks later for efficiency.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "AFCFFD3D","Report": "The `sumdigit(0, D, E, Y, C1)` predicate is correctly implemented but called redundantly later in the code. This redundancy should be removed.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BA7F9BE8","Report": "The assignment of N and uniqueness check are correct, but the `all_different` list could include all variables upfront to avoid repetition.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "3E567069","Report": "The assignment of R and uniqueness check are correct, but the `all_different` list is repeated unnecessarily.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0BCA612F","Report": "The `sumdigit(C1, N, R, E, C2)` predicate is correctly implemented and logically sound.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "710BBD98","Report": "The assignment of O and uniqueness check are correct, but the `all_different` list is repeated.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58F57C1C","Report": "The `sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3)` predicate is correctly implemented and logically sound.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "70805326","Report": "The assignment of S and uniqueness check are correct, but the `all_different` list is repeated.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "72F32859","Report": "The assignment of M and uniqueness check are correct, but the `all_different` list is repeated.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "4623869C","Report": "The `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` predicate is called twice, which is redundant and should be fixed.","Need_regenerate": true,"Dependencies": []}
```

### Summary of Regenerations:
- **Regenerate**: `AFCFFD3D` (due to redundancy) and `4623869C` (due to redundancy).
- **No Regeneration Needed**: All other blocks are logically correct but could benefit from optimization (e.g., combining `all_different` checks). These optimizations are not critical and do not require regeneration.

### Dependencies:
- No dependencies between blocks require regeneration. The issues are isolated to redundant calls or minor optimizations.
