Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code was:
```prolog
sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)
```

In the generated_code, this block appears as:
```prolog
sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)
```

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "4623869C", "Code": "sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)"}
```
