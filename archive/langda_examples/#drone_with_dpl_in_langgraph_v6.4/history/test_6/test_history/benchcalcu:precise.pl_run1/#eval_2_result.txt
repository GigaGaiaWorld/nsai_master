However, the carry value `C1` is not explicitly validated, which could lead to incorrect propagation of carry values in subsequent steps.

  "Report": "The `sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M)` block is intended to calculate the thousands digit sum (S + M + C3 = O) and enforce the highest digit as M. However, the predicate is called twice, and the logic does not explicitly ensure that the carry result is correctly limited to M. This could lead to incorrect solutions if the carry is not properly handled. The block needs regeneration to remove redundancy and clarify the carry logic.",
