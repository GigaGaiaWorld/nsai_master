  "Report": "The code block implements the shunting-yard algorithm and RPN evaluator correctly for arithmetic operations. However, there are two main issues: 1) The `operator/3` predicate is missing the division operator (`/`) with correct precedence and associativity, causing the 'Unknown Clause' error. 2) The `compute/4` predicate for division lacks proper error handling for division by zero. The logic for parsing and evaluation is otherwise sound.",
