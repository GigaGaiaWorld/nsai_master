  "Report": "The code block implements the shunting-yard algorithm and RPN evaluation correctly for arithmetic operations. However, the error suggests that the division operator (`/`) is not being resolved properly during execution. The `operator` and `compute` predicates are defined, but the runtime error implies a resolution failure, likely due to a mismatch between the symbol `/` and its representation in `detect_operator` or `operator` clauses. The logic for parsing and evaluation is sound, but the integration with the symbol detection predicates needs verification.",
