  "Report": "The `parse` predicate has significant issues that require regeneration. It currently evaluates expressions left-to-right without considering operator precedence, leading to incorrect results for expressions with mixed operators (e.g., `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`). Additionally, it lacks error handling for division by zero and invalid symbols. The predicate should be restructured to handle operator precedence (e.g., using AST or shunting-yard algorithm) and include proper error handling. The test result shows the evaluation is incorrect due to these issues.",
