{"HASH": "95E704F2","Report": "The code block correctly implements the requirements: it checks the length of the list, ensures the list is split only if its length is greater than 1, and splits the list into two parts (`Left` and `Right`). The logic is sound and integrates well with the rest of the code. The only minor issue is that the `split_list` predicate could be documented to clarify its behavior for odd-length lists, but this does not necessitate regeneration.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}

```report
{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Report": "This code block correctly implements the recursive merge sort logic: it sorts the left and right halves of the list and merges them. The logic is correct and passes the test case. The `merge` predicate could be simplified for readability, but this is optional and does not affect functionality. No regeneration is needed.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
