System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

person(a).
person(b).
0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).
0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).
0.1::riskyTravel(X) :- person(X).
0.1::susceptible(X) :- person(X).
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: E09B4F54 </HASH>
<Requirements>inf/1 predicate logic summary Initial infection: Each person has a 0.1 probability of being infected at the beginning Contact transmission: If X has contact with infected person Y, then If X is not susceptible, he will be infected with a probability of 0.6 If X is susceptible, he will be infected with a probability of 0.8 Travel risk: Each person has an additional probability of 0.2 of infection due to high-risk travel </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(inf(_)).

</Code>
<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here
```

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

person(a).
person(b).
0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).
0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).
0.1::riskyTravel(X) :- person(X).
0.1::susceptible(X) :- person(X).
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: E09B4F54 </HASH>
<Requirements>inf/1 predicate logic summary Initial infection: Each person has a 0.1 probability of being infected at the beginning Contact transmission: If X has contact with infected person Y, then If X is not susceptible, he will be infected with a probability of 0.6 If X is susceptible, he will be infected with a probability of 0.8 Travel risk: Each person has an additional probability of 0.2 of infection due to high-risk travel </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(inf(_)).

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

person(a).
person(b).
0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).
0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).
0.1::riskyTravel(X) :- person(X).
0.1::susceptible(X) :- person(X).

% Define the infection logic
0.6::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), \+susceptible(X).
0.8::inf(X) :- contact(X,Y), inf(Y), susceptible(X).
0.2::inf(X) :- riskyTravel(X).
inf(X) :- initialInf(X).

query(inf(_)).

<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
