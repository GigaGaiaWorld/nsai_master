  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate is incomplete and incorrect based on the requirements. It only handles contact transmission for non-susceptible individuals (0.6 probability) but misses: (1) the higher 0.8 probability for susceptible individuals, (2) the 0.2 travel risk probability, and (3) integration with `initialInf/1`. The test result (0.0000 probability) confirms the logical flaw. The predicate needs to be regenerated to include all infection pathways and probabilities specified in the requirements.",
