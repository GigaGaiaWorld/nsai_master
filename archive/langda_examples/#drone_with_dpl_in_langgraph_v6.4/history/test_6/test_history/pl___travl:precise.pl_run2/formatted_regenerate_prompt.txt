System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Code>

person(a).
person(b).
0.1::initialInf(X) :- person(X).
0.1::contact(X,Y) :- person(X), person(Y).
0.1::riskyTravel(X) :- person(X).
0.1::susceptible(X) :- person(X).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>0.1::inf(X) :- initialInf(X).</Code_Block>
<Report>The `inf/1` predicate currently only implements the initial infection probability (0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01) but fails to incorporate the required contact transmission logic (0.6/0.8 depending on susceptibility) and risky travel probability (0.2). This results in incorrect test probabilities (0.0100 for both individuals). The code block needs regeneration to include: (1) contact-based infection rules with susceptibility checks, (2) travel risk probability, and (3) proper probability combination (e.g., using ProbLog's probabilistic disjunction).</Report>

In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
