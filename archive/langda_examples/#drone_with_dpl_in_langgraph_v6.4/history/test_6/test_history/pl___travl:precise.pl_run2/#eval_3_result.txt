  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate logic does not correctly aggregate the probabilities from multiple sources (initial infection, contact transmission, and travel risk). The current implementation treats each clause as independent, leading to lower-than-expected probabilities. The `\+susceptible(X)` condition in the second clause may not be working as intended, as it negates the `susceptible/1` predicate, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The test results show probabilities of 0.0316 for `inf(a)` and `inf(b)`, which are much lower than expected, indicating a logical error in the implementation.",
