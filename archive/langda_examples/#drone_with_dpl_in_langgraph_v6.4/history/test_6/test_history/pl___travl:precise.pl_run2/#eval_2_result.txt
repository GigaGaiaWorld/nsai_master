  "Report": "The `inf/1` predicate currently only implements the initial infection probability (0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01) but fails to incorporate the required contact transmission logic (0.6/0.8 depending on susceptibility) and risky travel probability (0.2). This results in incorrect test probabilities (0.0100 for both individuals). The code block needs regeneration to include: (1) contact-based infection rules with susceptibility checks, (2) travel risk probability, and (3) proper probability combination (e.g., using ProbLog's probabilistic disjunction).",
