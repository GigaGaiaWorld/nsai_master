  "Report": "The code block defines the basic moves (rock, paper, scissor) and the `beats/2` relationship correctly, but it lacks the implementation of the `play/3` predicate, which is critical for simulating the game rounds and generating results (win, lose, or draw). The `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates are logically sound but cannot function without `play/3`. The error in testing confirms this missing functionality. The requirements specify defining the game rules, which are partially implemented but incomplete.",
