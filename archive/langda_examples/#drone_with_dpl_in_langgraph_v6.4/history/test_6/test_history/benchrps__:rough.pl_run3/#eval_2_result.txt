  "Report": "The code block defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors (move/1 and beats/2) and includes a framework for calculating the game score (compute_score/2) and determining the winner (determine_winner/3). However, it lacks the play/3 predicate, which is essential for simulating the game and generating results (win, lose, or draw) for each move. Without this predicate, the code cannot function as intended. The test failure confirms this issue, as the system cannot find clauses for play/3.",
