  "Report": "The `play` predicate is incorrectly implemented. The use of the `->` operator is not valid in ProbLog for conditional logic. Instead, ProbLog requires explicit rules for each condition (win, lose, draw). Additionally, the predicate is not properly integrated with the rest of the code, leading to the 'Unknown Clause' error. The logic for determining the game outcome is correct, but the syntax prevents it from being executed. The code block needs to be regenerated to use explicit rules for each condition and ensure proper integration with the `compute_score` and `determine_winner` predicates.",
