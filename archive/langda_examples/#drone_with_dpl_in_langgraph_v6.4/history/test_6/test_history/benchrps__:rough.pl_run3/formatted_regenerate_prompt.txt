System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Code_Block> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Report>The `play` predicate is incorrectly implemented. The use of the `->` operator is not valid in ProbLog for conditional logic. Instead, ProbLog requires explicit rules for each condition (win, lose, draw). Additionally, the predicate is not properly integrated with the rest of the code, leading to the 'Unknown Clause' error. The logic for determining the game outcome is correct, but the syntax prevents it from being executed. The code block needs to be regenerated to use explicit rules for each condition and ensure proper integration with the `compute_score` and `determine_winner` predicates.</Report>

AI: 


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```
