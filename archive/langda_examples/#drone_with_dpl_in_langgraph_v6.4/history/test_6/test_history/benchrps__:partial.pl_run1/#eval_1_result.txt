Here are the evaluations for each `<langda>` code block in the original code:

```report
{"HASH": "0C388A60", "Report": "The code block defines `move(paper).` correctly, fulfilling the requirement. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Report": "The code block defines `move(scissor).` with a typo (`scissor` instead of `scissors`). This could cause inconsistencies if the game is extended or integrated with other systems.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["58D60F5E"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "59C3D0D4", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(paper, rock).` correctly, fulfilling the requirement. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E", "Report": "The code block defines `beats(scissor, paper).` with the same typo (`scissor` instead of `scissors`). This should be corrected for consistency.", "Need_regenerate": true, "Dependencies": ["BF964057"]}
```

```report
{"HASH": "94C4D48B", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` rule for the `lose` case correctly. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "026B015E", "Report": "The code block defines the `compute_score` rule for the `draw` case correctly. No issues found.", "Need_regenerate": false, "Dependencies": []}
```

### Summary of Regenerations Needed:
1. **HASH BF964057**: Needs regeneration due to the typo in `move(scissor).` (should be `scissors`).
2. **HASH 58D60F5E**: Needs regeneration due to the typo in `beats(scissor, paper).` (should be `scissors`).

### Dependencies:
- The regeneration of `move(scissor).` (HASH BF964057) and `beats(scissor, paper).` (HASH 58D60F5E) are interdependent because both use the misspelled term `scissor`. Both should be corrected to `scissors` for consistency.
