Here are the structured reports for each code block:

```report
{"HASH": "BF964057","Report": "The code block correctly implements `move(scissors).` as required for the rock-paper-scissors game. The only issue is a minor inconsistency in the requirements (using 'scissor' instead of 'scissors'). The code itself is syntactically and logically correct, and it integrates well with the rest of the program. No regeneration is needed for this block.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

```report
{"HASH": "58D60F5E","Report": "The code block correctly implements `beats(scissors, paper).` as required for the rock-paper-scissors game. Similar to the first block, there is a minor inconsistency in the requirements (using 'scissor' instead of 'scissors'). The code is syntactically and logically correct, and it works correctly with the `result/3` and `play/3` predicates. No regeneration is needed for this block.","Need_regenerate": false,"Dependencies": []}
```

### Summary:
- Neither code block needs regeneration as they are both functionally correct.
- The only issues are minor inconsistencies in the requirements (spelling), which do not affect the code's functionality.
- No dependencies exist between these blocks and others that would require regeneration.
