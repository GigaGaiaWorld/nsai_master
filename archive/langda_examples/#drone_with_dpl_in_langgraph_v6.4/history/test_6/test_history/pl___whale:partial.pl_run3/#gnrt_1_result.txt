Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code refers to the uniform distribution definition for the world predicate, which appears only once in the generated_code (the duplicate mentioned in the report is not present in the generated_code).

Here's the extracted code block in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "F46C6231", "Code": "1/6::world(a); 1/6::world(b); 1/6::world(c); 1/6::world(d); 1/6::world(e); 1/6::world(f)."}
```
