  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has significant issues: (1) It uses the unsupported `->` operator for conditional branching, which causes a ParseError in ProbLog. (2) It attempts to use `findall` and `nth1` predicates which are not standard in ProbLog. (3) The implementation doesn't fully align with the requirements for both random and deterministic door opening scenarios. The predicate needs to be rewritten using ProbLog-compatible syntax and logic.",
