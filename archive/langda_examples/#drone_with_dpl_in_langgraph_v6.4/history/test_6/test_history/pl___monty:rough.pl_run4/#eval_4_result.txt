  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has critical issues requiring regeneration:\n1. **Syntax Errors**: Unmatched parentheses and incorrect syntax in the `findall` call (missing closing parenthesis and incorrect list construction).\n2. **Logical Errors**: \n   - Fails to properly implement 50% probability for random door selection when player's door has prize\n   - Incorrect handling of deterministic case (host should open only empty door when player's selection is wrong)\n   - Missing proper integration of probabilistic choice (door_choice/1)\n3. **Requirement Violations**: Does not fully comply with specified behavior for both random and deterministic scenarios.\n4. **Test Impact**: Directly causes parsing failure in test results.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Rewrite predicate with proper syntax\n- Separate logic for random vs deterministic cases\n- Properly implement probability distribution\n- Add clear comments for each scenario",
