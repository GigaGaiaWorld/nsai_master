  "Report": "The `open_door/1` predicate has critical issues requiring regeneration: 1. Syntax Error: The conditional operator `->` is not properly supported in this ProbLog context, causing execution failure. 2. Missing Probability Implementation: The requirement for 50% random door selection isn't properly implemented - `random_member/2` isn't a standard ProbLog predicate. 3. Deterministic Logic Flaw: The `findall/3` approach doesn't guarantee single-door selection in deterministic cases. 4. Integration Failure: The error prevents dependent predicates (`win_switch/0`) from functioning. The implementation needs complete restructuring using ProbLog's probabilistic constructs and proper conditional handling.",
