  "Report": "The `density` predicate is correctly defined to calculate the population density of a country. It uses the `pop` and `area` predicates to compute the density as `Population / Area`. This part of the code is logically and syntactically correct. However, it does not fulfill the complete requirements as it lacks the `query_pop` predicate to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5%). The test failure confirms this missing functionality.",
