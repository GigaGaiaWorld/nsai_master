It successfully uses the digit/2 facts to perform addition on image identifiers, and the test case confirms it produces the correct result (11 for img_5 + img_6). No syntax or logical errors were found. The recommendation to add error handling for undefined images is an enhancement rather than a requirement for regeneration.",
