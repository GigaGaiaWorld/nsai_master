Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<Langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n\ndigit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n\ndigit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\nsumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, 0)."}
```

This JSON object contains:
- The original HASH tag from the `<Langda>` block
- The completed code snippet that replaced the `<Langda>` block in the generated code
- The code maintains all the constraints and predicates from the original incomplete block, now properly integrated with the rest of the solution
