</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis>
The code is intended to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (SEND + MORE = MONEY) using ProbLog. While the logic is mostly correct, there are syntax and logical issues causing the test to fail. The primary issue is a `CallModeError` related to the `is/2` predicate, indicating that the arguments are not ground when they should be. Additionally, the `sumdigit` predicate is not fully implemented as per the requirements.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary>
1. **CallModeError**: The error occurs in the `sumdigit` predicate where the `is/2` predicate is used with non-ground arguments. ProbLog requires the right-hand side of `is/2` to be ground (fully instantiated) at the time of evaluation.
2. **Incomplete Predicate Logic**: The `sumdigit` predicate is not fully implemented to handle all cases of the cryptarithmetic puzzle, leading to logical gaps.
3. **Syntax Issues**: The code block under `<Langda>` is incomplete and lacks proper integration with the rest of the code.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "1039E900",
        "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and lacks proper integration with the rest of the code. The `sumdigit` predicate is not fully implemented, and the `is/2` predicate is used incorrectly, causing a `CallModeError`. The logic for handling carry (`C1`, `C2`, etc.) is also not fully developed."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix `is/2` Usage**: Ensure that the right-hand side of `is/2` is ground. For example, replace `X is C + A + B` with a ground expression or precompute the values.
2. **Complete `sumdigit` Predicate**: Fully implement the `sumdigit` predicate to handle all cases of the cryptarithmetic puzzle, including proper carry propagation.
3. **Integrate Code Blocks**: Ensure the code blocks under `<Langda>` are properly integrated with the rest of the code and that all predicates are fully defined.
4. **Test Incrementally**: Test each part of the code incrementally to identify and fix issues early.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
