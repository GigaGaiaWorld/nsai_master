  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and contains critical errors. The `sumdigit` predicate is incorrectly implemented, leading to a `CallModeError` due to non-ground arithmetic expressions. The constraints for uniqueness (`all_different`) are not consistently enforced, and the `query_sum` predicate is not fully implemented. The block also lacks proper integration with the rest of the code, causing mismatches in variable bindings and constraints.",
