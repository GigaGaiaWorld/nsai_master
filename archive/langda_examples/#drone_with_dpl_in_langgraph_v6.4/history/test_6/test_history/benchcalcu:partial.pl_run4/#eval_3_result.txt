  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and contains critical errors. The `sumdigit` clauses are incorrectly implemented, causing a `CallModeError` due to non-ground arguments in the `is/2` predicate. The `query_sum` predicate lacks proper constraints for solving the cryptarithmetic puzzle. The `all_different` constraints are not fully enforced for all variables. The block needs regeneration to fix these issues and properly implement the logic for the puzzle.",
