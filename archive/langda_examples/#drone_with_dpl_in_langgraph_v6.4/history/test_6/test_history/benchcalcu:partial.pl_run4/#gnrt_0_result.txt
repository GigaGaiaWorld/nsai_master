Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks that correspond to the `<Langda>` section in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n\ndigit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n\ndigit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\nsumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, 0)."}
```

This is the only code block that was needed to complete the `<Langda>` section in the original code. The block completes the predicate logic by:
1. Adding constraints for digit O and ensuring it's different from previous digits
2. Adding constraints for digit M and ensuring it's different from previous digits
3. Adding constraints for digit S (which must be a left digit â‰  0) and the final sum check
