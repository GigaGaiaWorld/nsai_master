Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n\ndigit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n\ndigit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\nsumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, 0)."}
```

Note that this is the exact code block that was marked with <Langda> tags in the origin_code, now properly formatted in JSON format with its corresponding hash value. The code completes the predicate logic for the cryptarithmetic puzzle by:
1. Adding constraints for digit O
2. Performing the sumdigit operation for E+O with carry
3. Adding constraints for digit M
4. Performing the sumdigit operation for S+M with carry
5. Adding final constraints for digit S
6. Performing the final sumdigit check for the solution
