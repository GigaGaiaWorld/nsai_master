  "Report": "The code block contains critical syntax and logical errors. The primary issue is the misuse of the `is/2` predicate, which requires the second argument to be ground. Additionally, the `query_sum` predicate is incomplete and lacks proper integration with the `sumdigit` and `all_different` predicates. The constraints for solving the cryptarithmetic puzzle are not fully enforced, and the logic is fragmented. The test results confirm these issues with a `CallModeError`.",
