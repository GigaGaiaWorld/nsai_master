System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>number([], 0).
number([H|T], N) :-
    digit(H, D),
    number(T, M),
    N is M * 10 + D.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 06576BEB </HASH>
<Requirements>define number predicate, to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. </Requirements></Langda>
.
multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,X2),number(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],310) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values and perform addition. The test result shows the correct output for the given query, indicating that the logic is functionally correct for the provided test case. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and potential edge cases that need to be addressed for robustness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. The `digit` facts are not enclosed in a proper ProbLog program block (e.g., `program` or `model`).
2. The `number` predicate does not handle edge cases like an empty list or invalid image IDs gracefully.
3. The `multi_addition` predicate lacks validation for input lists, which could lead to runtime errors if invalid inputs are provided.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "06576BEB",
        "Report": "The `digit` facts are correctly defined but are not enclosed in a proper ProbLog program block. This could cause issues in larger programs where multiple blocks are involved. Additionally, the `number` predicate is logically correct but lacks error handling for invalid image IDs or empty lists."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for the `multi_addition` predicate)",
        "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate correctly uses the `number` predicate to convert lists of image IDs to integers and performs addition. However, it does not validate the input lists, which could lead to runtime errors if the lists contain invalid image IDs or are malformed."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Enclose the `digit` facts and `number` predicate in a proper ProbLog program block (e.g., `model` or `program`).
2. Add error handling in the `number` predicate to handle edge cases like empty lists or invalid image IDs (e.g., by returning an error or default value).
3. Validate the input lists in the `multi_addition` predicate to ensure they contain valid image IDs before processing.
4. Include additional test cases to verify the robustness of the code, such as empty lists, lists with invalid image IDs, and larger numbers.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
