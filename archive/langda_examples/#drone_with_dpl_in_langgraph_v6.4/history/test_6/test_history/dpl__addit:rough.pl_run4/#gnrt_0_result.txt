Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> section in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code requested a "number" predicate definition, which appears in the generated_code as:

```problog
{"HASH": "06576BEB", "Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :-\n    digit(H, D),\n    number(T, M),\n    N is M * 10 + D."}
```

This is the only code block that was missing from the origin_code (marked by <langda>) and was completed in the generated_code. The other parts of the code were already present in the origin_code.
