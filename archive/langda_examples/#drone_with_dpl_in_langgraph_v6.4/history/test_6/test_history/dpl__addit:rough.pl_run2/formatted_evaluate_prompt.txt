System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
<Langda>
<Code_Block>number([], 0).
number([H|T], N) :-
    digit(H, D),
    number(T, N1),
    N is N1 * 10 + D.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 06576BEB </HASH>
<Requirements>define number predicate, to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. </Requirements></Langda>
.
multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,X2),number(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.
query(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
multi_addition([img_7, img_9],[img_3, img_1, img_2],310) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is syntactically valid and implements the specified requirements to convert a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values and perform addition. The test result shows the correct output for the given query, indicating that the logic is functioning as intended. However, there are minor issues in the code structure and potential improvements for clarity and robustness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. The `digit` facts are not enclosed in a proper ProbLog program block, which could lead to confusion in larger programs.
2. The `number` predicate is correctly implemented but lacks comments or documentation for clarity.
3. The `multi_addition` predicate works as expected but could be generalized for more use cases.
4. No explicit error handling is present for invalid inputs (e.g., non-existent image IDs).
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "06576BEB",
        "Report": "The `digit` facts are correctly defined but are not enclosed in a ProbLog program block. This could cause issues in larger programs where multiple blocks are used. Additionally, the `number` predicate is logically correct but lacks comments or documentation to explain its purpose and usage."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `multi_addition` predicate is correctly implemented and produces the expected result for the given test case. However, it could be improved by adding error handling for invalid inputs and generalizing it for more use cases."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. Enclose the `digit` facts in a proper ProbLog program block for better organization.
2. Add comments or documentation to the `number` predicate to explain its logic and usage.
3. Extend the `multi_addition` predicate to handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., by checking if the image IDs exist in the `digit` facts).
4. Consider generalizing the `multi_addition` predicate to handle more than two lists or other arithmetic operations.
5. Add more test cases to validate edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with invalid image IDs.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
