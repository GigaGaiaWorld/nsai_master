The `query_sum` predicate is missing critical parts of the cryptarithmetic puzzle constraints, such as the final summation checks for 'SEND + MORE = MONEY'. Additionally, the syntax error suggests misplaced or missing tokens in the code. The block needs to be regenerated to include the complete logic for the puzzle and to fix the syntax issues.",
