Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n\ndigit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n\ndigit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, 0)"}
```

This JSON object contains:
- The original HASH tag from the <langda> block
- The completed code snippet that was missing in the original code
- The code maintains all the critical predicates and logic needed for the cryptarithmetic puzzle solution
