  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains syntax errors. The `query_sum` predicate is missing critical parts of its logic, such as the final constraints for the sum. The `sumdigit` clauses are not properly integrated into the main predicate, leading to ambiguity in the parsing process. Additionally, the code fails to execute due to a parsing error ('Ambiguous token role'). The requirements to complete the predicate logic are not fully met.",
