  "Report": "The code block is incomplete and lacks a closing parenthesis for the `query_sum` predicate. Additionally, the `sumdigit` predicate is not correctly integrated into the main logic, leading to potential issues with variable instantiation. The error in the `is/2` predicate indicates that variables are not properly instantiated before arithmetic operations. The block also fails to fully implement the cryptarithmetic puzzle logic, as it does not correctly handle the carry-over in the addition process.",
