Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<Langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n\ndigit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n\ndigit(S), leftdigit(S), all_different([S,M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, 0),\n\n% Final check for SEND + MORE = MONEY\nSEND is 1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D,\nMORE is 1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E,\nMONEY is 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y,\nSEND + MORE =:= MONEY."}
```

Note that I included both:
1. The original code block that was marked with `<Langda>` (now completed)
2. The additional final check for the cryptarithmetic puzzle that was added in the generated solution

The hash tag remains the same as in the original (`1039E900`) since this is the completion of that specific code block.
