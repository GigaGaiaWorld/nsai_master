  "HASH": "1039E900",
  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains critical parts of the cryptarithmetic logic that are missing from the main code. Specifically, it includes predicates like `digit(O)`, `sumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3)`, etc., which are essential for solving the puzzle but are not integrated into the main code. This incompleteness leads to a parsing error ('Ambiguous token role') and prevents the code from running correctly. The block also lacks proper termination and integration with the rest of the code.",
