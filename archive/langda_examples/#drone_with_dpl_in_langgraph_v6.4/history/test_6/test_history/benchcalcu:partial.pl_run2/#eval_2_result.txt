  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains critical issues. The main problem is the `CallModeError` due to unbound variables in arithmetic operations (`sumdigit`). The block also lacks proper constraints for variables like `M` and `O`, and the `sumdigit` calls do not enforce digit uniqueness before arithmetic operations. This leads to logical inconsistencies and runtime errors. The block needs to be restructured to ensure all variables are ground before arithmetic evaluation and to fully constrain all digits.",
