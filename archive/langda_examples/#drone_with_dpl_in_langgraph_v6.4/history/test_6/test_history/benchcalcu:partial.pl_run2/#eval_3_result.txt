  "HASH": "1039E900",
  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and contains critical errors. The primary issue is the misuse of the `is/2` predicate in the `sumdigit` clauses, leading to a `CallModeError` because the second argument must be ground. Additionally, the block lacks proper constraints for the cryptarithmetic puzzle (e.g., ensuring SEND + MORE = MONEY) and does not fully enforce digit uniqueness. The `query_sum` predicate is also incomplete, missing necessary arithmetic checks. The block needs regeneration to correct these issues and properly implement the puzzle's logic.",
