  "Report": "The `play` predicate uses Prolog-style conditional statements (`->`), which are not valid in ProbLog. This causes a syntax error and prevents the code from executing. Additionally, the predicate does not handle edge cases, such as empty lists, correctly. The syntax needs to be revised to use ProbLog-compatible constructs, such as separate clauses for each condition (win, lose, draw). The logic for determining the game result is otherwise correct but needs to be reimplemented in a ProbLog-compatible way.",
