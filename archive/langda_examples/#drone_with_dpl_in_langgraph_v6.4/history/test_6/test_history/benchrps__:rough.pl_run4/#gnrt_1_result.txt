Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the `<generated_code>` that corresponds to the `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "play([], [], []).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-\n    (beats(P1, P2), Result = win;\n    beats(P2, P1), Result = lose;\n    Result = draw,\n    play(P1s, P2s, Results)."}
```

Note: This is the only code block that was marked with `<langda>` in the original code. The other parts of the generated code were already complete in the original or didn't have corresponding `<langda>` blocks.
