Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the `<generated_code>` that correspond to the `<langda>` blocks in the `<origin_code>`:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "play([], [], []).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-\n    (beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win;\n    (beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose;\n    Result = draw)),\n    play(P1s, P2s, Results)."}
```

Note: There was only one `<langda>` block in the `<origin_code>`, so only one JSON entry is provided. The hash tag `CFA63C1E` matches the one from the original `<langda>` block. The code has been properly formatted with the corrected syntax and logical flow as described in the report.
