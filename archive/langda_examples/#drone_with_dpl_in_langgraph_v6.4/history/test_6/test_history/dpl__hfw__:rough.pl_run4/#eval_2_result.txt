  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is syntactically correct and implements the required arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). However, it has logical flaws: 1) It assumes left-associative evaluation, which may not match standard arithmetic precedence rules. 2) The division-by-zero check (`R =:= 0 -> fail`) does not propagate errors to the caller, making debugging difficult. 3) The predicate does not handle operator precedence (e.g., multiplication before addition). The test failure indicates integration issues with `detect_all/2` and `expression/2`, but the core logic of `parse/2` is functional for simple cases.",
