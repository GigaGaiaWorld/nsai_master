  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is logically correct and implements the required arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). However, the error arises because the predicate is not being invoked with the correct input format. The `detect_all/2` predicate must ensure the parsed symbols are in a format compatible with `parse/2`. The predicate itself does not need regeneration, but the surrounding code (`detect_all/2`) does to ensure proper integration.",
