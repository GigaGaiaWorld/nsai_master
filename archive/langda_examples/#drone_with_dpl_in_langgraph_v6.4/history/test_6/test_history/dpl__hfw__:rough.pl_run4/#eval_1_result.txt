  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is intended to recursively evaluate arithmetic expressions but has critical issues. It fails to handle operator precedence correctly (e.g., multiplication/division should take precedence over addition/subtraction). The use of `->/2` is problematic in ProbLog, as it is not a standard arithmetic operator and causes an 'UnknownClause' error. The predicate also lacks error handling for division by zero or invalid operators. The implementation does not align with ProbLog's syntax requirements for arithmetic operations.",
