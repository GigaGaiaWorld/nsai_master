  "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is syntactically correct and logically implements the required arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). However, the error suggests that the predicate is not being recognized by the ProbLog engine. This could be due to a missing or incorrect module/context declaration, the predicate being defined in a separate block without proper integration, or a typo/formatting issue in the predicate name or arguments. The error 'UnknownClause' indicates the engine cannot resolve the predicate, which is critical for the program's functionality. The division-by-zero check is present but unreachable due to this issue.",
