Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> block in <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "190031BC", "Code": "parse([N], N).\nparse([N, O | T], Result) :-\n    parse(T, R),\n    (O = '+', Result is N + R\n    ; O = '-', Result is N - R\n    ; O = '*', Result is N * R\n    ; O = '/', (R =:= 0 -> fail ; Result is N / R)\n    )."}
```

This is the only code block that was marked with <langda> in the original code, and it has been formatted with its corresponding hash value from the original file.
