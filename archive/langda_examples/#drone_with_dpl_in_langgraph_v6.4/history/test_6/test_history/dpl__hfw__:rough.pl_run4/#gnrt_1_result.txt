Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "190031BC", "Code": "parse([N], N).\nparse([N, O | T], Result) :-\n    parse(T, R),\n    (O = '+', Result is N + R\n    ; O = '-', Result is N - R\n    ; O = '*', Result is N * R\n    ; O = '/', (R =:= 0 -> fail ; Result is N / R)\n    )."}
```

The changes made in the generated code include:
1. Replaced the `->` operator with commas for better Prolog syntax
2. Added division by zero check (`R =:= 0 -> fail`)
3. Maintained the same functionality for arithmetic operations
4. Kept the same hash tag from the original requirements
