<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...

  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code aims to implement a recursive expression evaluator in ProbLog, capable of parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions involving numbers and operators. The test results indicate a failure due to an unknown clause error, suggesting a mismatch between the predicate definitions and their usage. The overall structure of the code is logical, but the integration between the `detect_all/2` and `parse/2` predicates is flawed, leading to runtime errors.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Unknown Clause Error**: The error `No clauses found for ''->'/2'` indicates that the `parse/2` predicate is not being called correctly or is missing necessary clauses. This is likely due to the `detect_all/2` predicate not properly passing the parsed symbols to `parse/2`.
2. **Logical Flaw**: The `detect_all/2` predicate does not handle the case where the input list is empty or improperly formatted, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. **Division Handling**: The `parse/2` predicate correctly handles division by zero, but the error message is not user-friendly.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "190031BC",
        "Report": "The `parse/2` predicate is logically correct and implements the required arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). However, the error arises because the predicate is not being invoked with the correct input format. The `detect_all/2` predicate must ensure the parsed symbols are in a format compatible with `parse/2`."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A",
        "Report": "The `detect_all/2` predicate is incomplete. It does not handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one operator. Additionally, it assumes the input list alternates between numbers and operators, which may not always be the case. This can lead to incorrect parsing and runtime errors."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Fix `detect_all/2`**: Ensure the `detect_all/2` predicate correctly formats the output list for `parse/2`. Add checks for edge cases (e.g., empty lists or invalid sequences).
2. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance the `parse/2` predicate to provide more descriptive error messages, especially for division by zero.
3. **Test Cases**: Add test cases to validate the code against various input formats, including edge cases.
4. **Debugging**: Use debugging tools or print statements to verify the intermediate output of `detect_all/2` before it is passed to `parse/2`.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
