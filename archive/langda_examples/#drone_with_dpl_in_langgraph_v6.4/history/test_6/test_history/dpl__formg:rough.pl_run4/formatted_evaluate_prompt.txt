System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code_Block>% Merge Sort in ProbLog

% Base case for an empty list
merge_sort([], []).

% Base case for a single-element list
merge_sort([X], [X]).

% Recursive case: split the list, sort the halves, and merge them
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    List = [_, _ | _], % Ensure the list has at least two elements
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

% Split the list into two halves
split([], [], []).
split([X], [X], []).
split([X, Y | Tail], [X | Left], [Y | Right]) :-
    split(Tail, Left, Right).

% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X | LeftTail], [Y | RightTail], [X | Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(LeftTail, [Y | RightTail], Merged).
merge([X | LeftTail], [Y | RightTail], [Y | Merged]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X | LeftTail], RightTail, Merged).

% Example query
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 418D2062 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable merge_sort/2 algorithm </Requirements></Langda>
.
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>
```

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> "The provided ProbLog code implements a merge sort algorithm, and the test results confirm that it correctly sorts the input list [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12] into [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]. The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the given requirements. However, there are minor issues related to code organization and redundancy." </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "No critical errors were found in the code. The issues identified are related to the presence of redundant code (the `append/3` predicate) and the lack of clarity in the separation of the example query from the main code block." </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "418D2062",
        "Report": "The merge sort implementation is correct and adheres to the requirements. The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` are well-defined and function as expected. The test result confirms the correctness of the implementation."</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "N/A (for the redundant `append/3` predicate)",
        "Report": "The `append/3` predicate is redundant in this context, as it is not used anywhere in the merge sort implementation. Its presence adds unnecessary clutter to the code."</Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"1. Remove the redundant `append/3` predicate to improve code clarity. 2. Ensure that example queries are clearly separated or commented to avoid confusion. 3. Consider adding more test cases to validate edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with duplicate elements." </Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
