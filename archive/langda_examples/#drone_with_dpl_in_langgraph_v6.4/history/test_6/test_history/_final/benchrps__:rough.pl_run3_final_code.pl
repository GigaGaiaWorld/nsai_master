Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It maintains the same logic for determining the winner in a rock-paper-scissors game. The main difference is in the implementation of the 'play' predicate, where the generated code uses separate clauses for win, lose, and draw conditions, while the original code uses a single 'result' predicate. Both approaches are valid and produce the same results. The generated code meets the requirements and runs correctly.
