Validity_form:True\Validity_result:False
The generated code introduces additional checks for valid moves and list lengths, which are not present in the original code. While these checks could be useful for validation, they are not required by the original problem specification. The main issue is that the generated code's query result is incorrect (0.0000 probability) compared to the original code's correct result (1.0000 probability for player2). This discrepancy suggests a problem in the generated code's implementation, likely due to the additional constraints interfering with the normal execution flow.
