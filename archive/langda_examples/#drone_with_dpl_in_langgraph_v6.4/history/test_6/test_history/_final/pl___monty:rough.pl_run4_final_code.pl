***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but contains syntax errors that prevent it from running. Specifically, there's a parse error due to operator priority clash at line 13:28. The original code correctly models the problem and runs without errors, producing expected probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors. The generated code's structure is similar but fails in implementation.
