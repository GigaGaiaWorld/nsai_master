System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Code>
digit(img_1,1).
digit(img_2,2).
digit(img_3,3).
digit(img_4,4).
digit(img_5,5).
digit(img_6,6).
digit(img_7,7).
digit(img_8,8).
digit(img_9,9).
digit(img_0,0).
addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A + B.</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6E46AD63 </HASH>
<Requirements>addition logic, input as img_1 to img_0 </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>
<Recommendations>"Recommendations for fixing the issues" </Recommendations>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

.
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
<Result> Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000</Result>

</original_code>
<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The codebase is a simple ProbLog program designed to perform addition on digits represented by images (img_1 to img_0). The test result shows that the addition logic works correctly for the given query (addition(img_5, img_6, Z)), producing the expected output of 11. However, there are minor syntactical and structural issues in the code that need to be addressed for clarity and correctness.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Syntax Error**: The `addition` predicate is not properly closed with a period (.) in the first part of the code.
2. **Structural Issue**: The code is split into two parts without clear separation or comments, which could lead to confusion.
3. **Redundancy**: The `addition` predicate is defined twice (once incompletely and once correctly), which is unnecessary.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "6E46AD63",
        "Report": "The `addition` predicate is correctly implemented here, but the surrounding code structure is messy. The predicate is defined twice, and the first definition is incomplete (missing the closing period). This redundancy should be removed."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Remove Redundancy**: Delete the incomplete `addition` predicate definition and keep only the one with the correct logic (the one with the hash `6E46AD63`).
2. **Fix Syntax**: Ensure all predicates are properly closed with a period (.).
3. **Improve Code Structure**: Organize the code into clear sections with comments for better readability. For example:
   

4. **Test Coverage**: While the test case provided works correctly, consider adding more test cases to ensure the logic handles all edge cases (e.g., adding img_0 to other digits).
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
