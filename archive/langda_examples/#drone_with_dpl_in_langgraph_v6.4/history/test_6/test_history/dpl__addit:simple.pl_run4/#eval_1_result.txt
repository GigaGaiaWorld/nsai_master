  "Report": "The code block for the 'addition' predicate is correctly implemented and adheres to the requirements. It successfully performs addition on the digit values extracted from the image labels. The test result confirms its functionality. However, the formatting could be improved for better readability (e.g., removing unnecessary line breaks). No logical or syntax errors were found. The code does not need regeneration for functionality, but minor formatting adjustments could be made for consistency.",
