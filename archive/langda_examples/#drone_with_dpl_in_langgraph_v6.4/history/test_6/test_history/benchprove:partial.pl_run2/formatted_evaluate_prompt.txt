System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The code is syntactically valid and logically correct for the most part. The test results indicate that all queries return the expected results (1.0000), suggesting that the implemented logic aligns with the requirements. The meta-interpreter and extended logic processing functions (e.g., `implies`, `opposite`, `expand`, `includes`, `extend`) are correctly implemented and integrated. However, there are minor stylistic and potential robustness issues that could be addressed.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
No critical errors were identified in the code. The test results confirm that the logic works as intended. However, the following observations could improve the code:
1. The `implies` and `opposite` predicates rely on negation (`\+`), which may not always behave as expected in more complex scenarios (e.g., when variables are involved).
2. The `expand` predicate is hardcoded for `double(X)`, which limits its reusability for other expansion rules.
3. The `extend` predicate assumes the input `List` is a proper list, but no checks are in place to validate this.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "99C92279",
        "Report": "The `implies(P,Q)` predicate correctly implements the logic 'P ⇒ Q' by checking if P is unprovable or Q is provable. However, the use of negation (`\+`) may lead to unexpected behavior if P contains unbound variables. This could be mitigated by ensuring P is ground before negation."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "1405B337",
        "Report": "The `opposite(P)` predicate correctly implements negation by checking if P is unprovable. Like `implies`, it relies on `\+`, which may not work as intended with unbound variables. A groundness check could improve robustness."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "C68F7B35",
        "Report": "The `extend(List,Elem,Extended)` predicate correctly adds `Elem` to the head of `List`. However, it assumes `List` is a proper list. Adding a check for list validity (e.g., using `is_list/1`) would make the predicate more robust."
    </Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "0F69CE0F",
        "Report": "The `expand(double(X), Y)` predicate correctly implements the expansion rule `Y is X * 2`. However, the predicate is specific to `double(X)`. A more general approach (e.g., using dynamic rules or a lookup table) would allow for other expansion rules."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Groundness Checks**: Add checks to ensure variables are ground before using negation (`\+`) in `implies` and `opposite` predicates.
2. **Generalize `expand`**: Consider defining `expand` rules dynamically or using a lookup table to support multiple expansion rules.
3. **List Validation**: Add a check (e.g., `is_list/1`) in the `extend` predicate to validate the input list.
4. **Documentation**: Document the assumptions and limitations of predicates like `implies` and `opposite` to guide users.
5. **Testing**: Expand test cases to include edge cases (e.g., unbound variables, invalid lists) to ensure robustness.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
