Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the completed code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code appears to be a placeholder for completing the rules in the zebra puzzle. Looking at the generated_code, the completed version includes the line `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),` which was missing in the origin_code's incomplete section.

Here's the formatted JSON for the completed code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```

This is the only code block that was completed in the generated_code that corresponds to the <Langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The rest of the code remained unchanged between the origin and generated versions.
