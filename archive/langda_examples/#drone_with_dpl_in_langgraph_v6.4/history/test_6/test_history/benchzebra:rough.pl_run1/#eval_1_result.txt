  "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete and appears to be a partial implementation of a constraint for the zebra puzzle. The rule `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)` is correct but lacks surrounding context or additional constraints that might be necessary for the puzzle's solution. The timeout error in the test results suggests that the incomplete or inefficient implementation could be contributing to the problem. The block should be regenerated to include all necessary constraints and ensure logical correctness.",
