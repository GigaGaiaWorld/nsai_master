Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code was:
```prolog
my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)
```

In the generated_code, this appears as part of the complete zebra predicate. Here's the extracted and formatted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses"}
```

Note that this is the same code as in the <langda> block since the generated_code didn't modify this particular line - it was already correct but just needed to be placed in the proper context with other constraints. The generated_code shows it properly integrated with the rest of the zebra puzzle constraints.
