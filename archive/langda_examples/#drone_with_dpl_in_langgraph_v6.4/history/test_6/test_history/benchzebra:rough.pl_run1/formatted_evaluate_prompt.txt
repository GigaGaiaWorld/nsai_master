System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the code in <Code> block, evaluate test results in <Result> block, and identify issues that need to be fixed.

<Result> Here are the testing result of code:

    raise TimeoutError(f"Function timed out while processing file: {file_basename}")
TimeoutError: Function timed out while processing file: benchzebra:rough.pl_run1</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
First, analyze the entire codebase and test results to identify errors and potential issues. Consider:
1. Syntax correctness: Is the ProbLog code syntactically valid?
2. Logical correctness: Does the code implement the specified requirements?
3. Error analysis: What specific issues are causing any test failures?
4. Integration: Do the code blocks properly work together?

Create a comprehensive report that identifies all issues and explains their causes.
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The evaluation report should be structured as follows:
```report
<Overall_Analysis> "Overall assessment of the code quality and test results" </Overall_Analysis>
<Error_Summary> "Summary of identified errors and their root causes (if any)" </Error_Summary>
<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for first code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of first code here"</Code>
    <Code>"HASH": "[Use the exact HASH provided in the requirements for second code]",
        "Report": "// Your analysis of second code here"</Code>
    // other code blocks...
</Code_Block_Issues>

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

<Analysis>

<Overall_Analysis> 
The provided ProbLog code is intended to solve the classic "zebra puzzle," which involves deducing the arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of clues. The code is mostly syntactically correct but appears incomplete, as indicated by the placeholder `<Langda>` and the requirement to "complete the rules." The test results show a timeout error, suggesting that the code may be stuck in an infinite loop or is too inefficient to complete within the allotted time. This could be due to missing constraints or incorrect logic in the rules.
</Overall_Analysis>

<Error_Summary> 
1. **Incomplete Code**: The `<Langda>` section indicates that the code is incomplete, and the requirement to "complete the rules" is not fulfilled.
2. **Timeout Error**: The test results indicate a timeout, which could be caused by:
   - Missing constraints leading to an infinite search space.
   - Inefficient or incorrect logic in the `next_to` or `my_member` predicates.
3. **Potential Logical Gaps**: Some clues from the puzzle might not be fully implemented, such as the relationship between the Norwegian and the blue house.
</Error_Summary>

<Code_Block_Issues>
    <Code>"HASH": "0F506A43",
        "Report": "The code block under this hash is incomplete. It includes a partial rule `my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)`, but the surrounding context suggests that additional constraints or rules are missing. This incompleteness could lead to incorrect or infinite solutions during execution."
    </Code>
</Code_Block_Issues>

<Recommendations>
1. **Complete the Rules**: Ensure all clues from the zebra puzzle are implemented. For example:
   - Add the constraint that the Norwegian lives in the first house.
   - Clarify the relationship between the Norwegian and the blue house (e.g., the Norwegian lives next to the blue house).
2. **Optimize the Search**: Review the `next_to` and `my_member` predicates to ensure they are efficient and do not lead to redundant or infinite searches.
3. **Debugging**: Test the code incrementally by adding one constraint at a time to identify which part causes the timeout.
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the implementation of each clue to ensure logical correctness and ease of debugging.
</Recommendations>

</Analysis>
<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code block in the original code:
1. Identify the corresponding HASH value
2. Analyze whether it has issues based on the analysis
3. Determine if it needs regeneration
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your decision
5. If there are dependencies between code blocks, identify them

Consider:
- Syntax and logical correctness
- Integration with other code blocks
- Test failures related to this code block
- Implementation of requirements
</Evaluation_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> For each code block that needs evaluation, provide a structured report in the following JSON format:
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": ["HASH5678", "HASH9101"] // Only include if this code block depends on others that also need regeneration}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","Report": "Detailed analysis of issues and recommendations for this specific code block","Need_regenerate": true|false,"Dependencies": [] // Empty if no dependencies need regeneration}
```
