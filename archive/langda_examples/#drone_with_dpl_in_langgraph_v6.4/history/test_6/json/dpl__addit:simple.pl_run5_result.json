  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define digit facts and an addition rule that sums the digits of two images. The generated code uses different variable names (A, B) in the addition rule compared to the original (X2, Y2), but this does not affect the logic or outcome. The query and results are identical in both cases, producing the correct sum of 11 for the addition of img_5 and img_6."
