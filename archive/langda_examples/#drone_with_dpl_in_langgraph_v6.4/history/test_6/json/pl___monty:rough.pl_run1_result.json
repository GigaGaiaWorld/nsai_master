  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and invalid. It lacks the crucial 'open_door' predicate definitions that were present in the original code, which leads to a runtime error ('UnknownClause'). While the helper predicate 'get_empty_door' was added, it's not properly integrated or used. The original code correctly models the Monty Hall problem with proper probability distributions for door opening, while the generated version fails to execute due to missing clauses."
