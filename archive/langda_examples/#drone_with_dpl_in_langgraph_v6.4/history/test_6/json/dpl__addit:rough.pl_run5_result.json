  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of digit images into their corresponding numerical values and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly computes the sum of numbers represented by lists of digit images. The running results are consistent with the expected behavior, demonstrating that the generated code works as intended."
