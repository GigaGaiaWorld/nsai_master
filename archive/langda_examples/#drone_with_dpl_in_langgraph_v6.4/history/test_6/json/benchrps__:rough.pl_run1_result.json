Additionally, it contains duplicate definitions of 'compute_score/2'. These omissions and redundancies lead to a runtime error when trying to execute the query, as the system cannot find the necessary clauses for 'play/3'. The original code runs successfully and produces the expected result, while the generated code fails to execute."
