  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the core functionalities, including the meta-interpreter and extended logic processing. The only notable difference is the addition of 'number(X)' in the expand rule for 'double(X)', which adds a type check but does not affect the functionality in the given examples. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence in behavior."
