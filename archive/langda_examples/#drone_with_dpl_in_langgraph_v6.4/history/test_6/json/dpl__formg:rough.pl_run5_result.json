  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It implements the merge sort algorithm with slight modifications in the split/3 predicate, which now splits the list in a pairwise manner instead of using length and append. This change does not affect the correctness of the algorithm. Both codes produce the same sorted output for the given query, demonstrating consistency in results."
