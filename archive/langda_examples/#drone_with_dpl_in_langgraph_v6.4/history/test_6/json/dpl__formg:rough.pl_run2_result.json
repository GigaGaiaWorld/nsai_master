  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. It implements the merge sort algorithm accurately, including the base cases, recursive splitting, and merging of sorted lists. The logic for splitting and merging is identical to the original code, and the variable names are slightly more descriptive in the generated code. Both codes produce the same correct result when sorting the list [3,1,2,5,7,12]."
