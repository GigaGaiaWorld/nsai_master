  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. It introduces several issues compared to the original code. First, it incorrectly adds a new sumdigit call with 'sumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, 0)' which doesn't make logical sense in the cryptarithmetic puzzle context. Second, it changes the order of digit assignments and constraints, particularly for S and M, which breaks the logical flow of the original puzzle. The generated code results in a runtime error due to invalid argument types in the 'is/2' call, indicating it's not valid Problog code."
