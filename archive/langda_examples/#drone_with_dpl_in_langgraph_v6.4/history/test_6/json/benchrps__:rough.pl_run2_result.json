  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It simplifies the 'result' predicate into an 'outcome' predicate while maintaining the same logic for determining game results. The structure of the 'play', 'compute_score', and 'determine_winner' predicates remains unchanged, ensuring the same behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
