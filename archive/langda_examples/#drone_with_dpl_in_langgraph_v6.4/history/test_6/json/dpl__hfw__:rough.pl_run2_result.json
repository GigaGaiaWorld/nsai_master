  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid as it introduces a new predicate 'split_at_lowest_precedence/4' which is not defined anywhere in the code. This causes an error during execution. The original code correctly implements arithmetic expression parsing through direct recursive descent parsing, while the generated code attempts a different approach without providing the necessary supporting predicates. The running results are inconsistent because the generated code fails to execute at all due to the missing predicate."
