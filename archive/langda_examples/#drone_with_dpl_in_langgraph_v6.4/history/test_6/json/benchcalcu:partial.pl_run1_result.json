  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve the same cryptarithmetic puzzle as the original code but introduces several issues. It adds an unnecessary check for 'SEND + MORE = MONEY' using arithmetic operations, which is not compatible with Problog's evaluation mode. This causes a runtime error due to invalid argument types in the 'is/2' predicate. The original code correctly uses constraints and digit assignments to find the solution without such arithmetic checks. The generated code also incorrectly places the 'digit(M)' constraint before 'digit(S)', which disrupts the logical flow of the original solution."
