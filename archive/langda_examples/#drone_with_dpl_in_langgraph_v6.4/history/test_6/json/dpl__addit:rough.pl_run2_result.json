  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of digit images into their corresponding numerical values and performs addition on these numbers. This is a valid extension and demonstrates consistency with the original code's approach to digit recognition and arithmetic operations. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as evidenced by the successful execution and correct result of the multi_addition query."
