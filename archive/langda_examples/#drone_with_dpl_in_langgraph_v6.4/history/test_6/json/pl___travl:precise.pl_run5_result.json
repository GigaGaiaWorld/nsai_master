  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally consistent with the original code, maintaining the same predicates and probabilistic rules. However, the running results differ significantly (0.1245 vs. 0.0316), indicating a potential issue in the probability calculations or rule ordering. The generated code's logic appears correct, but the discrepancy in results suggests a problem in execution or probability combination."
