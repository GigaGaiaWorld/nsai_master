  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. It accurately replicates all the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The variable names in the generated code are slightly different (using 'Rest' instead of 'Stack' in some cases), but this does not affect the functionality or the results. Both codes produce identical results when run, as evidenced by the matching run results."
