  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. It includes base cases for empty and single-element lists, a recursive case for splitting and merging, and a merge predicate. The generated code uses a different approach for splitting the list, which is more concise but functionally equivalent. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same sorted list. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
