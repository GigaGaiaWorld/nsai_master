  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic and produces the same results as the original code. The main difference is in the organization and clarity of the rules for opening doors, which are more explicitly separated into probabilistic and deterministic cases in the generated code. This improves readability without altering the functionality. Both codes correctly calculate the probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors."
