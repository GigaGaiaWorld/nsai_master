  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. Both implementations of insertion sort follow the same logic: recursively sorting the tail of the list and then inserting the head into the sorted tail. The generated code renames 'insert_element' to 'insert', but the functionality remains identical. The query and its result are also the same in both cases, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000."
