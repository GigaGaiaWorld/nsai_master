  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement insertion sort in Prolog with identical logic. The generated code renames 'insert_element' to 'insert' but maintains the same behavior. The query and results are also identical, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000. There are no functional or logical issues in the generated code."
