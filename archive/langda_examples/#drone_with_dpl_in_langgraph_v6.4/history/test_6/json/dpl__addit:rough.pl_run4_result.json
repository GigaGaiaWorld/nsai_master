  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle lists of images representing multi-digit numbers and their conversion to numerical values. The 'multi_addition' predicate then performs addition on these multi-digit numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly processes the input and produces the expected output. The running results of both pieces of code are consistent with their respective functionalities, with the original code handling single-digit addition and the generated code handling multi-digit addition."
