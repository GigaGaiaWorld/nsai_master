  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both implementations perform an insertion sort and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The generated code uses slightly different predicate names (insert instead of insert_element) but maintains the same logic and structure. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
