  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally consistent with the original code, maintaining the same predicates and probabilistic rules. However, the probability value for the rule 'inf(X) :- initialInf(X)' was incorrectly set to 0.1 in the generated code, whereas it was implicitly 1.0 in the original code (since it's a deterministic rule with no probability annotation). This discrepancy leads to different inference results. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results due to this error."
