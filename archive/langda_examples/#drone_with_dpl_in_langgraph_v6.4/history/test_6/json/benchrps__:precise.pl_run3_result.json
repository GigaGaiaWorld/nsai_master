  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the given query. The logic for determining the winner in rock-paper-scissors is preserved, including the rules for moves, beats, result calculation, and score computation. The only differences are in formatting and whitespace, which do not affect the code's execution. The generated code maintains all necessary predicates and their relationships correctly."
