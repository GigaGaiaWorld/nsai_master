  "final_report": "The generated code is nearly identical to the original code, maintaining all the same rules, facts, and queries. The only difference is a minor formatting change in the 'abandon' predicate definition, which does not affect the logic or functionality. The generated code correctly implements the probabilistic logic program as specified in the original example. Both codes produce identical results when executed, confirming their functional equivalence."
