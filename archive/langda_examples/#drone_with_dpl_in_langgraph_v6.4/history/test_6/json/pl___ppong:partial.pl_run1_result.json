  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The only difference is in the implementation of the 'team_strength' predicate, where the generated code splits the recursive call into two separate calls for clarity. However, this does not affect the overall behavior or results. Both codes produce identical output probabilities for the query."
