  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, but there are a few issues. First, the generated code uses 'scissors' instead of 'scissor' in the move predicate, which could cause inconsistency. Second, the compute_score rule for 'draw' cases is incorrect as it does not properly compute the score (it misses 'S1'). Despite these issues, the running results are consistent with the original code."
