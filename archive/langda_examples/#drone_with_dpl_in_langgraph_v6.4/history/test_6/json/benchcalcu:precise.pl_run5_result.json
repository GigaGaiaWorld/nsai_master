  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code and produces the same result. However, it contains redundant and repeated clauses (e.g., sumdigit(0, D, E, Y, C1) appears twice, and sumdigit(C3, S, M, O, M) is also repeated). These redundancies do not affect the correctness of the code but make it less clean and efficient. The logic and constraints remain consistent with the original code, ensuring the same solution is found."
