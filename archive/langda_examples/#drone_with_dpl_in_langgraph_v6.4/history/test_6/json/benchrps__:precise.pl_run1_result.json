  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the given query. The logic for determining the winner in rock-paper-scissors remains intact, including the rules for moves, beats, result calculation, and score computation. The main differences are in formatting (extra whitespace and line breaks) and minor syntactic variations (like the placement of line breaks in rule definitions), which do not affect the program's behavior. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
