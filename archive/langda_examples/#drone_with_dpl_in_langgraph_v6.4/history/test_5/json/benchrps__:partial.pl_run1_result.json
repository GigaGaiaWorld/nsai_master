  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the rock-paper-scissors game rules and result calculation. However, there is a minor issue in the `compute_score` clause for `draw` where it incorrectly passes `Rs` instead of `S1` to `S`. Despite this, the running results are consistent with the original code, producing the same output."
