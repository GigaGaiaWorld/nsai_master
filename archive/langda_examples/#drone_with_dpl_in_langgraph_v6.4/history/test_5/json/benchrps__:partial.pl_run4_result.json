  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for draw cases. The original code correctly updates the score with 'S is S1', while the generated code incorrectly uses 'compute_score(Rs, S)' which would cause the score to remain uncalculated. However, this error doesn't affect the final result in this specific test case."
