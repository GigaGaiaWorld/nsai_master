  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it contains syntax errors in the 'game' predicate where variables 'OwnCards' and 'OpponentCards' are used without being properly defined. Second, the code structure is inconsistent with the original, particularly in the handling of card comparisons. These errors lead to a timeout during execution, indicating the code is not functionally correct. The original code runs successfully and produces expected probabilistic outcomes, while the generated code fails to execute."
