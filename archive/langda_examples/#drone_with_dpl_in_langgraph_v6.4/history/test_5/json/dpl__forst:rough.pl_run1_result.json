  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect. It lacks the essential stack operation predicates (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that were present in the original code. The generated code only includes the 'sort' operation and its helper predicates, which are duplicated unnecessarily. As a result, the queries fail to produce the expected results, returning 0.0000 probabilities for all operations. The generated code does not meet the requirements as it cannot perform the basic stack operations that the original code could."
