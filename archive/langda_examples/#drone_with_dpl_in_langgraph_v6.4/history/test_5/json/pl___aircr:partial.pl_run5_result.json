  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main differences are in formatting and minor syntactical adjustments, such as the placement of conditions in some predicates. These changes do not affect the overall behavior of the program. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code correctly implements the intended logic of the original code."
