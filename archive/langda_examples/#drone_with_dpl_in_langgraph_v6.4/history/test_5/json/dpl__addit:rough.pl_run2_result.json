  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that can convert lists of digit images into multi-digit numbers and perform addition on them. This is a valid extension and maintains consistency with the original code's approach. The generated code correctly implements the new functionality, as evidenced by the correct result (79 + 231 = 310) in the run result. Both the form and the result are valid."
