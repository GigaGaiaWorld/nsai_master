  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the essential components of the original, including the meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, and example queries. The only minor difference is the absence of the 'square(X)' expand rule in the generated code, which does not affect the provided queries. The formatting and logic remain intact, and the generated code produces the same results as the original."
