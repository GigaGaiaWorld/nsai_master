  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog but contains several issues. Unlike the original code which successfully sorts the list, the generated code fails due to a syntax error in the conditional statement (->/2) and incorrect handling of the bubble pass. The original code uses a clear swapping mechanism with 'hole' and 'swap' predicates, while the generated code tries to use a boolean flag for swapping but doesn't properly implement it. The generated code is not valid ProbLog syntax and fails to run."
