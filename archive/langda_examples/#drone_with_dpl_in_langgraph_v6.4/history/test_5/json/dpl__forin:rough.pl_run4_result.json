  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally similar to the original code but uses different predicate names ('insert' instead of 'insert_element') and comparison operators ('@=<' and '@>' instead of '=<' and '>'). While the generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements (Validity_form is true), the running result is incorrect. The sorted list [1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7] is not correctly ordered, indicating a logical error in the implementation. This inconsistency makes Validity_result false."
