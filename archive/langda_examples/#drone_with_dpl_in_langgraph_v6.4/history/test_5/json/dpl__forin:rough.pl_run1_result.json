  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally similar to the original code, implementing insertion sort in ProbLog. However, there are two key differences: 1) The predicate name changed from 'insert_element' to 'insert', and 2) The comparison operators changed from '=<' and '>' to '@=<' and '@>'. While the code form is valid, the running result is incorrect as it doesn't produce a properly sorted list, indicating a logical error in the implementation."
