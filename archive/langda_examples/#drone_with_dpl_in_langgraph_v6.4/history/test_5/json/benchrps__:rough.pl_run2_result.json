  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it misses the essential 'result' and 'play' predicates which are crucial for determining the game outcome. The original code includes these predicates to calculate the result of each round and recursively play through the moves. The generated code also redundantly repeats the 'move' and 'beats' declarations. The error message indicates that 'play/3' is unknown, confirming the missing predicates. The generated code fails to produce the same result as the original code due to these omissions."
