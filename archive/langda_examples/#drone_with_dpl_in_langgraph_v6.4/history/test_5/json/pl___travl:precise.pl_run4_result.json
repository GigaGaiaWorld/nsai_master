  "final_report": "The generated code has a typographical error in the predicate 'susceptiple(X)' which should be 'susceptible(X)'. This error causes the code to be invalid as it references an undefined predicate. The structure of the generated code is otherwise consistent with the original code, but the placement of probability annotations differs. In the original code, probabilities are specified at the head of the clauses, while in the generated code, they are placed within the body, which is syntactically incorrect in ProbLog."
