  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there are minor stylistic differences and redundant checks in the 'result' predicate where 'move(X), move(X)' is used instead of just 'move(X)'. The generated code produces the same result as the original code, indicating that the logical flow and calculations are equivalent. The redundancy does not affect the outcome but is unnecessary."
