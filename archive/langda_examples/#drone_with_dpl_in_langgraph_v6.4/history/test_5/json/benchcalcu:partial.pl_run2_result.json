  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally similar to the original code but introduces some logical inconsistencies. The main issue is that it produces multiple solutions (including the correct one from the original code) rather than a unique solution. This suggests the constraints in the generated code are not as strict as in the original, allowing for more permutations. The generated code is valid in form but fails to maintain the original's strict uniqueness requirement."
