  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it introduces undefined variables 'OwnCards' and 'OpponentCards' in the 'game(Cards,House,Outcome)' clause, which were not properly passed from the previous clauses. Second, the structure of the 'game' predicates is inconsistent with the original code, leading to a runtime error. The generated code fails to execute properly, unlike the original code which produces valid results."
