  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm and produce the same correct result when sorting the list [3,1,2,5,7,12]. However, the generated code has some formatting issues, such as unnecessary line breaks and inconsistent indentation, which do not affect the functionality but make the code less readable. The logic and structure of the generated code remain intact and match the original code."
