  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of parsing logic. The original code handles operator precedence correctly by processing multiplication and division immediately, while the generated code processes operators left-to-right without considering precedence. This leads to different results for the same input. The generated code is syntactically valid but produces incorrect results due to the flawed parsing approach."
