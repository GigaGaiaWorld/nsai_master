  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct but contains some inconsistencies with the original code. Specifically, the positions of some attributes in the house predicates are swapped (e.g., 'dog' and 'snail' are in different positions). Despite these inconsistencies, the generated code still produces a valid solution to the zebra puzzle, as evidenced by the run result. The result is consistent with the original code's output, indicating that the logical constraints are effectively the same even if the attribute positions differ."
