  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but introduces syntax errors and logical inconsistencies. The main issue is in the 'open_door' predicate where it incorrectly uses '->/2' operator without proper context, leading to a runtime error. The original code correctly handles door opening probabilities and deterministic cases separately. The generated code fails to execute due to these syntax issues, making it invalid. The results cannot be consistent since the generated code doesn't run successfully."
