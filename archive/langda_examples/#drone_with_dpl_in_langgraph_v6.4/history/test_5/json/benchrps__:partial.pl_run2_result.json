  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the rock-paper-scissors game rules and result calculation. However, there is a minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for 'draw' cases where it incorrectly passes 'Rs' instead of 'S1' to the next recursion, which could lead to incorrect score calculations in some scenarios. Despite this, the provided test case produces the same result as the original code."
