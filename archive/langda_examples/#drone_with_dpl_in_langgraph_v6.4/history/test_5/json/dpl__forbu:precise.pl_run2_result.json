  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same sorting result for the given input. The main difference lies in the implementation of the swap/3 predicate, where the generated code uses 'X > Y' and 'X =< Y' conditions instead of the original 'X < Y' and '\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)'. This change is logically equivalent and does not affect the outcome. The structure and logic of the sorting algorithm remain consistent between both versions."
