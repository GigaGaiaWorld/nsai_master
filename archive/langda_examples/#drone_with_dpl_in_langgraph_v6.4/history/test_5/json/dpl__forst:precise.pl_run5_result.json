  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sort operation. The main difference is in the implementation of the sort operation: the original code uses a custom insertion_sort predicate, while the generated code uses the built-in sort predicate. However, both implementations achieve the same result for the given queries. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
