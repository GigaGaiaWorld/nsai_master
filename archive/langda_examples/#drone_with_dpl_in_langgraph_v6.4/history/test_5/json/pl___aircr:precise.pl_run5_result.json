  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference is in the formatting and minor syntactic adjustments, such as the placement of conditions in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate. However, these changes do not affect the overall behavior or results of the program. Both codes produce identical inference results, indicating that the generated code correctly implements the intended logic of the original code."
