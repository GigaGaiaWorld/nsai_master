  "final_report": "The generated code is missing the deterministic rule 'inf(X) :- initialInf(X).' which is present in the original code. This omission significantly affects the probability calculations, leading to different results. The generated code is otherwise consistent with the original code in terms of structure and probabilistic rules. The difference in results (0.1245 vs 0.0212) is due to the missing rule, which plays a crucial role in the original model."
