Both codes define the same rules for rock-paper-scissors, calculate game results, compute scores, and determine the winner in the same manner. The generated code maintains the same structure and logic as the original, with only minor formatting differences such as spacing and line breaks. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
