  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code. The logic and structure are preserved, with only minor formatting differences and a slight reorganization of conditions in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate. The generated code correctly maintains all the probabilistic rules and queries, producing identical results to the original code."
