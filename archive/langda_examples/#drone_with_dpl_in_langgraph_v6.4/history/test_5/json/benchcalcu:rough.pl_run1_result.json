  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally different from the original code. While both aim to solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle SEND + MORE = MONEY, the original code uses a step-by-step approach with carry propagation (sumdigit predicates), while the generated code attempts to solve it by directly converting letters to digits and checking the equation. The generated code is valid in form but fails to produce the correct result (returns 0.0000 probability), indicating it doesn't properly constrain the problem. The original code successfully finds the correct solution with probability 1.0000."
