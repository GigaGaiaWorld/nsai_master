  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect. It lacks the definitions for basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that were present in the original code. The generated code only includes the sort operation and get_top_n predicate, but these are duplicated unnecessarily. As a result, the queries fail with 0.0000 probability because the required predicates are missing. The generated code does not meet expectations as it cannot perform any of the stack operations that the original code could."
