  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it introduces a new variable C4 which is not properly handled in the sumdigit predicate, leading to a runtime error. Second, the constraint C4 = 0 is misplaced and should be integrated into the sumdigit predicate. The original code correctly handles the carry and constraints, while the generated code fails to do so. The generated code is not valid as it results in a runtime error."
