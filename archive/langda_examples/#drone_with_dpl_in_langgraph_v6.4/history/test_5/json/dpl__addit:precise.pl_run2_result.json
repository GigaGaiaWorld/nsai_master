  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle multi-digit numbers and 'multi_addition' to perform addition on these numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly computes the sum of two multi-digit numbers represented as lists of images. The running results are consistent with the expected behavior, demonstrating that the generated code works as intended."
