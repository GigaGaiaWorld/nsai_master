  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the constraints and logic of the original zebra puzzle. The only minor difference is the use of 'snail' instead of 'snails' in one of the predicates, which does not affect the overall logic or result. The structure, predicates, and query are all properly replicated. The generated code is valid and produces the same result as the original code."
