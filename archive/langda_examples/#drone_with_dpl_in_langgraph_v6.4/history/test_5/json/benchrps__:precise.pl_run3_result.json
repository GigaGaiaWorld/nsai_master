  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is an issue in the 'result' predicate where it unnecessarily checks 'move(Y)' and 'X == Y', which is redundant since the original code already handles this case more efficiently. Despite this, the generated code produces the same result as the original code when executed."
