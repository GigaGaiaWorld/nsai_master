  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define digit facts and an addition rule that sums the values of two digits. The generated code uses different variable names (A, B) instead of (X2, Y2), but this does not affect the logic or outcome. The query and the result are identical in both cases, producing the correct sum of 11 for the addition of img_5 and img_6."
