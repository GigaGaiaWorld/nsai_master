  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define digit facts and an addition rule that sums the digits of two images. The generated code uses different variable names (A, B instead of X2, Y2) but this does not affect the logic or outcome. The formatting of the generated code is slightly different with line breaks and spacing, but this is syntactically acceptable in Prolog. Both codes produce identical results when queried."
