  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. Both codes handle base cases and recursive sorting with merging. The generated code uses a different splitting approach ('split/3') compared to the original's 'split_list/3', but both achieve the same goal of dividing the list into two halves. The merging logic is identical in both codes. The generated code is valid and produces the same correct sorting result as the original code."
