  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid as it produces an error during execution. The main issue is in the 'parse' predicate where it attempts to use an '->' operator incorrectly, leading to an 'UnknownClause' error. The original code correctly handles operator precedence and negative numbers through separate clauses for each operator, while the generated code tries to handle all operators in a single clause without proper precedence handling. The generated code also lacks the 'almost_equal' checks present in the original."
