  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. Both codes define the same probabilistic rules and facts, with only a minor reordering of the rules. The generated code maintains the same logic and structure, ensuring identical inference results. The running results for both codes are exactly the same, confirming their equivalence."
