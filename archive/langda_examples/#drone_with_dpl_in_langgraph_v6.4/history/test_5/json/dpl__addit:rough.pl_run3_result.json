  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of digit images into their corresponding numerical values and performs addition on these numbers. This is a valid extension of the original code's concept. The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements of performing arithmetic operations on digit representations. The result (310) correctly corresponds to the addition of 79 and 231, demonstrating that the code works as intended."
