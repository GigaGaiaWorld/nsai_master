  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. However, there is a significant difference in the implementation of 'implies/2'. The original code allows the implication to be true if either P is unprovable or Q is provable, while the generated code requires both P and Q to be provable. This change affects the logical meaning of 'implies/2'. Despite this difference, the running results are consistent for the given queries because the specific queries used happen to satisfy both implementations."
