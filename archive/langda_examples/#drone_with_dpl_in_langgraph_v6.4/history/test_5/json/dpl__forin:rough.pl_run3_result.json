  "final_report": "The generated code is valid in form and follows a similar structure to the original code, using an accumulator for the insertion sort. However, the running result is incorrect as it does not produce a sorted list. The issue lies in the 'insert' predicate where the comparison operators '@=<' and '@>' are used instead of '=<' and '>', leading to incorrect element ordering. The original code correctly sorts the list, while the generated code does not."
