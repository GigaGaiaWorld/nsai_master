  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it introduces undefined variables 'OwnCards' and 'OpponentCards' in the 'game(Cards,House,Outcome)' clause, which were not present in the original code. Second, the structure of the 'game' predicates has been altered, leading to logical inconsistencies. These changes cause the code to fail during execution, as evidenced by the timeout error. The generated code does not maintain the same functionality as the original code."
