  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main differences are in formatting and minor syntactical adjustments, such as the placement of line breaks and comments. The core logic, including the definitions of predicates, probabilistic rules, and queries, remains unchanged. The generated code correctly implements the aircraft flap controller model and produces the same results as the original code when executed."
