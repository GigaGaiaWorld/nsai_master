  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. The main difference is in the 'split' function, where the generated code uses a different approach to split the list into two halves. The generated code's 'split' function directly splits the list by alternating elements, while the original code calculates the length and splits accordingly. Both implementations produce the same correct result for the given query. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
