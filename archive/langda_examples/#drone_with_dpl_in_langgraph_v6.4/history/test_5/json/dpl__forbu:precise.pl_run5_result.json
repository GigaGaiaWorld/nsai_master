  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same sorting result for the given input. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'swap' predicate, where the generated code uses 'X > Y' and 'X =< Y' instead of the original 'X < Y' and '\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)'. This change is logically equivalent and does not affect the outcome. The formatting of the generated code is slightly less consistent, with an unnecessary line break in the 'bubblesort' clause, but this does not impact functionality."
