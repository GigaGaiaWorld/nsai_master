  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect. It lacks the definitions for basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that were present in the original code. The generated code only includes the sort operation and get_top_n predicate, but these are duplicated unnecessarily. As a result, the queries fail with probability 0.0000 for all operations, which is inconsistent with the original code's correct results."
