  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the definition of the swap/3 predicate: the original code uses '<' and '\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)', while the generated code uses '>' and '=<'. This change does not affect the logic or the outcome of the sorting process."
