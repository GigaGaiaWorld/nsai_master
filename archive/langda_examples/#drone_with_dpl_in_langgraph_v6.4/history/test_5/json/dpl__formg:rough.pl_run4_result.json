  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. Both codes handle base cases and recursive sorting with merging. The main difference is in the 'split' function implementation: the original uses length and append, while the generated code uses pattern matching for splitting. This change makes the generated code more efficient but maintains the same functionality. Both produce identical results for the given query."
