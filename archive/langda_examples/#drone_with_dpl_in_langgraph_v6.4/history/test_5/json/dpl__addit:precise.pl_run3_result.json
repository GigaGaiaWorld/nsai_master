  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of images into their corresponding numerical values and then performs addition. This is a valid extension of the original concept, which only handled single-digit addition. The generated code is consistent with the original in terms of using digit/2 facts and performing arithmetic operations. The result is correct, showing that 79 + 312 equals 391."
