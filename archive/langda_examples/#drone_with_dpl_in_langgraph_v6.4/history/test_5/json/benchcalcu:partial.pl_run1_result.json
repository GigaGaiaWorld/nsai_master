  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. It introduces several issues compared to the original code. First, it incorrectly places the digit(M) constraint before digit(S), which should be a leftdigit. Second, the sumdigit(C4, 0, 0, M, 0) line is problematic as it attempts to perform arithmetic with unbound variables, leading to the CallModeError. The original code correctly structures the constraints and arithmetic operations to solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle."
