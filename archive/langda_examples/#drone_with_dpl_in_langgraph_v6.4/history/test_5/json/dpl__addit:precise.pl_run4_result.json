  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The generated code is valid and correctly implements the extended functionality, as evidenced by the correct result (79 + 312 = 391). While the generated code is more complex than the original, it maintains consistency with the original's approach of using digit predicates and arithmetic operations."
