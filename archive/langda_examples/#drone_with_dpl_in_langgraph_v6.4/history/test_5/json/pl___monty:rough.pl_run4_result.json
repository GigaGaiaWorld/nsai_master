  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but contains a syntax error in the 'open_door' predicate, specifically with the conditional operator '->' which is not properly formatted. This causes the code to be invalid and results in an error during execution. The original code correctly implements the problem with proper probability distributions and conditions for opening doors, winning by keeping the initial choice, and winning by switching. The generated code fails to produce the expected results due to its invalid syntax."
