  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of images into their corresponding numerical values and then performs addition. This is a valid extension of the original concept, maintaining consistency with the original code's approach while adding more complex number handling. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as demonstrated by the successful execution that correctly adds 79 and 312 to get 391."
