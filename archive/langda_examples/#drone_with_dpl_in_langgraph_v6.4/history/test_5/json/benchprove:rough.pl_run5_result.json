  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The main issue lies in the implementation of the 'implies' predicate. The original code correctly implements 'implies(P,Q)' as 'P ⇒ Q', which succeeds when P is unprovable or Q is provable. However, the generated code incorrectly implements it as 'prove(A), prove(B)', which is equivalent to 'A ∧ B'. This change affects the logical meaning and results in incorrect query outcomes. Additionally, the generated code lacks implementations for 'opposite', 'includes', and 'extend' predicates, leading to incorrect results for those queries."
