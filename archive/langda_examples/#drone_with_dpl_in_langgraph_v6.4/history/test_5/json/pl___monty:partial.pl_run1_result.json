  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem with the same probabilistic rules and queries. The generated code has minor formatting differences and uses 'A \\= B' instead of 'A < B' in the first open_door rule, but this does not affect the logic or results. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
