  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. Both codes produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference is in the 'split' function implementation - the generated code uses a different approach that splits the list by alternating elements, while the original splits at the midpoint. Despite this difference, both implementations correctly divide the list for sorting. The merge function and base cases are identical in both implementations."
