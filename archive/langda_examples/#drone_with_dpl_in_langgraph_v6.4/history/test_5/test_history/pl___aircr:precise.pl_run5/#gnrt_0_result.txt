Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5BCD04E8", "Code": "flap_position(Prev, Old),\ngoal(GP),\nOld \\= GP,\nuse_actuator(Time, A),\nactuator_strength(A, AS),\nAE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,\nwind_effect(Time, WE),\nPos is Old + AE + WE."}
```

This code block implements all the requirements specified in the placeholder:
1. Gets the previous flap position (Old)
2. Checks if Old is not the goal position (GP)
3. Selects an actuator (A)
4. Gets the actuator strength (AS)
5. Calculates the ideal movement (AE)
6. Gets wind effect (WE)
7. Computes the new position (Pos) by combining Old, AE and WE
