Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks that correspond to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).\nstack_op(pop, [X|Stack], Stack).\nstack_op(dup, [X|Stack], [X,X|Stack]).\nstack_op(swap, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X|Stack]).\nstack_op(over, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X,Y|Stack]).\nstack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Stack], [Y,Z,X|Stack])."}
```

This JSON object contains:
1. The HASH value "5E40E418" from the origin_code
2. The completed code snippet that implements the series of stack operations as required in the origin_code's <Requirements> tag

Note that the other parts of the generated_code were either already present in the origin_code or were not marked with <langda> tags, so they weren't included in the extraction.
