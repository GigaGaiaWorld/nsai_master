Here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the original code:

```problog
{"HASH": "1039E900", "Code": "digit(O), all_different([O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C2, E, O, N, C3),\n\ndigit(M), all_different([M,O,R,N,Y,E,D]),\nsumdigit(C3, S, M, O, C4),\n\nleftdigit(S), all_different([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]),\nC4 = 0."}
```

This is the only code block that was needed to complete the original code where the <langda> placeholder was located. The block completes the predicate logic by:
1. Adding constraints for digit O
2. Adding constraints for digit M
3. Ensuring S is a left digit (non-zero)
4. Setting the final carry (C4) to 0
5. Maintaining all_different constraints throughout
