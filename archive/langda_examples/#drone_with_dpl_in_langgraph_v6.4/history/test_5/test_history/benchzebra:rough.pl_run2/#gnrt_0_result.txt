Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the completed code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code.

The <langda> block in origin_code indicates a missing rule completion, and looking at the generated_code, the completed version would include the missing rule between the Spanish house and yellow house conditions.

Here's the extracted and formatted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43","Code": "my_member(house(green, _, _, coffee, _), Houses),"}
```

This completes the rule between the Spanish house and yellow house conditions in the original code, maintaining the zebra puzzle's logical constraints. The hash matches the one specified in the <langda> block's <HASH> tag.
