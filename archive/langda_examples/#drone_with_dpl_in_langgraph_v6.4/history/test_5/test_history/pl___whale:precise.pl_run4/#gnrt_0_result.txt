Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> placeholder in the origin_code.

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE","Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)."}
```

This is the only code block that was generated to replace the <Langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The code implements the requirement specified in the placeholder: it defines when the adult sperm whale (ID 2) abandons the calf based on the genders of the adult sperm whale (S) and orca (O), and the position of the adult sperm whale being at c.
