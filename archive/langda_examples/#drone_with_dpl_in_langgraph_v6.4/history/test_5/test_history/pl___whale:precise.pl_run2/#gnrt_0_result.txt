Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, here's the extracted and formatted code block that corresponds to the <Langda> placeholder:

```problog
{"HASH": "A90B08DE", "Code": "abandon(S,O) :- gender(2,S), gender(3,O), position(2,c)."}
```

This is the only code block that was generated to replace the <Langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The code implements the requirement that when the adult sperm whale (ID 2) is of gender S, the orca (ID 3) is of gender O, and the adult sperm whale is at position c, it means the adult sperm whale abandons the calf.
