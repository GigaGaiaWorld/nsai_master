Here's the extracted and formatted code block from the generated code that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "5BCD04E8", "Code": "flap_position(Prev, Old),\ngoal(GP),\nOld \\= GP,\nuse_actuator(Time, A),\nactuator_strength(A, AS),\nAE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,\nwind_effect(Time, WE),\nPos is Old + AE + WE."}
```

This code block implements all the requirements specified in the <Langda> placeholder:
1. Gets the previous flap position (Old)
2. Checks if Old is already the goal (GP)
3. Selects an actuator (A)
4. Gets the actuator strength (AS)
5. Uses the goal position (GP = 4)
6. Calculates ideal movement (AE)
7. Gets wind effect (WE)
8. Calculates new position (Pos) by combining Old, AE and WE
