Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code corresponding to the <langda> blocks in the origin code:

```problog
{"HASH": "E659D458", "Code": "stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "6931D64E", "Code": "sort([X,Y,Z|Stack], [A,B,C|Stack]) :- sort0([X,Y,Z], [A,B,C])."}
```

The first code block implements the push operation that adds an element to the top of the stack, while the second implements the custom sort operation that sorts the top three elements of the stack. Both match their respective hash tags and requirements from the origin code.
