Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> placeholder in the origin_code. Since the generated_code section appears to be empty in your input, I'll provide the completed code that would logically fill the <Langda> placeholder based on the requirements.

Here's the formatted JSON for the completed code block:

```problog
{
  "HASH": "CD409C7B",
  "Code": "member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, spanish, dog, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(green, _, _, coffee, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, ukrainian, _, tea, _), Houses),\nright_of(house(green, _, _, _, _), house(ivory, _, _, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, snail, _, winstons), Houses),\nmember(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),\nHouses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _, _],\nHouses = [house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)|_],\nnext_to(house(_, _, _, _, chesterfields), house(_, _, fox, _, _), Houses),\nnext_to(house(_, _, _, _, kools), house(_, _, horse, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes), Houses),\nmember(house(_, japanese, _, _, parliaments), Houses),\nnext_to(house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), house(blue, _, _, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses),\nmember(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)"
}
```

This code implements all the constraints specified in the requirements section of the <Langda> placeholder, including:
- House colors and nationalities
- Pets and drinks
- Smoking preferences
- Positional relationships between houses
- The final conditions about the zebra and water drinker
