Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code.

The origin_code had one <langda> block with hash CFA63C1E, which was requesting the definition of game rules for rock-paper-scissors. In the generated_code, this corresponds to the basic rules section at the top.

Here's the extracted code in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E","Code": "% Three gestures\nmove(rock).\nmove(paper).\nmove(scissor).\n% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y\nbeats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(scissor, paper).\nbeats(paper, rock)."}
```

Note that this is the only code block that was marked as a placeholder in the origin_code (with the <langda> tag). The other parts of the code were already complete in the origin_code.
