Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, there is only one <Langda> block that needs to be completed. Here's the extracted and formatted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```

This corresponds to the placeholder in the origin_code where the rule about the yellow house with Kools cigarettes needed to be completed. The generated_code shows this line was added to complete the logic puzzle constraints.
