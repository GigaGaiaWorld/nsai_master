Based on the origin_code and generated_code provided, there is only one <Langda> block in the origin_code that needs to be completed. Here's the extracted and formatted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "0F506A43", "Code": "my_member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses)"}
```

This corresponds to the line that was missing in the origin_code (marked by the <Langda> block) and appears in the generated_code. The hash tag matches the one provided in the <Langda> block, and the code completes the rule as required.
