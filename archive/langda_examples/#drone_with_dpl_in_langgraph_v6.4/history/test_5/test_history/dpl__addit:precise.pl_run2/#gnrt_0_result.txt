Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks from the generated code corresponding to the <langda> blocks in the origin_code:

```problog
{"HASH": "6579E7BA", "Code": "number([H|T], Acc, Result) :- digit(H, Nr), NewAcc is Acc * 10 + Nr, number(T, NewAcc, Result)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A", "Code": "multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,0,X1), number(Y,0,Y1), Z is X1 + Y1."}
```

These code snippets:
1. Complete the number/3 predicate to process digit images recursively
2. Implement the multi_addition predicate to parse image lists into numbers and add them
