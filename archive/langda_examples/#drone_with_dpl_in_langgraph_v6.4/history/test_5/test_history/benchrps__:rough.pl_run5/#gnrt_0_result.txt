Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> placeholder in the origin_code. The placeholder was for defining the game rules of rock-paper-scissors, which appears to be the first part of the generated code.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "% Three gestures\nmove(rock).\nmove(paper).\nmove(scissor).\n% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y\nbeats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(scissor, paper).\nbeats(paper, rock)."}
```

Note that this is the only code block that was marked with a <langda> placeholder in the origin_code, and it corresponds to the basic game rules section at the top of the generated code. The hash value comes from the <HASH> tag in the origin_code's placeholder.
