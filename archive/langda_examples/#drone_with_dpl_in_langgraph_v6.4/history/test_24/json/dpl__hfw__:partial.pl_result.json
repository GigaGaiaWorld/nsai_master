  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and structure. Both codes correctly define the predicates for detecting numbers and operators, parsing expressions, and evaluating arithmetic operations. The generated code maintains the same logic for handling subtraction by converting it into addition with a negative value, which is a clever approach. The only minor issue is the formatting inconsistency in the 'detect_all' predicate where the line breaks and indentation are not perfectly aligned, but this does not affect the functionality. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the correct output for the given query."
