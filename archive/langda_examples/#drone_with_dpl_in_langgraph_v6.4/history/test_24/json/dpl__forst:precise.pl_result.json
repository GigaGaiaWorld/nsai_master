  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, there is a syntax error with an extra period after the first stack_op(push(X)) rule, causing a parse error. Second, the sort operation is defined twice with different implementations, which is redundant and confusing. The helper predicate sort3 is correctly implemented but not used in the first sort definition. The original code uses insertion_sort for sorting, while the generated code uses a custom sort3 predicate. The generated code would produce consistent results with the original if the syntax errors were fixed and the sort operation was properly implemented."
