However, there are formatting issues, particularly with the line breaks and indentation in the 'overrun_exception' rule, which causes a parsing error ('Expected binary operator'). This makes the generated code invalid. The original code runs successfully and produces expected results, while the generated code fails to execute due to syntax errors."
