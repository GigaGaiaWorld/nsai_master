  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a critical error in the 'compute_score' predicate for the 'draw' case. The generated code incorrectly uses 'compute_score(Rs, S)' instead of 'compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1', which means it does not properly maintain the score for draw results. Despite this, the running results are consistent with the original code for the given query, as the error does not affect the specific test case provided."
