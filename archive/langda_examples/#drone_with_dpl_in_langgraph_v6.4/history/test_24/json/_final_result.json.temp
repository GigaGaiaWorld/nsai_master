It maintains the same functionality for member/2, basic meta-interpreter, and extended logic processing. However, there is a notable difference in the 'implies/2' implementation: the original code succeeds if P is unprovable OR Q is provable, while the generated code requires both P and Q to be provable. Despite this difference, the running results are consistent for the given queries, as the specific test case for 'implies/2' happens to satisfy both implementations."
