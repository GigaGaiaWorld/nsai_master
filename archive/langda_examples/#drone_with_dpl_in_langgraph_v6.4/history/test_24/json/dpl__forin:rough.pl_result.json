  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, similar to the original code. Both versions produce the same sorted output for the given input. The generated code uses an accumulator pattern, which is a common optimization in Prolog-style languages, making it slightly more efficient. The logic and functionality remain consistent with the original code. No problems were identified in the generated code."
