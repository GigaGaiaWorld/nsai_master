  "final_report": "The generated code extends the functionality of the original code by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of images into multi-digit numbers and performs addition. The code is valid and correctly implements the described functionality. The result shows it correctly adds 79 and 312 to get 391, demonstrating consistency with the original code's logic but with enhanced capability."
