  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference lies in the formatting and minor syntactic variations, such as the placement of commas and spaces. The generated code correctly maintains the probabilistic rules and queries, and the running results are identical to those of the original code. No functional discrepancies or problems were found."
