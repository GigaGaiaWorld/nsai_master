  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of parsing logic. The original code handles operator precedence correctly by using recursive parsing for multiplication and division, while the generated code processes operations in a left-associative manner without considering precedence. This leads to incorrect results, as seen in the run result where the generated code produces 11.666... instead of -10.333... for the same query."
