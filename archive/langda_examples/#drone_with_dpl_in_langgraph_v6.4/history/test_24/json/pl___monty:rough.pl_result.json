  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error in the 'open_door' rule, specifically at line 6:25 where a binary operator was expected. This prevents the code from running successfully. The original code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem with proper probability distributions and rules for door selection and opening. The generated code attempts to simplify the 'open_door' rule but introduces a syntax error, making it invalid. The running results cannot be compared because the generated code fails to execute."
