  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there is a syntax error in the generated code due to an extra period (.) at the end of the 'query_sum' predicate, which causes a parsing error. The logic for digit constraints, sum calculations, and uniqueness checks remains correct. The error prevents the generated code from running successfully, unlike the original code which produces valid results."
