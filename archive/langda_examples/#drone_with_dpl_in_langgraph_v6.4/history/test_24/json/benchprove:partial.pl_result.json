  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The only differences are minor formatting changes and the removal of some comments, which do not affect the code's behavior. The generated code maintains all the essential components of the original code, including the meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, examples, and queries. The running results of both pieces of code are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expectations."
