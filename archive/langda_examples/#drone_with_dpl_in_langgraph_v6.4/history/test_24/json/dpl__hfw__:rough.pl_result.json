  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect compared to the original code. It lacks several crucial parsing rules for different operators (-, *, /) and only includes a simplified addition case. This results in the inability to properly evaluate the given expression, leading to an incorrect result (0.0000) instead of the expected -10.333333333333332. The generated code's form is valid Prolog syntax but does not meet the functional requirements of the original code."
