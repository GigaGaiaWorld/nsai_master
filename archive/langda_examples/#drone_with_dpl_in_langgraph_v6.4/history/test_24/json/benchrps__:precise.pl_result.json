  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there is a syntax error in the generated code where the '->' operator is incorrectly used in the determine_winner predicate, leading to a runtime error. The original code uses semicolons for disjunction, which is correct. The generated code also changes the output labels ('player1' to 'Player 1', etc.), which is a minor inconsistency but not functionally incorrect."
