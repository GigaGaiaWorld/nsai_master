**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup**: The prize is equally likely to be behind any of the three doors (`prize/1`), and the contestant selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
2. **Host Behavior**:
   - If two unselected doors are empty, the host randomly opens one (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).
   - If only one unselected door is empty, the host opens it with certainty (`open_door(A)`).
3. **Winning Conditions**:
   - `win_keep`: The contestant wins by sticking with their initial choice.
   - `win_switch`: The contestant wins by switching to the remaining unopened door.
4. **Queries**: The code queries the probabilities of the prize location, the initial selection, and the winning strategies.
