System: You are a coding assistant. You MUST use the available tools to complete the ProbLog code. Do not attempt to solve the problem without using tools.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 501F546D </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

</Code>
<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

<Langda> Information:

% Insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog
insertion_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    i_sort(List, [], Sorted).

% Base case: when the input list is empty, the accumulator is the sorted list
i_sort([], Acc, Acc).

% Recursive case: insert the head of the list into the accumulator and continue
i_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    insert(H, Acc, NewAcc),
    i_sort(T, NewAcc, Sorted).

% Insert an element into a sorted list
insert(X, [], [X]).

insert(X, [Y|T], [X,Y|T]) :-
    X =< Y.

insert(X, [Y|T], [Y|NewT]) :-
    X > Y,
    insert(X, T, NewT).

% Example query
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).

<generated_code>
<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
</Final_Answer>

**FIRST RESULT:
Based on the retrieved information, I will implement an interpretable `insertion_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog. The algorithm will follow the traditional insertion sort approach, adapted to ProbLog's syntax and capabilities.

Here is the completed code:

```problog
% Insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog
insertion_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    i_sort(List, [], Sorted).

% Base case: when the input list is empty, the accumulator is the sorted list
i_sort([], Acc, Acc).

% Recursive case: insert the head of the list into the accumulator and continue
i_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    insert(H, Acc, NewAcc),
    i_sort(T, NewAcc, Sorted).

% Insert an element into a sorted list
insert(X, [], [X]).

insert(X, [Y|T], [X,Y|T]) :-
    X =< Y.

insert(X, [Y|T], [Y|NewT]) :-
    X > Y,
    insert(X, T, NewT).

% Example query
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```

### Explanation:
1. **`insertion_sort/2`**:
   - Takes an unsorted list and returns the sorted list.
   - Uses the helper predicate `i_sort/3` with an accumulator.

2. **`i_sort/3`**:
   - Recursively processes the input list, inserting each element into the accumulator (which is initially empty).
   - When the input list is empty, the accumulator is the sorted list.

3. **`insert/3`**:
   - Inserts an element into a sorted list while maintaining the sorted order.
   - Compares the element with the head of the list and places it in the correct position.

4. **Example Query**:
   - The query `insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` will return `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`.

This implementation is interpretable and follows the standard insertion sort logic, adapted for ProbLog.
