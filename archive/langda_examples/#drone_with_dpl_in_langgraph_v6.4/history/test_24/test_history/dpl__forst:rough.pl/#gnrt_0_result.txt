Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code.

The origin_code contains a <langda> block with hash 5E40E418, but the generated_code section is empty (just contains the template). Since there's no corresponding completed code in the generated_code section, I'll return an empty result for this hash:

```problog
{"HASH": "5E40E418", "Code": ""}
```
