In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
</Final_Answer>

**FIRST RESULT:
The provided information indicates that ProbLog does not have built-in predicates for character manipulation or adjacency checks like those in Prolog. However, we can implement the `bb(N)` predicate as described in the requirements by iterating over the positions and checking for adjacent `b` characters.

Here is the completed ProbLog code:

```problog
0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N, b).

% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
    palindrome(1, N).

% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A, B) :-
    A > B.

% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N, N) :-
    pick(N, _).

% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A, B) :-
    A < B,
    pick(A, X),
    pick(B, X),
    AA is A + 1,
    BB is B - 1,
    palindrome(AA, BB).

% Check for adjacent 'b' characters in a string of length N
bb(N) :-
    Max is N - 1,
    between(1, Max, I),
    pick(I, b),
    J is I + 1,
    pick(J, b).

len(5).
evidence(palindrome(X)) :- len(X).
query(bb(X)) :- len(X).
```

### Explanation:
1. **`bb(N)` Predicate**:
   - `Max is N - 1` calculates the maximum starting position to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
   - `between(1, Max, I)` iterates over each position `I` from 1 to `Max`.
   - `pick(I, b)` checks if the character at position `I` is `b`.
   - `J is I + 1` and `pick(J, b)` check if the next position `J` also has `b`.
   - If any such pair is found, `bb(N)` succeeds.

2. **Other Predicates**:
   - The `palindrome` predicates remain unchanged.
   - `len(5)` defines the string length.
   - `evidence(palindrome(X))` and `query(bb(X))` are used for inference.
