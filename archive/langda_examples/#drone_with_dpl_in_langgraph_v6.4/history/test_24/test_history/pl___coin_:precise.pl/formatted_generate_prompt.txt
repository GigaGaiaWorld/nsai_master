In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
</Final_Answer>

**FIRST RESULT:
Based on the requirements and the provided code snippet, the task is to complete the recursive predicate `coins_r/3` in ProbLog. The predicate should simulate flipping a coin `CNT` times, where each coin flip has a probability of 0.8 of landing heads. The success count `SC` should increase by 1 for each heads, and the final count should be accumulated into `S`.

Here is the completed ProbLog code:

```problog
PH::make_coin(C, PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).

coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    ( coin(CNT) ->
        SC1 is SC + 1,
        coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1)
    ;
        coins_r(SC, S, CNT1)
    ).

total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).
```

### Explanation:
1. **`make_coin/2` and `coin/1`**: These predicates define a probabilistic coin with a probability of 0.8 for heads.
2. **`coins_r/3`**:
   - Base case: When `CNT` is 0, the success count `SC` is returned as `S`.
   - Recursive case: For `CNT > 0`, the counter is decremented (`CNT1`). If the current coin (`CNT`) lands heads (`coin(CNT)`), the success count `SC` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, it remains unchanged. The predicate then recurses with the updated values.
3. **`total/1`**: Initializes the recursive predicate with `SC = 0` and `CNT = 4`.
4. **`query(total(_))`**: Queries the probability distribution of the total number of heads after flipping 4 coins.

This code adheres to the requirements and uses ProbLog's syntax for probabilistic reasoning.
