**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
</Final_Answer>

**FIRST RESULT:
Here is the completed ProbLog code for the merge sort implementation based on your requirements:

```problog
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    split_list(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

split_list(List, Left, Right) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Half is Len // 2,
    length(Left, Half),
    append(Left, Right, List).

merge([], List, List).
merge(List, [], List).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H1|Merged]) :-
    H1 =< H2,
    merge(T1, [H2|T2], Merged).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H2|Merged]) :-
    H1 > H2,
    merge([H1|T1], T2, Merged).

append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
    append(T, L2, R).

query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```

### Explanation:
1. **Boundary Conditions**: The first two rules handle the base cases where the list is empty or has a single element.
2. **Recursive Splitting**: The `merge_sort` predicate checks the length of the list (`Len > 1`) and splits it into two halves (`Left` and `Right`) using `split_list`.
3. **Recursive Sorting**: The left and right halves are recursively sorted (`merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft)` and `merge_sort(Right, SortedRight)`).
4. **Merging**: The sorted halves are merged using the `merge` predicate.
5. **Helper Predicates**: `split_list` splits the list, and `merge` combines two sorted lists into one.

The query at the end demonstrates the sorting of the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`.
