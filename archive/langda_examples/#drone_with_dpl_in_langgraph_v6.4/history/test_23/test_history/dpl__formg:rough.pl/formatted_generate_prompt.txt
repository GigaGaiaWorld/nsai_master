System: You are a coding assistant. Use the tools as needed to complete the ProbLog code.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

% Base case: an empty list or a single-element list is already sorted

merge_sort([X], [X]).

% Recursive case: split the list into two halves, sort each half, and merge them
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    List = [_, _ | _], % Ensure the list has at least two elements
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),

% Split the list into two halves
split([], [], []).
split([X], [X], []).
split([X, Y | Tail], [X | Left], [Y | Right]) :-
    split(Tail, Left, Right).

% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X | Left], [Y | Right], [X | Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Left, [Y | Right], Merged).
merge([X | Left], [Y | Right], [Y | Merged]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X | Left], Right, Merged).

% Helper predicate for appending lists (already provided)
append([], L, L).

<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
</Final_Answer>

**FIRST RESULT:
Here is the completed Problog code for an interpretable `merge_sort/2` algorithm, based on the provided requirements and the given partial code:

```problog
% Base case: an empty list or a single-element list is already sorted
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).

% Recursive case: split the list into two halves, sort each half, and merge them
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    List = [_, _ | _], % Ensure the list has at least two elements
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

% Split the list into two halves
split([], [], []).
split([X], [X], []).
split([X, Y | Tail], [X | Left], [Y | Right]) :-
    split(Tail, Left, Right).

% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X | Left], [Y | Right], [X | Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Left, [Y | Right], Merged).
merge([X | Left], [Y | Right], [Y | Merged]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X | Left], Right, Merged).

% Helper predicate for appending lists (already provided)
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
    append(T, L2, R).

% Query example
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Cases**: 
   - An empty list or a single-element list is already sorted.
2. **Recursive Case**:
   - The list is split into two halves (`Left` and `Right`).
   - Each half is recursively sorted.
   - The sorted halves are merged back together.
3. **Split**:
   - The `split/3` predicate divides the list into two roughly equal parts.
4. **Merge**:
   - The `merge/3` predicate combines two sorted lists into one sorted list by comparing the smallest elements of each list.
5. **Query**:
   - The example query `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` demonstrates the sorting of the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`. The result will be bound to `X`.

This code is interpretable and follows the standard merge sort algorithm. Let me know if you'd like any modifications or additional explanations!
