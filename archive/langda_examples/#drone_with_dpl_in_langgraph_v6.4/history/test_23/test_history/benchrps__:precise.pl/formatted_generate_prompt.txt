### Explanation:
1. **`compute_score/2`**:
   - Handles the score calculation for `win`, `lose`, and `draw` cases as specified.
   - For `lose`, it subtracts 1 from the score (equivalent to adding 1 to Player 2's score).
   - For `draw`, the score remains unchanged.

2. **`determine_winner/3`**:
   - Uses `play/3` to generate the results of each round.
   - Computes the total score using `compute_score/2`.
   - Determines the winner based on the score:
     - If `Score > 0`, Player 1 wins.
     - If `Score < 0`, Player 2 wins.
     - Otherwise, it's a draw.

3. **Example Query**:
   - The query `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)` will compute the winner for the given moves.
