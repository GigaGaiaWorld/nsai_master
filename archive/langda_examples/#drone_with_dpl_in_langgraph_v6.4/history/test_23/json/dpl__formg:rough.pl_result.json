  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm, splitting the list into halves, recursively sorting them, and then merging the sorted halves. The generated code uses a different approach for splitting the list, which is more concise and efficient. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the requirements."
