  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it contains a syntax error in the 'determine_winner' predicate where an arrow '->' is incorrectly used instead of a semicolon ';'. This causes the code to fail during execution. The original code correctly uses semicolons to separate conditions. Additionally, the generated code changes the output labels from 'player1', 'player2', and 'draw' to 'Player 1', 'Player 2', and 'Draw', which is a minor inconsistency but not functionally incorrect."
