  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a critical error in the 'compute_score' predicate for the 'draw' case. The generated code incorrectly uses 'compute_score(Rs, S)' instead of 'compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1', which would lead to incorrect score calculation for draw results. Despite this error, the running results are consistent with the original code for the given query, but this does not guarantee correctness for all cases."
