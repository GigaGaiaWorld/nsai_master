  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has some modifications in the rules for 'carrying' and 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))'. The generated code simplifies the 'carrying' rules by removing some conditions, which affects the probability calculation. The running results show differences in the probability for 'carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))' (0.5898 vs 0.4331), indicating the modifications impact the outcome. The rest of the results remain consistent."
