  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a multi-digit addition capability. While the original code only handles single-digit addition, the generated code correctly implements number construction from digit sequences and performs addition on these numbers. The code is syntactically correct and produces the expected result (79 + 312 = 391). However, it's not directly comparable to the original code since it solves a more complex problem. The generated code maintains consistency with the original's digit/2 facts but introduces new predicates for number processing."
