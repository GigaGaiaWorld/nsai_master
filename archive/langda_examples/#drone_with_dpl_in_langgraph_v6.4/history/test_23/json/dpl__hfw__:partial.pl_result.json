  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and structure. It correctly implements the number and operator detection, as well as the parsing logic for mathematical expressions. The only minor issue is the formatting inconsistency in the 'detect_all' predicate, where the line breaks and indentation are not perfectly aligned, but this does not affect the code's functionality. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the correct output for the given query."
