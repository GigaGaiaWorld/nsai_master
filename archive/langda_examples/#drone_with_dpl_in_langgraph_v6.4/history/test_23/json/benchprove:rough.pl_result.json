  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the functionality of the original code but introduces several issues. First, it incorrectly defines 'implies/2', 'opposite/1', and 'expand/2' as standalone predicates rather than integrating them into the 'prove/1' framework as in the original. This structural change leads to a mismatch in how these predicates are evaluated. Additionally, the generated code fails to execute properly, resulting in a timeout error, indicating either an infinite loop or incorrect predicate handling. The original code successfully executes all queries, while the generated code does not produce any valid results."
