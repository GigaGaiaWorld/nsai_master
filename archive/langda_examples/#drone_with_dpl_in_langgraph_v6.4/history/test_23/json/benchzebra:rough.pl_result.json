  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It successfully replicates the logic of the original zebra puzzle solution. The only differences are in the organization of helper predicates (my_member, next_to, right_of), which are rearranged but functionally equivalent. The generated code maintains all constraints and produces the same correct solution as the original."
