  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define the same digit facts and the addition predicate, which correctly sums the digits associated with the images. The only difference is the variable names used in the addition predicate (X2 and Y2 in the original code vs. A and B in the generated code), which does not affect the logic or outcome. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same output for the query addition(img_5,img_6,Z)."
