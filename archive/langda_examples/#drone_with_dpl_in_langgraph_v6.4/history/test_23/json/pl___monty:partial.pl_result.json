  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It accurately models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for prize placement and door selection. The generated code improves clarity by explicitly stating the conditions for opening a door and switching doors, making it easier to understand. Both codes produce identical results, confirming their equivalence."
