However, there is a syntax error in the generated code, specifically in the 'overrun_exception' predicate where there are newline characters and escape sequences that are not valid in Problog syntax. This causes a parsing error when the code is executed. The original code runs successfully and produces expected results, while the generated code fails due to this syntax issue."
