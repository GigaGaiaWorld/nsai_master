  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has a critical difference in the 'bb' predicate. The original code uses 'II is I+1, pick(II,b)' while the generated code uses 'pick(I+1, b)'. This change affects the logic and leads to a different probability result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is syntactically valid but produces an incorrect result due to this logical inconsistency."
