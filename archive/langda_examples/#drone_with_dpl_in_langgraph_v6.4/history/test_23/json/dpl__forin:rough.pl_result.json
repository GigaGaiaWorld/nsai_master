  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement insertion sort in Problog and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The generated code uses slightly different predicate names ('insert' instead of 'insert_element') but maintains the same logic and structure. The duplicate query at the end of the generated code is redundant but does not affect functionality."
