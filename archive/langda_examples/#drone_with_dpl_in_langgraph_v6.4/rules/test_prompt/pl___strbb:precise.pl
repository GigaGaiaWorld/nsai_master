% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
      palindrome(1,N).

% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
      pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A < B,
      pick(A,X),
      pick(B,X),
      AA is A+1,
      BB is B-1,

bb(N) :-
      langda(LLM:"The function of the predicate bb(N) is: for a string of length N, it checks whether there is a pair of adjacent positions in which the character b is generated.
      First calculate the maximum starting position Max = N-1;
      Enumerate each position I between 1 and Max;
      For each I, it requires that b is generated at position I (pick(I,b)), and b is also generated at the next position I+1 (pick(I+1,b));
      If any such pair of adjacent positions is found, then bb(N) is true.").
