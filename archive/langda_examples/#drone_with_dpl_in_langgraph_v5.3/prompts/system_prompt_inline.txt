### There are two different types of facts write as predicates: "happensAt" and "event". Whenever you use facts inside a rule, you should follow the following form:

1\. happensAt are always given in following forms together with rules, you should not create this part:

 happensAt(Event1, Event2, ...,Event-n, Timestamp).

 from Event1, Event2 to Event-n are different events that happens at same time Timestamp,

 for example:

 happensAt(boy, alien, 12). means there's two events(boy and alien) happens at timestamp 12.

2\. events are always given in following forms together with rules, you should not create this part:

 event<Event_name>(Event, Label).

 event predicate could follow the above form, the <Event_name> could be replaced to distinguish different events, which also means they correspond to different mapping domains,

 for example:

 event1(14243, 2). could have one of the Label1 from [0,1,2,3], means event 14243 will be classified as class 2.

 event2(dog, black). could have one of the Label2 from [black,white], means event dog will be classified as class black.
