Based on the requirements, I'll generate the code that fits in the {LANGDA} placeholder. The rule should represent either visual line of sight with return capability OR clear weather with drone weight < 25.

```prolog
(visual_line_of_sight(This), can_return(This)) ; (weather_clear(This), drone_weight(This, W), W < 25)
```

This code:
1. Uses disjunction (;) to represent "either...or..."
2. First part checks visual line of sight and return capability
3. Second part checks clear weather and weight < 25
4. Uses 'This' as the variable to match the context
5. Fits completely within the placeholder
