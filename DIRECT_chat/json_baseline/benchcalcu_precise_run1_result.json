  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) using Prolog, but it contains several issues. The main predicate 'query_sum' incorrectly uses a placeholder 'langda(LLM:...)' which is not valid Prolog syntax. The code structure suggests it should define constraints for the puzzle, but it fails to properly implement the logic. The original code shows correct solutions to the puzzle, while the generated code does not produce any valid results and incorrectly predicts 'no_solution'. The generated code is not consistent with the original code and contains syntax errors."
