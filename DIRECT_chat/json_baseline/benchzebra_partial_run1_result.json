  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve the zebra puzzle using Prolog with some constraints implemented correctly, such as 'right_of' and 'next_to' predicates. However, it mixes Prolog with 'langda(LLM:...)' calls, which are not standard Prolog and likely represent an attempt to integrate external language model assistance. This makes the code non-standard and potentially non-executable in a standard Prolog environment. The original code provides a clear solution to the zebra puzzle with specific house assignments, while the generated code's predicted results do not match the original solution, particularly in the assignment of nationalities and animals."
