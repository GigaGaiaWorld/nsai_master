  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve the zebra puzzle using Prolog with some custom predicates and rules. However, it does not produce the same structured output as the original code. The original code provides a complete solution with specific house attributes, while the generated code only outlines the rules and structure without solving the puzzle completely. The generated code is syntactically valid but lacks the detailed inference mechanism present in the original code."
