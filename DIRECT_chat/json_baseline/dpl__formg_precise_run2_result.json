  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and follows the structure of a merge sort algorithm. It includes the necessary predicates for splitting the list, merging sorted sublists, and base cases for empty and single-element lists. However, the generated code contains placeholder comments (langda(LLM:...)) that should be replaced with actual Prolog code for splitting and recursive sorting. Despite this, the actual implemented parts (split_list, merge, append) are correctly written. The running result matches the original code's output, producing the correct sorted list [1,2,3,5,7,12] for the input [3,1,2,5,7,12]."
