  "final_report": "The generated code does not fully implement the merge_sort/2 algorithm as required. While it includes a basic append/3 predicate and a query for merge_sort, it lacks the actual implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The original code shows a correct result for merge_sort, but the generated code only provides a query without the necessary logic to perform the sorting. The predicted result in the generated code matches the original result, but this is likely just a placeholder or prediction rather than an actual computation."
