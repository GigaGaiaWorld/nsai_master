  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve the zebra puzzle using Prolog with some constraints and predicates. However, it introduces 'langda(LLM:...)' which is not standard Prolog or Problog syntax, making the code invalid. The original code provides a clear solution with specific house attributes, while the generated code lacks proper implementation and produces incomplete results. The generated code's results are inconsistent with the original, as it only lists partial house information without solving the puzzle completely."
