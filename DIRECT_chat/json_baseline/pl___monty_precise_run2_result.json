  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem, with probabilities for prize distribution and door selection matching the original code. The logic for determining win probabilities when keeping or switching doors is also accurately represented. However, the generated code includes additional explanatory comments and uses a different syntax for probability definitions, which does not affect functionality but differs in form. The results are consistent with the original, showing correct probabilities for prize distribution, door selection, and win strategies."
