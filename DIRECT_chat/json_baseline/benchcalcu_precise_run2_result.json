  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) using Prolog, which is different from the original code that simply lists query results. The generated code includes necessary predicates like digit/1, leftdigit/1, all_different/1, and sumdigit/5, but it incorrectly uses a placeholder 'langda(LLM:...)' instead of proper Prolog rules to define the puzzle constraints. This makes the generated code invalid as it stands. The original code's results are specific query outputs, while the generated code's result is marked as 'unsolvable', indicating inconsistency in results."
