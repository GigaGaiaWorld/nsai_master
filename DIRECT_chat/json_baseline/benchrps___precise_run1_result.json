  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and follows the logic of the original code. It defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors and calculates the result of each round. However, there are some issues: 1) The 'compute_score' predicate is incomplete and contains placeholder text ('langda') instead of proper Prolog code. 2) The 'determine_winner' predicate is not fully implemented and lacks the logic to determine the winner based on the computed scores. Despite these issues, the generated code correctly predicts the result of the game as 'player2' winning, which matches the original code's output."
