  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and follows the structure of a merge sort algorithm. However, it contains placeholder comments (langda(LLM:...)) which are not valid Prolog syntax and would prevent the code from running as-is. The actual implementation of merge_sort/2 is missing, though the helper predicates (split_list/3, merge/3, append/3) are correctly defined. The original code shows a successful merge sort result, while the generated code, if corrected by removing the placeholder comments and implementing merge_sort/2 properly, would likely produce the same result."
