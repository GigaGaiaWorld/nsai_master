  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and follows the structure of the original code, but it lacks the actual implementation of the parse/2 predicate for handling arithmetic operations. The original code successfully computes the expression '2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7' resulting in -10.3333, while the generated code predicts -13.6667, which is incorrect. The generated code also includes unnecessary parts like the langda/1 predicate which doesn't contribute to the functionality."
