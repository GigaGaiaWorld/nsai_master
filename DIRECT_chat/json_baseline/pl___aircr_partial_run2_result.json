  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of both structure and results. The original code provides specific probabilities for goal_reached and overrun_exception at different time steps, while the generated code introduces a different model with actuator strength, wind effects, and other elements not present in the original. The generated code's results (e.g., goal_reached probabilities increasing over time) contradict the original's decreasing trend. The generated code also includes placeholder text (langda(LLM:...)) which is not valid Problog syntax."
