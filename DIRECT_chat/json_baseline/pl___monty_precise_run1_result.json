  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem, maintaining consistency with the original code in terms of logic and expected outcomes. Both codes produce the same probabilities for prize distribution, door selection, and winning strategies (keep vs. switch). The generated code includes additional explanatory comments and uses a slightly different syntax for probability definitions, but these do not affect the core functionality or results. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
