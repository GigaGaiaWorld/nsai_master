  "final_report": "The generated code is valid in form and meets the requirements, as it correctly implements the probabilistic logic for the robot and key scenario. However, the running results are not entirely consistent with the original code. Specifically, the probability of carrying the key at time s(s(s(0))) differs (0.4331 vs. 0.378), and the probabilities for the robot's location at loc2 are similar but not identical (0.9000 vs. 0.567). The generated code introduces additional predicates and rules, which may account for these discrepancies."
