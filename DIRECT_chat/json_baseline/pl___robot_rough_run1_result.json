  "final_report": "The generated code introduces additional probabilistic rules and actions not present in the original code, such as handling slippery keys and different types of actions (pickup, goto). While the generated code is more complex and detailed, it does not directly replicate the original code's simplicity or results. The original code's results show specific probabilities for the robot and key positions, which are not matched in the generated code's predicted results. The generated code's validity in form is true as it is syntactically correct and logically structured, but its results do not align with the original, making Validity_result false."
