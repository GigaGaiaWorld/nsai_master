  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem but has several issues. It lacks a proper definition of the `open_door/1` predicate, which is crucial for the problem's logic. The placeholder text 'langda(LLM:...)' is not valid Problog syntax and should be replaced with actual clauses. The predicted results section contains a commented-out definition of `open_door/1` that should be properly integrated. The original code produces clear probabilities for each outcome, while the generated code's results are not shown, making it impossible to verify consistency."
