  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem, maintaining the same probabilities for prize distribution and door selection as the original code. It includes additional explanatory comments and uses a slightly different syntax for defining probabilities, but the logic remains consistent. The results match the original output, with win_keep at 0.333 and win_switch at 0.667. The code is valid and meets the requirements."
