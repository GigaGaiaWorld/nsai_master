  "final_report": "The generated code is a valid Prolog implementation of the zebra puzzle, correctly structuring the problem with houses and rules. It uses helper predicates like right_of, next_to, and my_member effectively. However, it introduces an LLM (langda) call which is unconventional and not part of standard Prolog or ProbLog. The original code uses ProbLog and directly outputs the solution, while the generated code uses a more traditional Prolog approach with a query. The results are logically consistent but formatted differently: the original uses a probabilistic output (1.0000), while the generated code provides a deterministic solution. Both correctly identify the Japanese as owning the zebra and the Norwegian drinking water."
