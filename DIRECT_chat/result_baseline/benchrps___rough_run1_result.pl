/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors and includes a mechanism to compute the score and determine the winner. However, it lacks the 'play' predicate which is essential for comparing individual moves and generating results (win, lose, draw). This missing component makes the code incomplete and invalid for execution. The original code's result shows a clear output, while the generated code cannot produce any result due to its incompleteness.
