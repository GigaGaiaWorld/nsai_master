/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the behavior of the original code by modeling a coin-flipping scenario with a success probability of 0.8. However, the generated code contains an undefined predicate 'langda' and an unclear use of 'LLM' which makes it syntactically invalid in Problog. Despite this, the predicted results in the generated code match the original results exactly, indicating the intended logic is correct but improperly implemented.
