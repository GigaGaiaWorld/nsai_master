/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to model a coin-tossing scenario similar to the original code but uses a different approach with `make_coin` and `coins_r` predicates. The generated code includes a placeholder (`langda`) for sampling, which is not standard Problog syntax and may cause issues. Despite this, the predicted results match the original results exactly, indicating the logic is conceptually correct. However, the generated code's form is not entirely valid due to the non-standard `langda` predicate.
