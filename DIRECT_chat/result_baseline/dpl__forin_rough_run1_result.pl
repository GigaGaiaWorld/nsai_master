/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not provide a valid Prolog implementation of the insertion_sort/2 algorithm. Instead, it includes a placeholder comment and a query without the actual sorting logic. The original code successfully demonstrates the insertion sort with a correct result. The generated code fails to meet the requirements as it lacks the necessary procedural implementation.
