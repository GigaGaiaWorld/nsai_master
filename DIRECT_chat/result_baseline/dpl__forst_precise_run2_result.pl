/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly implements the stack operations as specified in the original code, including push, pop, dup, swap, over, and rot. The generated code also includes additional functionality (sort) and helper predicates (get_top_n) which were not present in the original code, but these do not interfere with the core functionality. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same outputs for the same queries. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements.
