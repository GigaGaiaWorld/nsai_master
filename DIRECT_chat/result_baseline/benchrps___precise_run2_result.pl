/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is mostly correct and follows the logic of rock-paper-scissors. It defines the basic rules and calculates the result of each round. However, there are some issues: 1) The `compute_score` predicate for 'lose' is not properly implemented (it's described in comments but not coded). 2) The `determine_winner` predicate is incomplete and doesn't actually compute the winner based on scores. 3) The output format doesn't match the original's probabilistic style (1.0000). The results are conceptually consistent (both show player2 winning) but formatted differently.
