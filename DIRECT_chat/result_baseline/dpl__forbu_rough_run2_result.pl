/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to implement a bubblesort algorithm but is incomplete and incorrect. It lacks the actual implementation of the bubblesort/3 predicate, which is crucial for the sorting functionality. The original code shows a correct sorting result, while the generated code only provides a query without a proper implementation. The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and completeness.
