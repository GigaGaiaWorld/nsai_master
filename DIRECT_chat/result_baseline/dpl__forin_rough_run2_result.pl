/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not provide a valid Problog implementation of the insertion_sort/2 algorithm. Instead, it includes a placeholder comment and a query without the actual logic. The original code successfully performs the sorting operation, while the generated code fails to deliver the required functionality. The results shown in the generated code are predictions rather than actual execution results, which do not match the original code's output format or reliability.
