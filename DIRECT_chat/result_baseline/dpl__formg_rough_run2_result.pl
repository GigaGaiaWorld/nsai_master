/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code does not meet expectations. While it correctly identifies the sorted result [1,2,3,5,7,12] for the input [3,1,2,5,7,12], it fails to provide the actual implementation of the merge_sort/2 algorithm. The generated code only includes an append/3 predicate and a query, but no sorting logic. The original code's result shows a complete merge_sort implementation with a probability value, which is missing in the generated code.
