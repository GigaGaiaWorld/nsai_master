/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to model a coin flipping scenario with 4 coins, each having a 0.8 probability of landing heads. The logic is implemented recursively, but the 'langda' predicate is unclear and seems to be a placeholder or misinterpretation. Despite this, the predicted results match the original output exactly, indicating the underlying probabilistic logic is correct. The form of the generated code is unconventional due to the 'langda' predicate, which may not be valid in standard Problog or DeepProbLog.
