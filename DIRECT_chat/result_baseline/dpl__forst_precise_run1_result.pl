/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) as specified in the original code. The logic for each operation is accurately translated into Problog rules. Additionally, the generated code includes a custom 'sort' operation and a helper predicate 'get_top_n', which were not present in the original code but do not interfere with the expected functionality. The query results match exactly with the original code's output, demonstrating consistency in behavior.
