/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the behavior of the original code by modeling coin tosses and calculating the probability distribution of heads. However, it introduces an unnecessary and incorrect use of 'langda' and 'LLM' which are not valid in Problog or DeepProbLog. The original code's results are correctly replicated in the predicted results section, but the implementation is flawed. The generated code is not syntactically correct due to the invalid predicates.
