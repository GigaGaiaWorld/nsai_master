% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
      palindrome(1,N).

% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
      pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A < B,
      pick(A,X),

      AA is A+1,

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not meet the expectations. The original code's result shows a probability of 0.3750 for bb(5), while the generated code predicts a probability of 0.68359375, which is inconsistent. The generated code introduces a new definition for bb(N) using a language model (LLM) and includes additional predicates like palindrome and pick, which were not present in the original code. This makes the generated code structurally different and functionally inconsistent with the original code.
