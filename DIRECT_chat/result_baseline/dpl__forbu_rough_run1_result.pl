/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm but is incomplete and contains errors. It references a 'bubblesort/3' predicate that is not defined, and the 'langda' predicate is unclear and not standard Prolog. The original code shows a correct sorting result, while the generated code does not provide a complete or executable solution. The generated code's structure does not match the original's functionality.
