/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly defines the predicates for digit recognition and implements a multi_addition predicate that converts lists of image IDs to their corresponding integer values and sums them. The code is consistent with the original code's functionality, as both aim to perform addition on numbers derived from image IDs. However, the generated code includes additional details like the digit predicates and a more explicit number conversion process, which were not present in the original code but are necessary for the functionality. The running results of both codes are consistent, both yielding a sum of 391 for the given inputs.
