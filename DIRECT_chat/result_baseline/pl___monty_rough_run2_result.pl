/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem but is incomplete and incorrect. It lacks the proper definition of `open_door/1`, which is crucial for the problem's logic. The original code provides clear probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors, while the generated code fails to produce these results due to its incompleteness. The generated code also includes an unrelated comment about DeepSeek's prediction, which is not part of the functional code.
