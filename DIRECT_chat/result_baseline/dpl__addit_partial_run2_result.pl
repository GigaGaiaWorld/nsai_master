/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not meet the expectations as it significantly deviates from the original code. The original code performs a multi-digit addition operation with a clear result, while the generated code focuses on defining digits and a vague addition logic using langda predicates. The generated code also includes unrelated LLM annotations and does not demonstrate the same functionality as the original. The result of the generated code is a simple addition of two digits, which is inconsistent with the multi-digit addition in the original code.
