  "ErrorSummary": "The parse/2 predicate is incomplete and does not handle arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as required. The current implementation only handles single-number inputs.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Add recursive rules for parse/2 to handle arithmetic operations. For example:\nparse([N1, O, N2 | T], R) :-\n  almost_equal(N1, N1f),\n  almost_equal(N2, N2f),\n  (O = '+' -> R1 is N1f + N2f;\n   O = '-' -> R1 is N1f - N2f;\n   O = '*' -> R1 is N1f * N2f;\n   O = '/' -> R1 is N1f / N2f),\n  parse([R1 | T], R).\nAlso, ensure the base case parse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R) is retained.",
