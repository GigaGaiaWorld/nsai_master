### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, ...]`). The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `detect_all/2` to map images to their corresponding symbols and then evaluates the expression. The primary requirement is to define the `parse/2` predicate to handle arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in a list format, ensuring correctness and termination.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The query returned `X = 0.0000`, which is incorrect for the given expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`. The expected result should be approximately `-10.3333`.

**Conclusion**: The test failed. The `parse/2` predicate is not correctly evaluating the arithmetic expression.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `parse/2`  
  - **Issue**: The `parse/2` predicate is only defined for single-number inputs (`parse([N], R)`) and lacks rules for handling arithmetic operations.  
  - **Code Line**: The issue lies in the missing rules for parsing and evaluating expressions with operators (e.g., `[N1, O, N2 | T]`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `parse/2` predicate does not recursively evaluate sub-expressions or apply arithmetic operations.  
  - The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly defined but unused in the context of arithmetic operations.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The current implementation lacks recursive rules for parsing and evaluating expressions, leading to incomplete functionality.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/...`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code correctly maps images to symbols but fails to evaluate expressions.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined symbols are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not addressed due to the lack of recursive parsing rules.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `parse/2` incomplete             | Incorrect expression evaluation | Define recursive rules for `parse/2` to handle arithmetic operations.      |
| 2      | Missing edge case handling       | Potential runtime errors       | Add checks for invalid inputs (e.g., non-list or undefined symbols).       |
| 3      | DeepProbLog not used             | Limited functionality          | Consider integrating neural network predicates if probabilistic reasoning is required. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code requires significant revisions to meet the functional requirements, particularly in the `parse/2` predicate. Addressing the missing arithmetic rules and edge cases will ensure correctness and robustness. The absence of probabilistic or DeepProbLog features limits the scope of the current implementation.
