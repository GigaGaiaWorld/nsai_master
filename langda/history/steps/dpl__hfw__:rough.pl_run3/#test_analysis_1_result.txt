### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, ...]`) into their evaluated results. The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `parse/2` to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze potential failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The query returned `X = 0.0000`, which is incorrect for the given expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`. The expected result should be approximately `-10.3333`.

**Conclusion**: The test failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returned `0.0000` instead of the expected `-10.3333`.
  
- **Error Location**:  
  The issue lies in the `parse/2` predicate, specifically in the handling of arithmetic operations. The current implementation does not correctly account for operator precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).

- **Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  parse([N1, +, N2 | T], R) :- almost_equal(N1 + N2, Temp), parse([Temp | T], R).
  ```
  This rule does not handle operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `parse/2` predicate processes operations left-to-right without considering precedence, which is incorrect for arithmetic expressions. For example, `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7` should be evaluated as `(2 / 3) + 3 - (2 * 7)`.

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `parse/2` terminates correctly, but the evaluation logic is flawed.

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated. However, the deterministic evaluation is incorrect.

- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code parses expressions but fails to evaluate them correctly due to incorrect operator precedence handling.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs or invalid operators are not handled.
  - **Deep Recursion**: No performance issues observed, but the logic is flawed.
  - **Operator Precedence**: Not implemented, leading to incorrect results.

|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong evaluation of expressions | Implement operator precedence in `parse/2`. |
| 2      | No handling of invalid inputs    | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.                       |
| 3      | No probabilistic features used   | Limited functionality           | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed.  |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires revision to handle operator precedence and edge cases. The current implementation is incorrect for arithmetic expressions involving multiple operations.
