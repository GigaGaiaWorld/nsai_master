<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze any failures in the test results.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```

**Interpretation:** The error indicates that the ProbLog engine could not find a clause for the `->/2` operator, which is used in the `determine_winner` predicate. This suggests a syntax or logical error in the implementation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location:** Line 41, column 77 (in the `determine_winner` predicate).
- **Problematic Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
      compute_score(Results, Score),
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
- **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is not correctly interpreted in the ProbLog context. ProbLog does not support the Prolog-style `->/2` operator for conditional branching.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Context:**
  - The `determine_winner` predicate uses Prolog-style conditional branching (`->/2`), which is not valid in ProbLog. ProbLog requires probabilistic or logical constructs without imperative control flow.
  - The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are logically correct but are not utilized properly due to the `determine_winner` error.

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Context:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core logic for determining round results (`result/3`) and computing scores (`compute_score/2`) is correct, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails due to syntax issues.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** Not handled. The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Invalid use of `->/2` in `determine_winner` | Predicate fails to execute | Replace with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3` or separate clauses). |
| 2   | No handling of invalid inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for moves and list structures. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix `determine_winner`:**
   Replace the Prolog-style conditional with ProbLog-compatible logic. For example:
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
       compute_score(Results, Score),
       (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1';
        Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2';
        Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
   ```

2. **Add Input Validation:**
   Ensure inputs are valid moves and lists:
   ```prolog
   valid_move(M) :- member(M, [rock, paper, scissor]).
   valid_moves([]).
   valid_moves([H|T]) :- valid_move(H), valid_moves(T).
   ```

3. **Test Cases:**
   Include additional test cases for edge cases (e.g., empty lists, invalid moves).

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation has logical correctness in the core rules but fails due to syntax incompatibility in the `determine_winner` predicate. Fixing this and adding input validation will resolve the issues.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
