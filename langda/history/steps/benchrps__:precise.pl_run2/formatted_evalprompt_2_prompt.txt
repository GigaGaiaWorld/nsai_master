<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, where two players' moves are compared to determine the winner. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, including classical reasoning, recursive termination, and adherence to the game's rules. The evaluation also ensures that the code meets the functional requirements and handles edge cases appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies 'Player 2' as the winner, with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**:  
  The test case aligns with the expected behavior. The predicates `play/3`, `result/3`, and `compute_score/2` function correctly, and the recursive termination is handled properly.  
  - **Code Line Verification**:  
    - `play/3` (lines 15–20): Correctly processes lists of moves and computes results.  
    - `result/3` (lines 8–13): Accurately determines win, lose, or draw based on the game rules.  
    - `compute_score/2` (lines 22–25): Correctly calculates the final score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The logical correctness is ensured by the explicit definition of `beats/2` and the recursive termination in `play/3`.  
  - The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly for empty lists.  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Undefined behavior for invalid inputs.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Handled gracefully due to proper termination conditions.  
  - **Empty Lists**: Correctly processed, returning an empty result list and a score of 0.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem               | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|-----------------------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic facts | None   | Add probabilistic rules if needed. |
| 2      | No input validation   | Low    | Validate inputs to handle invalid moves. |
| 3      | DeepProbLog not used  | None   | Consider neural integration for advanced features. |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The implementation is logically correct and meets the specified requirements. No failures were detected in the provided test case. Edge cases and potential improvements are noted for future enhancements.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
