### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, where two players' moves are compared to determine the winner. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, including classical reasoning, recursive termination, and adherence to the game's rules. The evaluation also ensures that the code meets the functional requirements and handles edge cases appropriately.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies 'Player 2' as the winner, with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**:  
  The test case aligns with the expected behavior. The predicates `play/3`, `result/3`, and `compute_score/2` function correctly, and the recursive termination is handled properly.  
  - **Code Line Verification**:  
    - `play/3` (lines 15–20): Correctly processes lists of moves and computes results.  
    - `result/3` (lines 8–13): Accurately determines win, lose, or draw based on the game rules.  
    - `compute_score/2` (lines 22–25): Correctly calculates the final score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The logical correctness is ensured by the explicit definition of `beats/2` and the recursive termination in `play/3`.  
  - The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly for empty lists.  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Undefined behavior for invalid inputs.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Handled gracefully due to proper termination conditions.  
  - **Empty Lists**: Correctly processed, returning an empty result list and a score of 0.

| Number | Problem               | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|-----------------------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic facts | None   | Add probabilistic rules if needed. |
| 2      | No input validation   | Low    | Validate inputs to handle invalid moves. |
| 3      | DeepProbLog not used  | None   | Consider neural integration for advanced features. |
