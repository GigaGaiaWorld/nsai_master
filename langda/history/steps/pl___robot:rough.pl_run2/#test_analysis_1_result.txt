### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate an error during evaluation:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = action(s, pos)
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 370, in _token_dot
    raise UnexpectedCharacter(s, pos)
problog.parser.UnexpectedCharacter: Unexpected character '.' at 30:82.
```  
- **Failed Queries**: None (evaluation halted due to syntax error).  
- **Passed Queries**: N/A (evaluation did not complete).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs at line 30, column 82, where an unexpected character `.` is encountered. This suggests a syntax issue in the code.  

**Affected Code Block**:  
```prolog
at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-
 \+ goto_action(T),
 at(robot,Pos,T).
at(key,Pos,T) :-
 carrying(key,T),
 at(robot,Pos,T).
at(key,Pos,s(T)) :-
 \+ carrying(key,s(T)),
 at(key,Pos,T).
```  
- **Issue**: The error likely stems from improper formatting or an extra character in the code.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog**:  
  - The recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) are logically correct but may not terminate if base cases are missing.  
  - The error prevents further analysis of termination conditions.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:  
  - Probabilistic facts (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`) comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - The negation `\+` is used correctly in probabilistic contexts.  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No `nn/3` or `tensor/…` calls are present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (error prevents full verification).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Compliant with rules, but syntax error halts execution.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are not present.  
  - Recursive performance could be an issue if base cases are missing.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error (unexpected '.')    | Halts code evaluation           | Inspect line 30 for extra characters or formatting issues. |
| 2   | Recursive termination unchecked  | Potential infinite recursion    | Ensure all recursive predicates have base cases. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code contains a syntax error that must be resolved before further evaluation. Once fixed, the recursive and probabilistic logic should be re-verified.
