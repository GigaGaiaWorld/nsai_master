### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Navigation and Key Handling**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a robot navigating between locations while handling a key. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4813 |
| `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0900 |
| `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0100 |
| `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.6300 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.3630 |
| `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0070 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilistic outcomes based on the defined rules and facts.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The predicates for `carrying/2`, `drops/2`, and `slippery/2` are logically sound and correctly handle recursion and negation-as-failure (`\+`).  
  - The `at/3` predicates for the robot and key are correctly defined to handle success and failure cases for movement (`goto_succeeds` and `goto_fails`).  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - Recursive predicates (e.g., `slippery/2`) terminate correctly due to the base case (`slippery(key,0)`).  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules:**  
  - The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds`, `drop_slippery_key`, and `fumbles_key` comply with the rule `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
  - The annotated disjunctions (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.3::pickup_fails(T)`) are correctly implemented.  

- **Negation and Implications:**  
  - Negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used correctly, and its probabilistic interpretation aligns with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement | Status | Explanation |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Classical Reasoning | Met | The code handles deterministic and non-deterministic logic correctly. |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met | Probabilities are correctly computed and applied. |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed. |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** The code does not use undefined predicates or require `expand/2`.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable and terminates correctly.
