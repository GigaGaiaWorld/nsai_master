### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The primary goal of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result (Probability) |
|-------|----------------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | 0.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | 0.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | 0.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | 0.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | 0.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | 0.0000 |

**Observation**: All queries returned a probability of `0.0000`, indicating that none of the operations were successfully executed. This suggests a failure in the implementation of the stack operations.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Queries**: All queries failed.  
- **Root Cause**: The `stack_op/3` predicate is only implemented for the `sort` operation, as shown in the code block:  
  ```prolog
  stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-
      ( length(Stack, L), L >= 3 ->
          get_top_n(Stack, 3, Elements, RestStack),
          insertion_sort(Elements, SortedElements),
          append(SortedElements, RestStack, SortedStack)
      ; SortedStack = Stack
      ).
  ```
  The other operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are not defined, leading to their failure.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The `stack_op/3` predicate lacks definitions for all required operations. Only the `sort` operation is implemented.  
  - The `get_top_n/4` predicate is defined but not utilized for other operations.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code. The failures are purely due to missing classical logic.  
  - The absence of probabilistic constructs (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is irrelevant here.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (only `sort` is implemented).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are a major oversight.  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not handled, but these are irrelevant due to the lack of implementation.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing definitions for `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot` | All operations fail | Implement the missing operations. |
| 2   | No probabilistic facts/rules | No probabilistic reasoning | Add probabilistic constructs if required. |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Use `nn/3` or similar if needed. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code fails to meet the requirements due to missing implementations of key stack operations. The evaluation highlights the need for comprehensive implementation and testing of all specified operations.
