### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including sorting the top three elements of a stack. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `0.0000` |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `0.0000` |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `0.0000` |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `0.0000` |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `0.0000` |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `0.0000` |

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (probability `0.0000` for all queries).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Queries:** All queries (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) returned `0.0000`, indicating no successful execution.
- **Root Cause:** The code only implements the `sort` operation and does not define predicates for other stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`). The `stack_op/3` predicate is incomplete.
- **Affected Code:** The entire `stack_op/3` predicate is missing implementations for the required operations.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The `sort` operation is logically correct and terminates properly. However, the lack of definitions for other operations causes all queries to fail.
  - Recursive predicates (`insertion_sort`, `insert`) are correctly implemented and terminate as expected.
- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code. The failures are purely due to missing classical logic.
- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Feature Not Used:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (only `sort` is implemented).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are not handled.
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the simplicity of the `sort` operation.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing implementations for `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot` | All queries fail | Implement the missing operations. |
| 2 | No probabilistic facts/rules | Limited functionality | Add probabilistic rules if required. |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Include `nn/3` calls if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The code fails to meet the requirements due to incomplete implementations of stack operations. Addressing the missing operations will resolve the test failures.
