<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on the correctness of the `open_door/1` predicate and the overall probabilistic reasoning. The goal is to verify compliance with the requirements and identify any errors or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code results in a `ParseError` due to an operator priority clash. No queries were successfully executed. The error occurs during parsing, preventing any further evaluation of the model.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**: The `ParseError` occurs at line 6, column 158, in the `open_door/1` predicate definition.  
- **Problematic Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  open_door(A) :-
      select_door(Selected),
      findall(X, (member(X, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), \+ (X = Selected)), Doors),
      Doors = [A, B],
      0.5::open_door(A),
      0.5::open_door(B).
  ```
- **Issue**: The syntax for probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door(A)`) is incorrectly nested within the predicate body, violating ProbLog's parsing rules.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate attempts to model Monty's behavior but misuses probabilistic annotations. Probabilistic facts must be defined at the top level, not within a rule body.  
  - The `findall/3` call correctly identifies non-prize doors, but the probabilistic assignment is syntactically invalid.  

- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The requirements specify uniform randomness (`0.5::open_door(A)`), but this must be defined as a top-level probabilistic fact, not embedded in a rule.  
  - Negation (`\+`) is used correctly to exclude prize and selected doors.  

- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logical conditions are correct, but syntax errors prevent execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to incorrect syntax for probabilistic facts.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code assumes exactly three doors (`[1,2,3]`). Non-list inputs or fewer/more doors would break the logic.  
  - Recursion in `member/2` is correct but irrelevant due to the parsing error.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | `ParseError` due to nested probabilistic facts | Prevents execution | Move probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door(A)`) to the top level. |
| 2 | Incorrect handling of probabilistic assignments | Logical inconsistency | Define probabilistic choices separately, e.g., `0.5::open_door(1); 0.5::open_door(2)`. |
| 3 | Assumption of fixed door count | Brittleness | Generalize to handle variable door counts. |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. **Fix Syntax**: Separate probabilistic facts from rules. For example:  
   ```prolog
   0.5::open_door(1); 0.5::open_door(2).  % Top-level definition
   open_door(A) :- ...  % Logical rule without probabilistic annotations
   ```
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Validate for varying door counts and invalid inputs.  
3. **Document Assumptions**: Explicitly state the fixed door count requirement.  

**Word Count**: 450  

--- 

This report highlights the critical syntax error and provides actionable fixes to align the implementation with ProbLog's requirements.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
