### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The problem demonstrates that switching doors increases the probability of winning from 1/3 to 2/3.

This report evaluates the correctness of the ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, focusing on the `open_door/1` predicate and its adherence to the problem's probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails with the error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:147.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The error indicates that the `open_door/1` predicate is not correctly defined or referenced. The test results do not provide specific query outputs due to this failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (line 6).  
- **Root Cause:** The predicate is not correctly implemented to handle the two cases specified in the requirements:  
  1. Randomly selecting between two non-prize, non-selected doors.  
  2. Opening the only remaining non-prize, non-selected door.  

The current implementation attempts to use `random_member/2`, which is not a built-in ProbLog predicate, leading to the error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate fails to comply with ProbLog's syntax and built-in predicates. ProbLog does not support `random_member/2` or imperative control constructs like `->/2` in the same way as Prolog.  
  - The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined but not used effectively in the `open_door/1` clause.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (`1/3::prize(1)`, etc.) are correctly defined.  
  - The negation `\+ prize(D)` and `\+ (D = Selected)` are syntactically correct but not properly integrated into the `open_door/1` logic.  

- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `member/2` and `select_door/1` predicates are correct, but `open_door/1` is flawed.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The probabilistic facts are correct, but the integration with the `open_door/1` logic fails.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where no valid doors are left (though this is impossible in the Monty Hall problem).  
  - The use of `random_member/2` is problematic in ProbLog, as it is not a supported built-in.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Undefined `random_member/2` | Prevents execution | Replace with ProbLog-compatible probabilistic choice (e.g., `prob::uniform/1`). |
| 2   | Incorrect `open_door/1` logic | Fails to meet requirements | Rewrite the predicate to explicitly handle the two cases without unsupported constructs. |
| 3   | Unsupported `->/2` syntax | Causes runtime error | Use ProbLog's supported control constructs (e.g., `if-then-else` via `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)`). |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation requires corrections to the `open_door/1` predicate to align with ProbLog's syntax and probabilistic rules. The error stems from unsupported Prolog constructs, which must be replaced with ProbLog-compatible alternatives. Once fixed, the model should correctly reflect the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic behavior.
