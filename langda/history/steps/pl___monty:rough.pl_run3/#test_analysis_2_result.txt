### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the `open_door/1` predicate, which simulates Monty's action of opening a door based on the player's initial choice and the prize location. The evaluation includes verifying the probabilistic reasoning, logical correctness, and adherence to the problem's requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error for the `->/2` operator at line 6:132. This suggests a syntax or logical error in the `open_door/1` predicate. No queries were successfully executed due to this error.

**Failed Queries:**  
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed to execute because of the `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 6:132 in the `open_door/1` predicate.  
  - The error occurs due to incorrect usage of the `->/2` operator in the conditional logic.  

- **Problematic Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  open_door(D) :- 
      select_door(Selected), 
      findall(X, (member(X, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), \+ (X = Selected)), Doors), 
      (   Doors = [A, B] -> 0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) ;   Doors = [A] -> open_door(A) ).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to handle two cases:  
    1. Two doors are available for Monty to open (uniformly random).  
    2. Only one door is available (Monty must open it).  
  - The current implementation incorrectly nests the `->/2` operator, leading to a syntax error.  

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The use of `0.5::open_door(A)` and `0.5::open_door(B)` is correct for uniform randomness.  
  - However, the syntax error prevents the probabilistic reasoning from being evaluated.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the `open_door/1` predicate fails due to syntax/logical errors.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not evaluated due to the error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `findall/3` call ensures valid door selection, but the conditional logic is flawed.  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined cases are not handled explicitly.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Syntax error in `->/2` operator  | Prevents all queries from executing | Rewrite the conditional logic using separate clauses or correct `->/2` usage. |
| 2      | Incorrect nesting of conditions  | Logical inconsistency          | Split the `open_door/1` predicate into two separate clauses for clarity.  |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Rewrite the `open_door/1` predicate as follows:  
```prolog
open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), \+ (X = Selected)), Doors),
    Doors = [A, B],
    Prob is 0.5,
    Prob::open_door(A),
    Prob::open_door(B).

open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), \+ (X = Selected)), Doors),
    Doors = [A].
```

This ensures clarity and correctness in handling the two cases.
