### **Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on the correctness of the `open_door/1` predicate and the overall probabilistic reasoning. The goal is to verify compliance with the requirements and identify any errors or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code results in a `ParseError` due to an operator priority clash. No queries were successfully executed. The error occurs during parsing, preventing any further evaluation of the model.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**: The `ParseError` occurs at line 6, column 158, in the `open_door/1` predicate definition.  
- **Problematic Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  open_door(A) :-
      select_door(Selected),
      findall(X, (member(X, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), \+ (X = Selected)), Doors),
      Doors = [A, B],
      0.5::open_door(A),
      0.5::open_door(B).
  ```
- **Issue**: The syntax for probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door(A)`) is incorrectly nested within the predicate body, violating ProbLog's parsing rules.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate attempts to model Monty's behavior but misuses probabilistic annotations. Probabilistic facts must be defined at the top level, not within a rule body.  
  - The `findall/3` call correctly identifies non-prize doors, but the probabilistic assignment is syntactically invalid.  

- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The requirements specify uniform randomness (`0.5::open_door(A)`), but this must be defined as a top-level probabilistic fact, not embedded in a rule.  
  - Negation (`\+`) is used correctly to exclude prize and selected doors.  

- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logical conditions are correct, but syntax errors prevent execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to incorrect syntax for probabilistic facts.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code assumes exactly three doors (`[1,2,3]`). Non-list inputs or fewer/more doors would break the logic.  
  - Recursion in `member/2` is correct but irrelevant due to the parsing error.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | `ParseError` due to nested probabilistic facts | Prevents execution | Move probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door(A)`) to the top level. |
| 2 | Incorrect handling of probabilistic assignments | Logical inconsistency | Define probabilistic choices separately, e.g., `0.5::open_door(1); 0.5::open_door(2)`. |
| 3 | Assumption of fixed door count | Brittleness | Generalize to handle variable door counts. |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. **Fix Syntax**: Separate probabilistic facts from rules. For example:  
   ```prolog
   0.5::open_door(1); 0.5::open_door(2).  % Top-level definition
   open_door(A) :- ...  % Logical rule without probabilistic annotations
   ```
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Validate for varying door counts and invalid inputs.  
3. **Document Assumptions**: Explicitly state the fixed door count requirement.  

**Word Count**: 450
