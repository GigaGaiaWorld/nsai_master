### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,3,1,4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected behavior for each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates and rules function as intended. The following predicates were verified:
- `stack_op/3` (lines 1–7)
- `get_top_n/4` (lines 8–9)
- `insertion_sort/2` and auxiliary predicates (lines 10–18)

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `stack_op(pop, [Top|Rest], Rest)` correctly removes the top element.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate ensures termination by reducing the list size in each recursive call.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All stack operations behave as expected.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate may face performance issues with large lists due to its quadratic complexity.
- **Undefined Cases:** The `sort` operation assumes at least 3 elements in the stack. Fewer elements may lead to unexpected behavior.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input for stack | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | `sort` with fewer than 3 elements | Undefined behavior | Handle cases with fewer elements. |
| 3 | Recursive performance for large lists | Slow execution | Optimize sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort). |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The code is functionally correct for the tested cases. However, edge cases and performance optimizations should be addressed for robustness. No DeepProbLog features are used.
