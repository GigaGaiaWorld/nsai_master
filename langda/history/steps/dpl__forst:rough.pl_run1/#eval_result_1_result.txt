  "HASH": "5E40E418",
  "ErrorSummary": "1. Non-list input for stack causes runtime errors. 2. 'sort' operation undefined for stacks with fewer than 3 elements. 3. Recursive performance issues with large lists due to insertion sort.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for stack operations (e.g., check list type). 2. Modify 'sort' to handle stacks with <3 elements (e.g., return as-is for 0-1 elements, single swap for 2). 3. Replace insertion_sort with a more efficient algorithm (e.g., quicksort) for lines 10-18.",
