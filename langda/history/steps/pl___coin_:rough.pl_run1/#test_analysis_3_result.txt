### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Model**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Model with Recursive Sampling**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a coin toss scenario where a biased coin (`make_coin/2`) is tossed `CNT` times, and the total number of heads (`S`) is accumulated recursively. The goal is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, recursive termination, and adherence to ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the query `total(_)` are as follows:  
- `total(4) = 0.8000`  
- `total(0) = 0.2000`  

**Verification:**  
- The results align with the expected probabilities for a biased coin (0.8 probability of heads).  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

**Explanation:**  
- The probability of all 4 tosses being heads (`total(4)`) is `0.8^4 = 0.4096`, but the provided result (`0.8000`) suggests a misinterpretation. The correct probability for `total(4)` should be `0.4096`.  
- The probability of all tosses being tails (`total(0)`) is `0.2^4 = 0.0016`, but the result (`0.2000`) is incorrect.  

**Conclusion:**  
The test results are **incorrect** due to a misunderstanding of the cumulative probability calculation.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Queries:**  
1. **`total(4)`**  
   - **Expected:** `0.4096` (for 4 heads).  
   - **Actual:** `0.8000`.  
   - **Error Location:** The recursive rule `coins_r/3` does not correctly accumulate independent probabilities.  

2. **`total(0)`**  
   - **Expected:** `0.0016` (for 0 heads).  
   - **Actual:** `0.2000`.  
   - **Error Location:** The negation `\+ make_coin(c1,0.8)` is not correctly weighted with `0.2`.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Issues:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive rule `coins_r/3` correctly terminates when `CNT = 0` but fails to compute cumulative probabilities.  
  - The disjunction `(make_coin(c1,0.8), NewSC is SC + 1 ; \+ make_coin(c1,0.8), NewSC = SC)` does not account for the independence of events.  

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
- **Negation:** `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is not applied correctly. The probability of `\+ make_coin(c1,0.8)` should be `0.2`, but the rule treats it as a deterministic failure.  
- **Implication:** The disjunction `;` should compute the joint probability of independent events, but it does not.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Not Used:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive termination works, but probability accumulation is flawed).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (incorrect handling of independent events and negation).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for small `CNT` (e.g., 4), but scalability is untested.

| 2   | Negation not weighted            | Underestimates tails probability | Explicitly use `0.2` for `\+ make_coin(c1,0.8)`.                          |
