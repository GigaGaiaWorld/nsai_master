### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`S`). The code uses recursion to sample coins and count heads. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a **non-ground probabilistic clause**. The error occurs at line 1, column 5, where the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not properly grounded.  

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Error:** `NonGroundProbabilisticClause`  
  - **Impact:** The query cannot be evaluated because the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not grounded.  

**Expected Behavior:**  
The query should return a probability distribution over possible values of `S` (total heads after tossing `CNT` coins).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `coin(C)`  
  - **Code Location:** Line 1  
  - **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not grounded, violating ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground (i.e., `C` must be instantiated).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for counting heads, but the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not grounded, preventing execution.  
  - Recursive termination is correctly implemented with the base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)`.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The code does not comply with ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground.  
  - The negation/implication rules are not applicable here, as the issue is syntactic.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but grounding issue prevents execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to non-ground probabilistic fact.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-ground Probabilistic Facts:** The primary issue.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** Not tested due to grounding failure.  
  - **Input Validation:** Not applicable (no user input).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic fact    | Query evaluation fails         | Ground the probabilistic fact (e.g., `coin(c1)`) or use a list of coins. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic fact, which is a fundamental requirement in ProbLog. To fix this, ensure all probabilistic facts are grounded. The recursive logic is otherwise correct. No DeepProbLog features are used.
