### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Model**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Simulating Coin Tosses**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a coin `CNT` times and accumulate the number of heads (`S`). The model uses probabilistic facts (`make_coin/2`) and recursive rules (`coins_r/3`) to achieve this. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's syntax and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:24.
  ```
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to an unsupported control construct (`->/2`) in ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Line 8:** `(make_coin(c1,0.8) -> (NewSC is SC + 1) ; NewSC = SC)`  
  - **Issue:** The `->/2` (if-then) construct is not supported in ProbLog.  
- **Expected Behavior:**  
  ProbLog does not support imperative control constructs like `->/2`. Instead, logical disjunction (`;`) and conjunction (`,`) should be used for conditional logic.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive rule `coins_r/3` is logically sound but uses an unsupported construct (`->/2`).  
  - The termination condition (`CNT > 0`) is correct, but the recursive step fails due to the syntax error.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The probabilistic fact `0.8::make_coin(c1,0.8)` is correctly defined.  
  - The negation/implication rules (`P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`) are not violated, but the unsupported `->/2` prevents execution.  
- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Feature Not Used:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but syntax is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (probabilistic facts are correctly defined).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Constructs:** The `->/2` operator is unsupported.  
  - **Recursive Performance:** No issues identified (termination is correctly handled).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator | Code fails to execute           | Replace `->/2` with logical disjunction: `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)`. |
| 2   | Incomplete code block       | Missing closing parenthesis     | Ensure all parentheses and brackets are properly closed.                   |

---

### **Revised Code Suggestion**  
Replace the problematic line with ProbLog-compatible logic:
```problog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (make_coin(c1,0.8), NewSC is SC + 1 ; \+ make_coin(c1,0.8), NewSC = SC),
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT).
```
