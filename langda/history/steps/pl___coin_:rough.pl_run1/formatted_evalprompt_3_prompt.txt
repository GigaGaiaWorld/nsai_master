</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Model**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Model with Recursive Sampling**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a coin toss scenario where a biased coin (`make_coin/2`) is tossed `CNT` times, and the total number of heads (`S`) is accumulated recursively. The goal is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, recursive termination, and adherence to ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the query `total(_)` are as follows:  
- `total(4) = 0.8000`  
- `total(0) = 0.2000`  

**Verification:**  
- The results align with the expected probabilities for a biased coin (0.8 probability of heads).  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

**Explanation:**  
- The probability of all 4 tosses being heads (`total(4)`) is `0.8^4 = 0.4096`, but the provided result (`0.8000`) suggests a misinterpretation. The correct probability for `total(4)` should be `0.4096`.  
- The probability of all tosses being tails (`total(0)`) is `0.2^4 = 0.0016`, but the result (`0.2000`) is incorrect.  

**Conclusion:**  
The test results are **incorrect** due to a misunderstanding of the cumulative probability calculation.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Queries:**  
1. **`total(4)`**  
   - **Expected:** `0.4096` (for 4 heads).  
   - **Actual:** `0.8000`.  
   - **Error Location:** The recursive rule `coins_r/3` does not correctly accumulate independent probabilities.  

2. **`total(0)`**  
   - **Expected:** `0.0016` (for 0 heads).  
   - **Actual:** `0.2000`.  
   - **Error Location:** The negation `\+ make_coin(c1,0.8)` is not correctly weighted with `0.2`.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Issues:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive rule `coins_r/3` correctly terminates when `CNT = 0` but fails to compute cumulative probabilities.  
  - The disjunction `(make_coin(c1,0.8), NewSC is SC + 1 ; \+ make_coin(c1,0.8), NewSC = SC)` does not account for the independence of events.  

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
- **Negation:** `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is not applied correctly. The probability of `\+ make_coin(c1,0.8)` should be `0.2`, but the rule treats it as a deterministic failure.  
- **Implication:** The disjunction `;` should compute the joint probability of independent events, but it does not.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Not Used:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive termination works, but probability accumulation is flawed).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (incorrect handling of independent events and negation).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for small `CNT` (e.g., 4), but scalability is untested.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect probability accumulation | Results in wrong probabilities  | Rewrite `coins_r/3` to multiply probabilities of independent events.      |
| 2   | Negation not weighted            | Underestimates tails probability | Explicitly use `0.2` for `\+ make_coin(c1,0.8)`.                          |
| 3   | Disjunction misuse               | Misrepresents independence      | Replace `;` with probabilistic conjunction (`P * Q`) for independent events. |

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
