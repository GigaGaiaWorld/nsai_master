    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:24.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Model**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Simulating Coin Tosses**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a coin `CNT` times and accumulate the number of heads (`S`). The model uses probabilistic facts (`make_coin/2`) and recursive rules (`coins_r/3`) to achieve this. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's syntax and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:24.
  ```
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to an unsupported control construct (`->/2`) in ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Line 8:** `(make_coin(c1,0.8) -> (NewSC is SC + 1) ; NewSC = SC)`  
  - **Issue:** The `->/2` (if-then) construct is not supported in ProbLog.  
- **Expected Behavior:**  
  ProbLog does not support imperative control constructs like `->/2`. Instead, logical disjunction (`;`) and conjunction (`,`) should be used for conditional logic.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive rule `coins_r/3` is logically sound but uses an unsupported construct (`->/2`).  
  - The termination condition (`CNT > 0`) is correct, but the recursive step fails due to the syntax error.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The probabilistic fact `0.8::make_coin(c1,0.8)` is correctly defined.  
  - The negation/implication rules (`P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`) are not violated, but the unsupported `->/2` prevents execution.  
- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Feature Not Used:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but syntax is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (probabilistic facts are correctly defined).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Constructs:** The `->/2` operator is unsupported.  
  - **Recursive Performance:** No issues identified (termination is correctly handled).  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator | Code fails to execute           | Replace `->/2` with logical disjunction: `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)`. |
| 2   | Incomplete code block       | Missing closing parenthesis     | Ensure all parentheses and brackets are properly closed.                   |

---

### **Revised Code Suggestion**  
Replace the problematic line with ProbLog-compatible logic:
```problog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (make_coin(c1,0.8), NewSC is SC + 1 ; \+ make_coin(c1,0.8), NewSC = SC),
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT).
```

**Word Count:** 450  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Logic:** Clear and structured.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
