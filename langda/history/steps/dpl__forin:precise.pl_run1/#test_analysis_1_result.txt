### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, recursive termination, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```problog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are correctly defined and satisfy the requirements:  
1. Recursively sorting the tail list.  
2. Inserting the head element into the sorted list.  

**Code Verification:**  
- **`insertion_sort/2`:** Correctly implements recursion (lines 1–4).  
- **`insert_element/3`:** Correctly handles insertion (lines 5–9).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm adheres to the insertion sort logic. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates when the input list is empty, and the intermediate steps correctly build the sorted list.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The test case does not involve probabilistic facts or negations. However, the implementation is compatible with ProbLog's probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used." No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not explicitly tested but compatible.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes list input. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may impact performance for very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors were detected in the tested scenario. For robustness, additional edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs) could be tested.  

**Word Count:** ~400 words.
