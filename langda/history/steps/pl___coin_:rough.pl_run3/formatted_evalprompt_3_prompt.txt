</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulating the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads after all tosses. The code uses recursion and probabilistic facts (`coin/1` and `heads/1`). The evaluation focuses on verifying logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Result:**  
  - **Error:** `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 9:17`  
  - **Failure:** The test failed due to an undefined implication operator (`->/2`).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate:** `coins_r/3`  
  - **Line Interval:** Lines 9–17 (implication `->/2` in the recursive rule).  
- **Issue:** The implication operator (`->/2`) is not correctly defined or supported in the current ProbLog context.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic (`coins_r/3`) is intended to count heads, but the use of `->/2` is syntactically incorrect in ProbLog. ProbLog does not natively support Prolog's implication operator.  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The base case (`coins_r(SC, SC, 0)`) is correct, but the recursive case fails due to the implication issue.  

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8)` is correctly defined.  
  - The negation/implication rules (`P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`) are not applicable here because the implication operator is misused.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the implication operator is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met for `coin/1` and `heads/1`, but the implication in `coins_r/3` breaks the probabilistic context.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined implication operator (`->/2`).  
  - Non-integer or negative `CNT` values could cause issues (not handled).  
  - Deep recursion performance is untested.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator        | Recursive logic fails           | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if/3` or separate clauses). |
| 2   | No handling for invalid `CNT`    | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation (e.g., `CNT >= 0`).   |
| 3   | Deep recursion untested          | Possible stack overflow         | Test with large `CNT` or add tail recursion. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code Suggestion**  
```problog
PH::make_coin(C, PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).
heads(C) :- coin(C), PH::make_coin(C, PH), PH.

coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(c1),
    ( heads(c1) ->
        NewSC is SC + 1,
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT)
    ;
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT)
    ).

total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).
```

**Note:** Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible constructs or redefine the logic using separate clauses.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
