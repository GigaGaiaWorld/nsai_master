### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`coin(C)`) a specified number of times (`CNT`) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads after `CNT` tosses. The code uses recursion (`coins_r/3`) to achieve this. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a **non-ground probabilistic clause** error. The error occurs at line 1:5, where the probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is not properly grounded. No queries were successfully executed due to this error.

**Failed Queries:**  
- `query(total(_))`: Failed with the error `NonGroundProbabilisticClause`.

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**  
- **Expected:** The query should return a probability distribution over possible values of `S` (total heads after 4 tosses).  
- **Actual:** The query fails with an error, preventing any results from being computed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate/Rule:** `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` (Line 1).  
  - **Issue:** The probabilistic fact is non-ground because `C` is not instantiated before being used in the probabilistic context.  

- **Code Block with Error:**  
  ```prolog
  PH::make_coin(C,PH).
  coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical reasoning, as it terminates when `CNT` reaches 0 and correctly accumulates the count of heads (`SC`).  
  - However, the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,PH)` is not grounded, violating ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).

- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**  
  - The error prevents the computation of probabilities for the coin tosses.  
  - The negation/implication rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are not applicable here, as the error occurs before any probabilistic reasoning can take place.

- **DeepProbLog Feature Usage:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the probabilistic fact is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic clause.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-ground Probabilistic Facts:** The primary issue is the non-ground probabilistic fact, which is a common oversight in ProbLog programming.  
  - **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth (`CNT`) is fixed (4), so performance is not a concern here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | Prevents execution of queries   | Instantiate `C` before using it in `PH::make_coin(C,PH)`. For example, define `coin(1).` or use a list of coins. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic clause, which is a fundamental error in ProbLog. Fixing this issue by grounding the probabilistic fact will allow the recursive logic to function as intended. The evaluation highlights the importance of ensuring all probabilistic facts are ground before execution.
