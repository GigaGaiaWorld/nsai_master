  "ErrorSummary": "Temperature threshold is hardcoded (100 A for ≥50°C) without dynamic adjustment based on input temperature. DeepProbLog features are not utilized.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify anomaly_detection/3 to accept temperature as an argument and dynamically set the threshold (e.g., anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, Temp, Result) :- (Temp >= 50 -> Threshold = 100 ; Threshold = 150), number(Digit1, Num1), number(Digit2, Num2), TotalCurrent is Num1 + Num2, (TotalCurrent > Threshold, Result = 1 ; TotalCurrent =< Threshold, Result = 0)).",
