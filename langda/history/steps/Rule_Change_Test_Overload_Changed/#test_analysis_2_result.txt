### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Anomaly Detection in Current-Carrying Capacity**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect anomalies in the total current-carrying capacity of two branches based on ambient temperature conditions. The code uses a neural network (`nn/4`) to classify digits and converts these digits into numerical values for further analysis. The anomaly detection logic is implemented in the `anomaly_detection/3` predicate, which checks if the sum of currents exceeds a specified threshold (100 A for temperatures ≥ 50 °C).

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic correctness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test cases were executed:

1. **Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_1, img_9], [img_5, img_5], 0)`  
   **Result**: `1.0000`  
   **Expected**: `1` (since 19 + 55 = 74 ≤ 100, but the result is incorrect)  
   **Status**: **Failed**

2. **Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_7], X2)`  
   **Result**: `0.0000`  
   **Expected**: `0` (since 51 + 57 = 108 > 100, but the result is correct)  
   **Status**: **Passed**

3. **Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1)`  
   **Result**: `1.0000`  
   **Expected**: `1` (since 95 + 59 = 154 > 100)  
   **Status**: **Passed**

**Summary**: One test case failed (Query 1).

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_1, img_9], [img_5, img_5], 0)`  
  - **Predicate with Error**: `anomaly_detection/3`  
  - **Code Line**: The entire rule for `anomaly_detection/3` is incorrect.  
  - **Issue**: The logic for converting digits to numbers (`number/2`) is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly concatenate digits (e.g., `[img_1, img_9]` should be 19, not 10).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog**:  
  - The `number/2` predicate does not correctly handle digit concatenation. It sums digits instead of treating them as a multi-digit number.  
  - Recursive termination is correct, but the logic is flawed.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or implications, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: The `nn/4` predicate is used, but the neural network output is correctly integrated into the logic. No issues here.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (flaw in digit conversion).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Correctly used for digit classification.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `anomaly_detection(img_1, img_5, X)`).  
  - The `number/2` predicate fails for multi-digit numbers.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect digit concatenation    | Wrong anomaly detection results | Fix `number/2` to concatenate digits correctly. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for lists.     |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The code requires fixes for digit concatenation and input validation. The DeepProbLog feature is correctly used, but the classical reasoning logic is flawed.
