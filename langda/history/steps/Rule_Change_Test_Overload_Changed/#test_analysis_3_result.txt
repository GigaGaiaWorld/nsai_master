### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Anomaly Detection

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Anomaly Detection in Current-Carrying Capacity**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect anomalies in the total current-carrying capacity of two branches based on ambient temperature conditions. The code uses a neural network (`nn/4`) to classify digits and converts these digits into numerical values (`number/2`). The `anomaly_detection/3` predicate evaluates whether the sum of the currents exceeds a specified threshold (100 A for temperatures ≥ 50 °C). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test cases were executed:  

| Query | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| `anomaly_detection([img_1, img_9], [img_5, img_5], 0)` | `1.0000` | `1.0000` | Pass |
| `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_7], X2)` | `0.0000` | `0.0000` | Pass |
| `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1)` | `1.0000` | `1.0000` | Pass |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the `anomaly_detection/3` predicate under the given temperature condition (52 °C).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test cases. The following predicates were verified:  
- `digit/2`: Correctly maps images to digits.  
- `number/2`: Accurately converts lists of digits to numerical values.  
- `anomaly_detection/3`: Properly evaluates the sum of currents against the threshold (100 A).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `number/2` predicate recursively converts digit lists to numbers, ensuring termination by decrementing the list length.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case (`number([], Result, Result)`) ensures termination.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not explicitly use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). The neural network output (`digit(X,Y)`) is deterministic in this context.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The `nn/4` predicate is used to classify digits, but the fusion with probabilistic reasoning is not demonstrated. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The `number/2` and `anomaly_detection/3` predicates perform deterministic calculations.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not utilized.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Partially met (only for digit classification).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The `number/2` predicate assumes list input; non-list inputs would fail.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the list length, posing no performance risk for small inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | DeepProbLog not fully utilized | Limited probabilistic reasoning | Extend with probabilistic rules or facts. |
| 2   | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for `number/2`. |
| 3   | Temperature condition hardcoded | Inflexible for dynamic conditions | Parameterize the threshold based on temperature. |

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The code meets classical reasoning requirements but lacks probabilistic and dynamic features. Edge cases and input validation should be addressed for robustness.
