### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Anomaly Detection Logic for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for detecting anomalies based on geographic coordinates. The logic varies depending on the user's location (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India, or Urdu regions). The system converts digit lists to numbers and applies specific anomaly detection rules. This report evaluates the correctness of the implementation, verifies test results, and ensures compliance with probabilistic and classical logic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test cases were executed:  
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1)` → **1.0000**  
2. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1)` → **0.0000**  
3. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1)` → **0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior for the given geographic-specific rules.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test cases. The following predicates were verified:  
- `number/3` and `number/2`: Correctly convert digit lists to numbers.  
- `anomaly_detection/3`: Correctly applies the Saudi Arabian overheating anomaly rule (`Temp ≥ 60°C AND Flow ≤ 20 L/min`).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `number/3` and `anomaly_detection/3` are logically sound. Recursive termination in `number/3` is ensured by the base case `number([], Result, Result)`.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) were violated.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The `nn/4` predicates (e.g., `arabic_net`, `telugu_net`) are correctly defined but unused in the tested anomaly detection logic.  
- **Verification:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., neural network fusion) are not utilized in the current test cases.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The rules for digit conversion and anomaly detection are correctly implemented.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context (no probabilistic facts used).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Defined but unused.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit lists. Non-list inputs or invalid digits (e.g., `[img_x]`) would cause errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion in `number/3` could be problematic for very long lists, but this is unlikely in practice.
