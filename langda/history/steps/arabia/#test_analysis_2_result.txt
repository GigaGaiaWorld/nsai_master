### **Code Evaluation Report: Anomaly Detection in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Anomaly Detection Logic in ProbLog for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for detecting anomalies based on geographic coordinates and digit inputs. The anomaly detection logic varies depending on the user's location (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India, or Urdu regions). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the test results.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.  
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1) = 1.0000`  
2. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1) = 0.0000`  
3. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior for the given geographic coordinate (24.7136° N, 46.6753° E), which corresponds to Saudi Arabia. The anomaly detection logic for Saudi Arabia checks if `Temp ≥ 60°C` and `Flow ≤ 20 L/min`, which explains the test outcomes.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:  
- `number/3` and `number/2`: Correctly convert digit lists to numbers.  
- `anomaly_detection/3`: Correctly implements the geographic-specific logic for Saudi Arabia.  

**Expansion Predicates:**  
No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) were used in the provided code.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive predicate `number/3` terminates correctly when the input list is empty.  
- The anomaly detection logic is deterministic and adheres to the geographic requirements.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations. The results are purely deterministic.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The `nn/4` predicates (e.g., `arabic_net`, `telugu_net`) are defined but not used in the anomaly detection logic.  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic correctly implements geographic-specific anomaly detection.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts used).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used in the anomaly detection logic.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (e.g., `img_9`). Non-list inputs or invalid digits would cause errors.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The `number/3` predicate handles lists of arbitrary length but could face performance issues with very long lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | DeepProbLog not used | Limited functionality | Integrate `nn/4` outputs into anomaly detection. |
| 2      | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for valid digit inputs. |
| 3      | Geographic logic limited to Saudi Arabia | Incomplete for other regions | Extend logic for Iraq, India, and Urdu regions. |

**Final Remarks:**  
The code meets the requirements for the given geographic coordinate (Saudi Arabia) but lacks extensibility for other regions and input validation. DeepProbLog features are unused, limiting the system's potential. Addressing these gaps would enhance robustness and functionality.
