<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Anomaly Detection in Current-Carrying Capacity**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to detect anomalies in the total current-carrying capacity of two branches based on ambient temperature conditions. The code integrates a neural network (`nn/4`) for digit recognition and classical Prolog rules for numerical conversion and anomaly detection. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify failures, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:95.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The query `anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, Result)` fails due to an undefined predicate `->/2`.

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**  
- Expected: The predicate `anomaly_detection/3` should evaluate the sum of currents and return `1` if the total exceeds 150 A (given ambient temperature ≤ 30 °C).  
- Actual: The query fails with an `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `anomaly_detection/3` (Line 10).  
- **Error Cause:** The use of the `->/2` operator is not correctly interpreted in the ProbLog context. ProbLog requires explicit handling of conditional logic, such as using `if-then-else` constructs or auxiliary predicates.  
- **Code Block with Error:**  
  ```prolog
  anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, Result) :- 
      number(Digit1, Num1), 
      number(Digit2, Num2), 
      TotalCurrent is Num1 + Num2, 
      (TotalCurrent > 150 -> Result = 1 ; Result = 0).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The logic for summing currents and comparing them to a threshold is correct in classical Prolog. However, the `->/2` operator is not directly supported in ProbLog for probabilistic reasoning.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not applicable here.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - The `nn/4` predicate is correctly defined for digit recognition, but its output is not fused with probabilistic reasoning.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The numerical conversion (`number/2`) works, but the anomaly detection fails due to the `->/2` issue.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Correctly defined but unused in probabilistic reasoning.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs to `number/2` are not handled.  
  - The recursive `number/3` predicate may face performance issues with deep recursion for large lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` in ProbLog      | Anomaly detection fails         | Replace `->/2` with `if-then-else` or auxiliary predicates. |
| 2   | Non-list input handling missing  | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for `number/2`.       |
| 3   | DeepProbLog unused               | No probabilistic fusion         | Integrate neural network output with probabilistic rules. |

---

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code requires modifications to handle conditional logic in ProbLog and address edge cases. The DeepProbLog feature remains unused, limiting the integration of neural network outputs with probabilistic reasoning.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
