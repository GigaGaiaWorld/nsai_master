### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, testing edge cases, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test case for the `insertion_sort/2` predicate is as follows:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The test passes, as the output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are correctly implemented, and the recursive logic adheres to the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `insertion_sort/2` predicate recursively sorts the tail of the list and inserts the head into the sorted sublist using `insert_element/3`.  
  - The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) ensures termination for empty lists.  
  - The `insert_element/3` predicate correctly handles insertion by comparing elements and placing them in the right position.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the list is progressively reduced in size until it becomes empty.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The provided code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)` computations).  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog recursion and insertion logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists may lead to stack overflow, but this is a general limitation of recursive algorithms in Prolog.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used in the code.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Consider iterative approaches for scalability. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog logic. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and scalability for large lists should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
