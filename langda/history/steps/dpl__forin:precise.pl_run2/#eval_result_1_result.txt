  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. The code correctly implements insertion sort and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases (non-list inputs, large lists) are not handled.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`) to handle non-list inputs. For scalability, consider documenting recursion limits or providing an iterative alternative.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
