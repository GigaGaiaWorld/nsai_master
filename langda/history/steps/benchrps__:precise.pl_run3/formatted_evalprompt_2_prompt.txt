</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the rules of the game, the calculation of results, and the determination of the winner based on a list of moves from two players. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, recursive termination, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate**: `determine_winner/3`  
  - **Error Location**: The error occurs in the definition of `determine_winner`, specifically around line 41.  
  - **Issue**: The predicate is not correctly defined or is missing clauses. The error suggests a malformed conditional statement (`->/2`).

- **Code Block with Error**:
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic (win, lose, draw).  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score based on the results list.  
  - The error lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, where the conditional logic (`->/2`) is not properly formatted or recognized by ProbLog.

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates correctly terminate for empty lists, ensuring no infinite recursion.

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features. The evaluation is purely classical.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The game logic (`result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correctly implemented.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input lists for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Empty Lists**: Handled correctly by `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Not an issue due to the simplicity of the game.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Malformed conditional in `determine_winner` | Predicate fails to execute | Correct the syntax of the conditional statement in `determine_winner/3`. |
| 2   | No clauses for `->/2`            | ProbLog cannot parse the predicate | Ensure the conditional is properly formatted or use an alternative approach. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the problematic `determine_winner/3` definition with:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The core logic of the rock-paper-scissors game is correctly implemented, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate contains a syntax error. Fixing the conditional statement will resolve the issue. The code meets classical reasoning requirements but does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be handled for robustness. 

**Word Count**: ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
