### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, where two players submit lists of moves (`P1Moves` and `P2Moves`), and the system determines the winner (`Winner`) based on the results of each round. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
**Query Tested:**
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000
```
**Analysis:**
- The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `'Player 2'` as the winner because:
  - `rock` loses to `paper` (twice).
  - `rock` beats `scissor` (once).
  - The net score is negative (`-1`), indicating `'Player 2'` wins.

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules function as intended:
- **`play/3`**: Correctly computes the results of each round.
- **`compute_score/2`**: Accurately calculates the cumulative score.
- **`determine_winner/3`**: Properly interprets the score to declare the winner.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog:**
- **Logical Correctness**: The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are logically sound and cover all possible move combinations.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.

**Probabilistic ProbLog:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`). Thus, no probabilistic analysis is required.
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Uneven Lists**: If the move lists are of unequal length, the behavior is undefined (no handling in `play/3`).
- **Performance**: Deep recursion for very long lists could impact performance, but this is unlikely in a game context.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Uneven move lists | Undefined behavior | Extend `play/3` to handle uneven lists (e.g., pad with `draw`). |
| 3      | Deep recursion | Performance | Consider iterative solutions for very long lists. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct for the tested scenario but could be improved for robustness.
