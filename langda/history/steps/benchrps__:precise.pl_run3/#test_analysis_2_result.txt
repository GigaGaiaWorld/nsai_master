### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the rules of the game, the calculation of results, and the determination of the winner based on a list of moves from two players. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, recursive termination, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate**: `determine_winner/3`  
  - **Error Location**: The error occurs in the definition of `determine_winner`, specifically around line 41.  
  - **Issue**: The predicate is not correctly defined or is missing clauses. The error suggests a malformed conditional statement (`->/2`).

- **Code Block with Error**:
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic (win, lose, draw).  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score based on the results list.  
  - The error lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, where the conditional logic (`->/2`) is not properly formatted or recognized by ProbLog.

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates correctly terminate for empty lists, ensuring no infinite recursion.

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features. The evaluation is purely classical.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The game logic (`result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correctly implemented.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input lists for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Empty Lists**: Handled correctly by `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Not an issue due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Malformed conditional in `determine_winner` | Predicate fails to execute | Correct the syntax of the conditional statement in `determine_winner/3`. |
| 2   | No clauses for `->/2`            | ProbLog cannot parse the predicate | Ensure the conditional is properly formatted or use an alternative approach. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the problematic `determine_winner/3` definition with:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The core logic of the rock-paper-scissors game is correctly implemented, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate contains a syntax error. Fixing the conditional statement will resolve the issue. The code meets classical reasoning requirements but does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be handled for robustness.
