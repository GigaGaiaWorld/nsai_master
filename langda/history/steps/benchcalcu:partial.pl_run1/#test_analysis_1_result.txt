#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition ProbLog Code: Functional and Logical Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The code enforces constraints such as unique digits, non-zero leading digits, and column-wise addition with carry propagation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the constraints and logic of the cryptoaddition problem.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures non-zero leading digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry.  
- `all_different/1`: Enforces uniqueness of digits.  

All predicates function as intended, and no errors were found in the code.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to the constraints of the cryptoaddition problem. The recursive `all_different/1` predicate terminates correctly for lists of finite length.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  

**DeepProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Neural Network Integration:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `all_different/1` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures valid input via `query_sum/1`.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to the number of digits (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is logically correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are suggested at this time.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

**Final Remarks:**  
The cryptoaddition ProbLog code is robust and passes all tests. Future work could explore extending the problem to include probabilistic constraints or DeepProbLog features for more complex scenarios.
