### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to the specified requirements, and ensure it handles edge cases and probabilistic scenarios appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
- **Result:**  
  `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The query successfully sorted the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Length Calculation and Boundary Check:**  
   - The `length(List, Len)` and `Len > 1` checks ensure recursive splitting only occurs for lists longer than 1.  
2. **Recursive Sorting:**  
   - The recursive calls `merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft)` and `merge_sort(Right, SortedRight)` correctly handle sublists.  
3. **Merging Sublists:**  
   - The `merge/3` predicate combines the sorted sublists into the final result.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
  - The implementation is logically correct. The recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`).  
  - The `split_list/3` predicate correctly divides the list into two halves using `length/2` and `append/3`.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The test case is deterministic (probability 1.0000), so no probabilistic facts or negations are involved.  
  - If probabilistic facts were included, the code would need to comply with rules like `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` and `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`.  

- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The merge sort algorithm is correctly implemented.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this test case.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Empty List:** Handled by `merge_sort([], [])`.  
  - **Single-Element List:** Handled by `merge_sort([X], [X])`.  
  - **Non-List Input:** Not explicitly checked, but ProbLog will fail gracefully due to type mismatches.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance depends on the Prolog engine’s tail-call optimization.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors were found in the provided test case. For broader use, additional tests with probabilistic facts and edge cases (e.g., large lists) are recommended.
