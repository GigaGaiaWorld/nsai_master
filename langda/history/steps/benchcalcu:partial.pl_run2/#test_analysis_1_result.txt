#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition ProbLog Code: Functional and Logical Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The code enforces constraints such as non-zero leading digits, unique digits for each variable, and correct column-wise addition with carry propagation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning (if any), and adherence to the problem requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 successful queries, each returning a probability of `1.0000`. Here is the summary:  

- **All tests passed (no failures)**  
  - The results confirm that the code correctly solves the cryptoaddition problem for the given test cases.  
  - No discrepancies were found between the expected and actual results.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected** in the provided test results.  
- **Verified predicates**:  
  - `leftdigit/1`: Ensures non-zero leading digits (lines 6–7).  
  - `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry (lines 12–16).  
  - `all_different/1`: Enforces uniqueness of digits (lines 8–11).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The code adheres to the problem constraints:  
    - Non-zero leading digits (`A`, `B`, `C`).  
    - Unique digits for all variables (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`).  
    - Correct arithmetic for column-wise addition (`sumdigit/5`).  
  - Recursive predicates (`all_different/1`) terminate correctly.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`).  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) is present.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: The code assumes valid digits (0–9) and does not handle non-integer inputs.  
- **Performance**: The `all_different/1` predicate may face performance issues for larger lists due to its recursive nature.

| Requirement            | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning    | Met         | Correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle with logical constraints.        |
| Probabilistic Reasoning| Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases and Improvements**  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs to `all_different/1` would fail.  
  - Deep recursion for larger digit sets could impact performance.  
- **Suggestions**:  
  - Add input validation for `digit/1` and `all_different/1`.  
  - Optimize `all_different/1` for scalability.
