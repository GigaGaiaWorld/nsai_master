### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, where two players submit lists of moves (`P1Moves` and `P2Moves`), and the system determines the winner based on the game's rules. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs. `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
    - Net score: `-1` (Player 2 wins).
  - **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3` are correctly defined and function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog:**
  - The logic is sound:
    - Recursive termination is ensured in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.
    - The `result/3` predicate correctly handles win, lose, and draw scenarios.
  - **Edge Cases:**
    - Empty lists (`play([], [], [])`) are correctly handled.
    - Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms) would fail, but this is not a requirement.
- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.
  - **DeepProbLog:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The game logic and winner determination are correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Inputs:** The code assumes lists as input; non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance is not an issue for typical game lengths.
  - **Undefined Moves:** If a move is not `rock`, `paper`, or `scissor`, the `result/3` predicate will fail.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Non-list inputs cause errors | Low | Add input validation or documentation. |
| 2   | Undefined moves cause failures | Low | Extend `move/1` or handle gracefully. |
| 3   | No probabilistic features used | N/A | Consider adding probabilistic rules for advanced scenarios. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. No failures were detected in the provided test case. The code is robust for typical use cases but could be extended for probabilistic or edge-case handling if needed.
