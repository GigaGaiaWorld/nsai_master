### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. It defines the game's rules, calculates the result of each round, and determines the winner based on the cumulative score. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the logic, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  The test failed with the error:
  ```
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
  problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically at line 41:77. The issue arises because the predicate is not correctly defined or terminated.
- **Code Block with Error:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :-
  ```
  The predicate is incomplete and lacks the necessary logic to compute the winner.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate is also correctly implemented for `win`, `lose`, and `draw` cases.
  - The error stems from the incomplete definition of `determine_winner/3`, which is missing its body.

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`). Thus, the evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning.
  - No probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated, as none are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core game logic (`result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate is incomplete.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input lists for `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incomplete `determine_winner/3` | Fails to compute the winner     | Complete the predicate by adding the missing logic to call `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. |
| 2   | No error handling for non-lists | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation to ensure `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists.          |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
To resolve the error, the `determine_winner/3` predicate should be completed as follows:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The core logic of the rock-paper-scissors game is correctly implemented, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate is incomplete, leading to the observed error. Once fixed, the code will correctly compute the winner based on the game results. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
