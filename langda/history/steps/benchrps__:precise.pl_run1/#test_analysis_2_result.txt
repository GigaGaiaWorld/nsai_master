### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, where two players' moves are compared to determine the winner. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `determine_winner/3`  
  - **Error Location**: The error occurs due to incorrect syntax in the `determine_winner` predicate. The `->` operator is not properly formatted or used.  
  - **Code Block**:  
    ```prolog
    determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
    ```
  - **Issue**: The `->` operator is not correctly parsed, likely due to missing parentheses or incorrect formatting.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are logically correct and handle the game rules properly.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score based on the results of each round.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The code meets the requirements for classical reasoning (comparing moves and determining results).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined moves are not handled explicitly.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` | Prevents the predicate from executing | Fix the `->` operator formatting or use `if-then-else` properly. |
| 2   | No handling of invalid moves     | May cause runtime errors       | Add validation for `move/1` predicates.    |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the `determine_winner` predicate with the following corrected version:  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
  play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
  compute_score(Results, Score), 
  (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
   Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
   Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The code is logically sound but contains a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate. Once fixed, it should work as intended. Edge cases like invalid moves should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
