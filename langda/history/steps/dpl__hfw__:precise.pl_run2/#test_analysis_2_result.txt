### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, ...]`) into their corresponding numerical results. The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `parse/2` to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze potential failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The result `0.0000` is incorrect for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`. The expected result should be approximately `-13.6667`.  
  **Conclusion**: The test fails.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect result.  
- **Root Cause**:  
  The `parse/2` predicate does not correctly handle operator precedence or associativity. Specifically, the rules for parsing arithmetic operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are not defined in a way that respects mathematical precedence.  
- **Code Line**:  
  The issue lies in the `parse/2` predicate definitions (e.g., `parse([N1, + | T], R)`). The current implementation processes operations left-to-right without considering precedence.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog**:  
  The logical correctness of the `parse/2` predicate is flawed due to the lack of operator precedence handling. Recursive termination is correct, but the logic does not produce the expected arithmetic results.  
- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:  
  The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code parses expressions but fails to compute them correctly due to precedence issues.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2`: Not applicable.  
  - Non-list input: Not handled (could cause runtime errors).  
  - Deep recursive performance: Not tested, but the recursion depth is manageable for typical expressions.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong arithmetic results        | Redefine `parse/2` to handle precedence.   |
| 2      | No handling of non-list input    | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.                       |
| 3      | DeepProbLog not used             | Limited functionality           | Consider integrating neural networks if needed. |

**Final Note**: The code requires revisions to handle operator precedence and edge cases. The current implementation is not functionally correct for complex arithmetic expressions.
