  "ErrorSummary": "The parse/2 predicate does not handle operator precedence or nested expressions, leading to incorrect results for complex arithmetic expressions.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Extend parse/2 to include rules for each operator with proper precedence handling. For example:\n1. Add parse([N1, +, N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 + N2, parse(T, R).\n2. Similarly for other operators (*, -, /).\n3. Ensure parentheses or nested expressions are handled by recursively parsing sub-expressions.",
