### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a scoring system to determine the winner based on a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test resulted in a `TimeoutError`, indicating that the evaluation process exceeded the allowed time limit. No explicit failure or success was recorded due to the timeout.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` timed out during execution.  
- **Affected Predicates**:  
  - `play/3` (lines 10–14)  
  - `compute_score/2` (lines 16–19)  
  - `determine_winner/3` (lines 21–25)  

The timeout suggests inefficiency or non-termination in the recursive predicates, particularly `play/3` or `compute_score/2`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**:  
    The rules for `beats/2` and `play/3` are logically correct, but the recursive termination condition in `play/3` may not handle all cases properly.  
  - **Recursive Termination**:  
    The base case `play([], [], [])` is correct, but the recursive case might not terminate if the input lists are not of equal length or if the logic is inefficient.  

- **Probabilistic Scenario**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
    "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic is correct, but the timeout indicates performance issues.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-List Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - **Unequal Move Lists**: The `play/3` predicate assumes lists of equal length, which may cause issues if violated.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The timeout suggests performance problems with large or unbalanced inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Timeout during execution | Prevents result verification    | Optimize recursion or add input validation. |
| 2   | No input validation      | May crash on invalid inputs     | Add checks for list length and move validity. |
| 3   | No probabilistic rules   | Limited to classical reasoning  | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed.  |

#### **8. Code Blocks**  
```prolog
% Win-lose relationships
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).

% Game result calculation
play([], [], []).
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    (beats(P1, P2), Result = win ;
    (beats(P2, P1), Result = lose ;
    Result = draw,
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).

% Score computation
compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.

% Determine winner
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, S),
    (S > 0, Winner = player1 ;
     S < 0, Winner = player2 ;
     S = 0, Winner = draw).
```

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The implementation is logically sound but suffers from performance issues and lacks input validation. Addressing these would improve robustness and usability.
