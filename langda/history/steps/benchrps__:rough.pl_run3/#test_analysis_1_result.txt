### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a predicate to determine the winner of a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 17:29.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `Winner = player2` (since `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a score of `-1`).  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to an undefined operator `->` in the context of ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 17:29 in the `play` predicate, where the `->` operator is used.  
  - **Issue:** The `->` operator is not natively supported in ProbLog for conditional logic in this context.  

- **Affected Predicate:**  
  - `play/3`: The recursive predicate to determine the outcome of each move.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `play` predicate attempts to use Prolog's `->` operator, which is not valid in ProbLog for this use case. ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic or logical constructs.  
  - The recursive termination is correct (`play([], [], [])`), but the conditional logic fails.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The game rules are correctly defined, but the `play` predicate fails due to unsupported syntax.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined moves are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog | Conditional logic fails         | Replace `->` with explicit `if-then-else` or use ProbLog-compatible syntax. |
| 2   | No error handling for invalid moves | Undefined behavior             | Add validation for `move/1` predicates before processing.                   |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation fails due to the use of unsupported Prolog syntax in ProbLog. Correcting the conditional logic and adding input validation will resolve the issues. The core game rules are correctly defined, but the execution logic needs adjustment.
