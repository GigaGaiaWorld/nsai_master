</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a predicate to determine the winner of a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 17:29.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `Winner = player2` (since `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a score of `-1`).  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to an undefined operator `->` in the context of ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 17:29 in the `play` predicate, where the `->` operator is used.  
  - **Issue:** The `->` operator is not natively supported in ProbLog for conditional logic in this context.  

- **Affected Predicate:**  
  - `play/3`: The recursive predicate to determine the outcome of each move.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `play` predicate attempts to use Prolog's `->` operator, which is not valid in ProbLog for this use case. ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic or logical constructs.  
  - The recursive termination is correct (`play([], [], [])`), but the conditional logic fails.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The game rules are correctly defined, but the `play` predicate fails due to unsupported syntax.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined moves are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the small input size.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog | Conditional logic fails         | Replace `->` with explicit `if-then-else` or use ProbLog-compatible syntax. |
| 2   | No error handling for invalid moves | Undefined behavior             | Add validation for `move/1` predicates before processing.                   |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation fails due to the use of unsupported Prolog syntax in ProbLog. Correcting the conditional logic and adding input validation will resolve the issues. The core game rules are correctly defined, but the execution logic needs adjustment.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
