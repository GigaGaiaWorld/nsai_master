</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a scoring system to determine the winner based on a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test resulted in a `TimeoutError`, indicating that the evaluation process exceeded the allowed time limit. No explicit failure or success was recorded due to the timeout.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` timed out during execution.  
- **Affected Predicates**:  
  - `play/3` (lines 10–14)  
  - `compute_score/2` (lines 16–19)  
  - `determine_winner/3` (lines 21–25)  

The timeout suggests inefficiency or non-termination in the recursive predicates, particularly `play/3` or `compute_score/2`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**:  
    The rules for `beats/2` and `play/3` are logically correct, but the recursive termination condition in `play/3` may not handle all cases properly.  
  - **Recursive Termination**:  
    The base case `play([], [], [])` is correct, but the recursive case might not terminate if the input lists are not of equal length or if the logic is inefficient.  

- **Probabilistic Scenario**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
    "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic is correct, but the timeout indicates performance issues.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-List Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - **Unequal Move Lists**: The `play/3` predicate assumes lists of equal length, which may cause issues if violated.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The timeout suggests performance problems with large or unbalanced inputs.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Timeout during execution | Prevents result verification    | Optimize recursion or add input validation. |
| 2   | No input validation      | May crash on invalid inputs     | Add checks for list length and move validity. |
| 3   | No probabilistic rules   | Limited to classical reasoning  | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed.  |

---

#### **8. Code Blocks**  
```prolog
% Win-lose relationships
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).

% Game result calculation
play([], [], []).
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    (beats(P1, P2), Result = win ;
    (beats(P2, P1), Result = lose ;
    Result = draw,
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).

% Score computation
compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.

% Determine winner
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, S),
    (S > 0, Winner = player1 ;
     S < 0, Winner = player2 ;
     S = 0, Winner = draw).
```

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The implementation is logically sound but suffers from performance issues and lacks input validation. Addressing these would improve robustness and usability.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
</Final_Answer>
