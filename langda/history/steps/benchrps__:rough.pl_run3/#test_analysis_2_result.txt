### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to:
- Define the game rules (moves and win/lose relationships).
- Simulate a game between two players and determine the winner based on their moves.
- Calculate the final score and declare the winner.

The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` resulted in an error:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 17:20.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
The error occurs in the `play/3` predicate, specifically at the line where the conditional logic (`->/2`) is used:
```prolog
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    (beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win ;
     beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose ;
     Result = draw),
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
```
**Issue:**
- The error indicates that the `->/2` operator is not recognized or improperly used in the ProbLog context. ProbLog may not support the same syntax as classical Prolog for conditionals.

**Line Number Interval:**
- The error is localized to the `play/3` predicate (lines 17–20 in the original code).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Logical Correctness:**
- The recursive termination in `play/3` is correct (base case `play([], [], [])`).
- The logic for determining `win`, `lose`, or `draw` is sound but syntactically incompatible with ProbLog.

**Probabilistic Context:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
- The error is purely syntactic and unrelated to probabilistic reasoning.

**DeepProbLog:**
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the syntax is incompatible with ProbLog.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., if `P1Moves` or `P2Moves` is not a list).
- Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `->/2` operator not recognized | Syntax error in ProbLog          | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible conditionals (e.g., `if-then-else`). |
| 2   | Non-list input handling      | Potential runtime error          | Add input validation for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves`.                          |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation fails due to a syntactic incompatibility with ProbLog's conditional operator. The logic is otherwise correct. To fix the issue:
1. Replace `->/2` with a ProbLog-compatible conditional construct.
2. Add input validation for edge cases.
