  "ErrorSummary": "Timeout during execution due to potential inefficiency in recursion or missing input validation. The play/3 predicate may not handle unequal list lengths properly.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation to ensure lists are of equal length before calling play/3. 2. Optimize the recursive predicates to avoid deep recursion. 3. Add a check for valid moves (rock, paper, scissor) in play/3.",
