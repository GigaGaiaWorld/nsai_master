{
  "HASH": "DA97FB01",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. The implementation correctly handles the provided test case and adheres to the insertion sort algorithm. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion for large lists are not addressed.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`) to handle non-list inputs. 2. Consider optimizing for tail recursion or iterative approaches for large lists to prevent stack overflow.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
