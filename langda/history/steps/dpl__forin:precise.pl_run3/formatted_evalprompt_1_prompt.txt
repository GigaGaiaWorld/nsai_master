</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules. The evaluation also checks for edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```problog
  query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```problog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `insertion_sort/2`: Correctly implements recursive sorting and insertion.  
  - `insert_element/3`: Properly handles insertion of elements into a sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `insertion_sort/2` predicate recursively sorts the tail of the list and inserts the head into the sorted tail, adhering to the insertion sort algorithm.  
  - The `insert_element/3` predicate correctly places the element in the sorted list by comparing it with each element until the correct position is found.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.  
  - The recursive case reduces the problem size by processing the tail of the list, ensuring termination for finite lists.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The test case does not involve probabilistic facts or negations. Thus, no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) were applied.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list using classical Prolog recursion and insertion logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this test case.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion for large lists may cause stack overflow or performance issues.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) were used or required.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Optimize or use tail recursion if possible. |

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words  

**Final Remarks**:  
The insertion sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and performance for large lists should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features were used in this example.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
