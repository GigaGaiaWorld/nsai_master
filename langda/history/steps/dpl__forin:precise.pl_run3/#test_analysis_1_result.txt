### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules. The evaluation also checks for edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```problog
  query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```problog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `insertion_sort/2`: Correctly implements recursive sorting and insertion.  
  - `insert_element/3`: Properly handles insertion of elements into a sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `insertion_sort/2` predicate recursively sorts the tail of the list and inserts the head into the sorted tail, adhering to the insertion sort algorithm.  
  - The `insert_element/3` predicate correctly places the element in the sorted list by comparing it with each element until the correct position is found.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.  
  - The recursive case reduces the problem size by processing the tail of the list, ensuring termination for finite lists.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The test case does not involve probabilistic facts or negations. Thus, no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) were applied.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list using classical Prolog recursion and insertion logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this test case.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion for large lists may cause stack overflow or performance issues.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) were used or required.

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Optimize or use tail recursion if possible. |

**Final Remarks**:  
The insertion sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and performance for large lists should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features were used in this example.
