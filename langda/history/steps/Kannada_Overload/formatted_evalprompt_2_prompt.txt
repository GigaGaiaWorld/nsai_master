<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: Anomaly Detection in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Anomaly Detection Logic in ProbLog for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for detecting anomalies based on geographic coordinates. The system uses neural networks to recognize digits in different languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) and applies specific anomaly detection logic depending on the user's location. The current user is located in Mysore, Karnataka, India (12.2958° N, 76.6394° E), which triggers the "power overload anomaly" logic (sum of branch currents > 150A).

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided are as follows:
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1) = 0.0000`
2. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1) = 0.0000`
3. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1) = 1.0000`

**Verification:**
- **Test 1:** `[img_9, img_1]` converts to `91`, `[img_1, img_5]` converts to `15`. Sum = `106` (≤ 150). Expected result: `0`. **PASS**.
- **Test 2:** `[img_5, img_1]` converts to `51`, `[img_5, img_1]` converts to `51`. Sum = `102` (≤ 150). Expected result: `0`. **PASS**.
- **Test 3:** `[img_9, img_5]` converts to `95`, `[img_5, img_9]` converts to `59`. Sum = `154` (> 150). Expected result: `1`. **PASS**.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The anomaly detection logic for India (sum of branch currents > 150A) is correctly implemented.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `number/3` predicate correctly converts digit lists to numbers, and the `anomaly_detection/3` rule accurately checks the sum condition.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Integration:** The `nn/4` predicates are used to define neural networks for digit recognition, but the current test cases do not involve probabilistic reasoning with neural outputs. **DeepProbLog feature not used in this context.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic for converting digits and checking the sum is correct.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Partially met (defined but not tested in probabilistic scenarios).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs to `number/3` would fail (e.g., `number(abc, X)`).
  - Deep recursion in `number/3` could be problematic for very long lists (performance issue).
  - Undefined cases (e.g., invalid digit images) are not handled.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Non-list input to `number/3` | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2   | Deep recursion in `number/3` | Performance issue | Optimize or limit list length. |
| 3   | Undefined digit images | Unpredictable behavior | Add default cases or error handling. |

---

**Word Count:** 450  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code meets the requirements for the given test cases but should address edge cases for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
