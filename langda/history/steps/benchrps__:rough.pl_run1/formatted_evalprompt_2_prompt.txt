</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a predicate to determine the winner based on a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 17:21.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `Winner = player2` (since `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once).  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to an undefined operator `->` in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 17:21 in the `play/3` predicate.  
  - The error arises from the use of the `->` operator, which is not natively supported in ProbLog for conditional logic.  

- **Affected Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
      ( beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win
      ; (beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose
      ; Result = draw
      )),
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The logic for determining the game outcome (`win`, `lose`, `draw`) is correct but improperly implemented in ProbLog.  
  - ProbLog does not support the `->` operator for conditional branching. Instead, it requires explicit rules or probabilistic facts.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly terminated with base cases.  

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not used** in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the implementation fails due to unsupported syntax.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs or mismatched move lists are not handled.  
  - The `->` operator is a critical oversight in ProbLog syntax.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator       | Code execution fails            | Replace with ProbLog-compatible conditionals (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No error handling for edge cases | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation (e.g., check list lengths). |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The code's logic is sound, but the implementation must adhere to ProbLog's syntax constraints. Addressing the `->` operator issue will resolve the primary failure.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
