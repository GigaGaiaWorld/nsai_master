</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the game rules, the logic for determining the winner, and the handling of edge cases. The evaluation also checks for compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```

**Test Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], draw) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player1) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
The results are contradictory because the sum of probabilities exceeds 1.0 (3.0 in total). This indicates a logical error in the implementation.  

**Conclusion:**  
- **Failures Detected:** The test results are inconsistent with the expected behavior of the game.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically in the way the `compute_score/2` predicate is used to calculate the winner. The logic does not correctly handle the aggregation of results.  

**Code Block with Error:**  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, S),
    (S > 0, Winner = player1;
     S < 0, Winner = player2;
     S = 0, Winner = draw).
```

**Issue:**  
- The `compute_score/2` predicate does not account for the probabilistic nature of the results, leading to incorrect aggregation.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
- The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct.  
- The logical error arises from the incorrect handling of the `Results` list in `determine_winner/3`.  

**Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
- The current implementation does not comply with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). The results should sum to 1.0, but they sum to 3.0.  

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- **Not Used:** The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The game rules are correctly defined, but the winner determination logic is flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The results do not comply with probabilistic rules.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** Not handled. The code assumes inputs are lists.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not tested, but the recursion depth is limited by the input size.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Incorrect aggregation of results in `determine_winner/3` | Results are contradictory | Modify `compute_score/2` to ensure probabilities sum to 1.0 |
| 2   | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists |
| 3   | Probabilistic rules not followed | Incorrect probability calculations | Ensure results comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Note:**  
The implementation requires corrections to handle probabilistic results correctly and to ensure logical consistency. Edge cases should also be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
