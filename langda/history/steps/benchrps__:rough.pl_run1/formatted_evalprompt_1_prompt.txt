</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the logical correctness of the game rules, the recursive termination of predicates, and the handling of edge cases. The code includes predicates for defining moves, determining wins/losses, and computing the final score. The test query aims to determine the winner of a sequence of moves.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 17:21.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed due to an undefined predicate or syntax error.
- **Error Location**:  
  The error points to line 17, column 21, where the `->` operator is used incorrectly or without proper context. The issue lies in the `play/3` predicate's conditional logic.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `play/3` predicate uses conditional logic (`->`) to determine the game outcome. However, the error suggests that the syntax or structure of the conditional is incorrect. In ProbLog, the `->` operator must be used within a valid rule body.
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly structured, but the error prevents execution.
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails due to syntax error).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion could cause performance issues for long move sequences.  
  - The `play/3` predicate assumes valid moves, but invalid inputs are not checked.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `play/3`         | Prevents execution of the query | Correct the conditional logic syntax in `play/3`. |
| 2   | No input validation              | May cause runtime errors        | Add checks for valid moves and list inputs. |
| 3   | No probabilistic features used   | Limited functionality           | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the problematic `play/3` predicate with the following corrected version:
```prolog
play([], [], []).
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    ( beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win
    ; (beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose
    ; Result = draw
    ),
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
```

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Logic**: Clear and structured.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
