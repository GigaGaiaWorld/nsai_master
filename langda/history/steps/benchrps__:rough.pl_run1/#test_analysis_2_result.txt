### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a predicate to determine the winner based on a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 17:21.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `Winner = player2` (since `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once).  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to an undefined operator `->` in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 17:21 in the `play/3` predicate.  
  - The error arises from the use of the `->` operator, which is not natively supported in ProbLog for conditional logic.  

- **Affected Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
      ( beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win
      ; (beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose
      ; Result = draw
      )),
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The logic for determining the game outcome (`win`, `lose`, `draw`) is correct but improperly implemented in ProbLog.  
  - ProbLog does not support the `->` operator for conditional branching. Instead, it requires explicit rules or probabilistic facts.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly terminated with base cases.  

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not used** in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the implementation fails due to unsupported syntax.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs or mismatched move lists are not handled.  
  - The `->` operator is a critical oversight in ProbLog syntax.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator       | Code execution fails            | Replace with ProbLog-compatible conditionals (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No error handling for edge cases | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation (e.g., check list lengths). |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The code's logic is sound, but the implementation must adhere to ProbLog's syntax constraints. Addressing the `->` operator issue will resolve the primary failure.
