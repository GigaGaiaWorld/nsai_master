### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the game rules, the logic for determining the winner, and the handling of edge cases. The evaluation also checks for compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```

**Test Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], draw) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player1) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
The results are contradictory because the sum of probabilities exceeds 1.0 (3.0 in total). This indicates a logical error in the implementation.  

**Conclusion:**  
- **Failures Detected:** The test results are inconsistent with the expected behavior of the game.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically in the way the `compute_score/2` predicate is used to calculate the winner. The logic does not correctly handle the aggregation of results.  

**Code Block with Error:**  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, S),
    (S > 0, Winner = player1;
     S < 0, Winner = player2;
     S = 0, Winner = draw).
```

**Issue:**  
- The `compute_score/2` predicate does not account for the probabilistic nature of the results, leading to incorrect aggregation.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
- The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct.  
- The logical error arises from the incorrect handling of the `Results` list in `determine_winner/3`.  

**Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
- The current implementation does not comply with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). The results should sum to 1.0, but they sum to 3.0.  

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- **Not Used:** The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The game rules are correctly defined, but the winner determination logic is flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The results do not comply with probabilistic rules.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** Not handled. The code assumes inputs are lists.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not tested, but the recursion depth is limited by the input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Incorrect aggregation of results in `determine_winner/3` | Results are contradictory | Modify `compute_score/2` to ensure probabilities sum to 1.0 |
| 2   | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists |
| 3   | Probabilistic rules not followed | Incorrect probability calculations | Ensure results comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` |

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Note:**  
The implementation requires corrections to handle probabilistic results correctly and to ensure logical consistency. Edge cases should also be addressed for robustness.
