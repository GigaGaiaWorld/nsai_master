### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the logical correctness of the game rules, the recursive termination of predicates, and the handling of edge cases. The code includes predicates for defining moves, determining wins/losses, and computing the final score. The test query aims to determine the winner of a sequence of moves.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 17:21.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed due to an undefined predicate or syntax error.
- **Error Location**:  
  The error points to line 17, column 21, where the `->` operator is used incorrectly or without proper context. The issue lies in the `play/3` predicate's conditional logic.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `play/3` predicate uses conditional logic (`->`) to determine the game outcome. However, the error suggests that the syntax or structure of the conditional is incorrect. In ProbLog, the `->` operator must be used within a valid rule body.
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly structured, but the error prevents execution.
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails due to syntax error).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion could cause performance issues for long move sequences.  
  - The `play/3` predicate assumes valid moves, but invalid inputs are not checked.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `play/3`         | Prevents execution of the query | Correct the conditional logic syntax in `play/3`. |
| 2   | No input validation              | May cause runtime errors        | Add checks for valid moves and list inputs. |
| 3   | No probabilistic features used   | Limited functionality           | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the problematic `play/3` predicate with the following corrected version:
```prolog
play([], [], []).
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    ( beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win
    ; (beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose
    ; Result = draw
    ),
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
```
