<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Anomaly Detection in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `anomaly_detection` in ProbLog for Engine Overheating Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an anomaly detection system for an engine cooling circuit. The goal is to detect overheating risks by evaluating temperature and coolant flow rates. The system uses a neural network (`mnist_net`) to recognize digits from images and translates them into numerical values for comparison. The anomaly is flagged if the temperature is ≥ 80 ℃ and the flow rate is ≤ 20 L/min.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test cases were executed:  
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1)`  
   - **Result**: `1.0000` (Pass)  
   - **Explanation**: The temperature is 91 ℃ (≥ 80) and the flow is 15 L/min (≤ 20), so the anomaly is correctly detected.  

2. `anomaly_detection([img_7, img_5], [img_5, img_5], 0)`  
   - **Result**: `1.0000` (Pass)  
   - **Explanation**: The temperature is 75 ℃ (< 80) and the flow is 55 L/min (> 20), so no anomaly is detected.  

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test cases. The predicates and rules function as expected:  
- `number/2` correctly translates digit sequences into numerical values.  
- `anomaly_detection/3` accurately evaluates the conditions for anomaly detection.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
- The recursive predicate `number/3` terminates correctly when the input list is empty.  
- The logical conditions in `anomaly_detection/3` (`Temp >= 80, Flow =< 20`) are correctly implemented.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  

**DeepProbLog Integration**:  
- The neural network `mnist_net` is correctly integrated via the `digit/2` predicate to recognize digits.  
- **Verification**: The fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements**:  
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The logic for anomaly detection is correctly implemented.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts used).  
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Met. The `digit/2` predicate successfully translates image inputs into numerical values.  

**Edge Cases**:  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Digit1` and `Digit2` are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input list, which is manageable for typical use cases.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog features not fully utilized | Limited probabilistic reasoning | Consider adding probabilistic rules for uncertainty handling. |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**: The code meets the specified requirements and passes all test cases. Minor improvements could enhance robustness and functionality.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
