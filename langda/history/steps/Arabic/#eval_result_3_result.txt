{
  "HASH": "784BB675",
  "ErrorSummary": "Incorrect handling of numerical comparisons in anomaly detection logic, leading to false positives/negatives. DeepProbLog feature not utilized.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Modify the anomaly_detection/4 rule to handle leading zeros (e.g., ensure '01' is treated as 1). 2. Add input validation for non-list inputs. 3. Consider integrating neural network output with probabilistic rules if DeepProbLog is required.",
