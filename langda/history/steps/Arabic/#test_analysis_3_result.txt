### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Anomaly Detection

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Engine Anomaly Detection**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect anomalies in an engine cooling system based on three parameters: temperature, coolant flow rate, and pressure. The anomaly is flagged if the temperature is ≥ 80 ℃, the flow rate is ≤ 20 L/min, and the pressure is ≥ 15 bar. The code uses a neural network (`mnist_net`) to recognize digits from images and converts them into numerical values for comparison.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with the functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test cases were executed:

1. **Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], [img_0, img_1], 1)`  
   **Result**: `0.0000`  
   **Expected**: `1.0000` (since `91` ≥ 80, `15` ≤ 20, and `01` ≥ 15 should trigger an anomaly)  
   **Status**: **Failed**

2. **Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_7, img_5], [img_5, img_5], [img_1, img_0], 0)`  
   **Result**: `1.0000`  
   **Expected**: `0.0000` (since `75` < 80, `55` > 20, and `10` < 15 should not trigger an anomaly)  
   **Status**: **Failed**

**Conclusion**: Both test cases failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query 1**:  
  - **Predicate**: `anomaly_detection/4`  
  - **Issue**: The condition `Pressure >= 15` is not satisfied because `01` is interpreted as `1`, which is less than 15.  
  - **Code Line**: The rule defining `anomaly_detection/4`.

- **Failed Query 2**:  
  - **Predicate**: `anomaly_detection/4`  
  - **Issue**: The condition `Temp >= 80` is not satisfied because `75` is less than 80.  
  - **Code Line**: The rule defining `anomaly_detection/4`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog**:  
  - The recursive predicate `number/3` correctly converts lists of digits into numerical values. However, the anomaly detection logic in `anomaly_detection/4` does not account for leading zeros (e.g., `01` is treated as `1`).  
  - The termination condition for `number/3` is correct.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: The `nn/4` predicate is used to interface with `mnist_net`, but the neural network's output is not fused with probabilistic reasoning.  
    - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The digit-to-number conversion works, but the anomaly detection logic fails due to incorrect handling of numerical comparisons.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: The `nn/4` predicate is correctly defined but not integrated with probabilistic reasoning.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Leading zeros in digit lists (e.g., `[img_0, img_1]`) are not handled correctly.  
  - Non-list inputs are not validated.  
  - Deep recursive performance is not an issue here due to small input sizes.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect handling of `Pressure` | False negatives in anomaly detection | Treat `01` as `1` or pad inputs to avoid leading zeros. |
| 2   | Incorrect handling of `Temp`     | False positives in anomaly detection | Ensure numerical comparisons are accurate. |
| 3   | DeepProbLog not used             | Limited probabilistic reasoning  | Integrate neural network output with probabilistic rules if required. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.

**Final Note**: The code requires fixes in the anomaly detection logic and better handling of edge cases. The DeepProbLog feature is unused, which limits the probabilistic capabilities of the solution.
