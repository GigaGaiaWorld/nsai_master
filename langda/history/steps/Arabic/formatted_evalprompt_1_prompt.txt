<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Anomaly Detection

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Engine Anomaly Detection**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect anomalies in an engine cooling system by evaluating temperature and coolant flow rates. The anomaly is flagged if the temperature is ≥ 80 ℃ and the flow rate is ≤ 20 L/min. The code uses a neural network (`mnist_net`) to translate digit inputs into numerical values and then applies logical rules to determine the anomaly.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 9:29.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, Result)` failed due to an undefined predicate or syntax error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** The error occurs in the `anomaly_detection` rule at line 9.
- **Code Block with Error:**
  ```prolog
  anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, Result) :- 
      number(Digit1, Temp),
      number(Digit2, Flow),
      (Temp >= 80, Flow =< 20 -> Result = 1 ; Result = 0).
  ```
- **Issue:** The error suggests a syntax or predicate definition problem, likely due to an undefined operator or malformed rule.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The logic for anomaly detection (`Temp >= 80, Flow =< 20`) is correct.
  - The recursive termination in `number/3` is valid as it handles the base case (`number([],Result,Result)`) and recursive case (`number([H|T],Acc,Result)`).
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not explicitly use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic violations are present.
- **DeepProbLog Integration:**
  - The `nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) :: digit(X,Y)` predicate integrates a neural network for digit recognition. However, the error prevents further evaluation of this integration.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logic is correct, but execution fails).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules used).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Correctly defined but not tested due to the error.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs to `number/3` are not handled.
  - Deep recursive performance is not an issue here due to the small input size.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined predicate or syntax error in `anomaly_detection` | Execution fails | Verify the syntax of the `anomaly_detection` rule and ensure all predicates are defined. |
| 2      | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation for `number/3` to handle non-list inputs gracefully.  |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code's logic is sound, but a syntax or predicate definition error prevents execution. Addressing the error and adding input validation will resolve the issues.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
