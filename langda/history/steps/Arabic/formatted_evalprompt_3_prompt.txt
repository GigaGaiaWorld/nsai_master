<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Anomaly Detection

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Engine Anomaly Detection**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect anomalies in an engine cooling system based on three parameters: temperature, coolant flow rate, and pressure. The anomaly is flagged if the temperature is ≥ 80 ℃, the flow rate is ≤ 20 L/min, and the pressure is ≥ 15 bar. The code uses a neural network (`mnist_net`) to recognize digits from images and converts them into numerical values for comparison.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with the functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test cases were executed:

1. **Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], [img_0, img_1], 1)`  
   **Result**: `0.0000`  
   **Expected**: `1.0000` (since `91` ≥ 80, `15` ≤ 20, and `01` ≥ 15 should trigger an anomaly)  
   **Status**: **Failed**

2. **Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_7, img_5], [img_5, img_5], [img_1, img_0], 0)`  
   **Result**: `1.0000`  
   **Expected**: `0.0000` (since `75` < 80, `55` > 20, and `10` < 15 should not trigger an anomaly)  
   **Status**: **Failed**

**Conclusion**: Both test cases failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query 1**:  
  - **Predicate**: `anomaly_detection/4`  
  - **Issue**: The condition `Pressure >= 15` is not satisfied because `01` is interpreted as `1`, which is less than 15.  
  - **Code Line**: The rule defining `anomaly_detection/4`.

- **Failed Query 2**:  
  - **Predicate**: `anomaly_detection/4`  
  - **Issue**: The condition `Temp >= 80` is not satisfied because `75` is less than 80.  
  - **Code Line**: The rule defining `anomaly_detection/4`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog**:  
  - The recursive predicate `number/3` correctly converts lists of digits into numerical values. However, the anomaly detection logic in `anomaly_detection/4` does not account for leading zeros (e.g., `01` is treated as `1`).  
  - The termination condition for `number/3` is correct.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: The `nn/4` predicate is used to interface with `mnist_net`, but the neural network's output is not fused with probabilistic reasoning.  
    - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The digit-to-number conversion works, but the anomaly detection logic fails due to incorrect handling of numerical comparisons.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: The `nn/4` predicate is correctly defined but not integrated with probabilistic reasoning.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Leading zeros in digit lists (e.g., `[img_0, img_1]`) are not handled correctly.  
  - Non-list inputs are not validated.  
  - Deep recursive performance is not an issue here due to small input sizes.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect handling of `Pressure` | False negatives in anomaly detection | Treat `01` as `1` or pad inputs to avoid leading zeros. |
| 2   | Incorrect handling of `Temp`     | False positives in anomaly detection | Ensure numerical comparisons are accurate. |
| 3   | DeepProbLog not used             | Limited probabilistic reasoning  | Integrate neural network output with probabilistic rules if required. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

--- 

**Final Note**: The code requires fixes in the anomaly detection logic and better handling of edge cases. The DeepProbLog feature is unused, which limits the probabilistic capabilities of the solution.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
