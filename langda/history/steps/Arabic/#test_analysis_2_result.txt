### Code Evaluation Report: Anomaly Detection in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `anomaly_detection` in ProbLog for Engine Overheating Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an anomaly detection system for an engine cooling circuit. The goal is to detect overheating risks by evaluating temperature and coolant flow rates. The system uses a neural network (`mnist_net`) to recognize digits from images and translates them into numerical values for comparison. The anomaly is flagged if the temperature is ≥ 80 ℃ and the flow rate is ≤ 20 L/min.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test cases were executed:  
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1)`  
   - **Result**: `1.0000` (Pass)  
   - **Explanation**: The temperature is 91 ℃ (≥ 80) and the flow is 15 L/min (≤ 20), so the anomaly is correctly detected.  

2. `anomaly_detection([img_7, img_5], [img_5, img_5], 0)`  
   - **Result**: `1.0000` (Pass)  
   - **Explanation**: The temperature is 75 ℃ (< 80) and the flow is 55 L/min (> 20), so no anomaly is detected.  

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test cases. The predicates and rules function as expected:  
- `number/2` correctly translates digit sequences into numerical values.  
- `anomaly_detection/3` accurately evaluates the conditions for anomaly detection.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
- The recursive predicate `number/3` terminates correctly when the input list is empty.  
- The logical conditions in `anomaly_detection/3` (`Temp >= 80, Flow =< 20`) are correctly implemented.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  

**DeepProbLog Integration**:  
- The neural network `mnist_net` is correctly integrated via the `digit/2` predicate to recognize digits.  
- **Verification**: The fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements**:  
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The logic for anomaly detection is correctly implemented.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts used).  
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Met. The `digit/2` predicate successfully translates image inputs into numerical values.  

**Edge Cases**:  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Digit1` and `Digit2` are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input list, which is manageable for typical use cases.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog features not fully utilized | Limited probabilistic reasoning | Consider adding probabilistic rules for uncertainty handling. |
