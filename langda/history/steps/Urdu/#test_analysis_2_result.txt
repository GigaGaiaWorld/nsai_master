### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Anomaly Detection

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Anomaly Detection Code for Network Security Monitoring**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements an anomaly detection system for network security monitoring. The scenario involves detecting anomalies where the "source IP (X) equals destination IP (Y)" in network traffic. The code translates digits from a neural network (`mnist_net`) into real numbers and checks for equality between two digits (`Digit1` and `Digit2`). The result (`Result`) is `1` if an anomaly is detected (i.e., `X =:= Y`) and `0` otherwise.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the test results.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.  
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test cases were executed:  

1. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1)`  
   - **Result:** `1.0000`  
   - **Expected:** `1` (anomaly detected)  
   - **Status:** Passed  

2. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_0], [img_7, img_0], 0)`  
   - **Result:** `1.0000`  
   - **Expected:** `0` (no anomaly)  
   - **Status:** **Failed**  

**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures):** False.  
- **Failed Query:** `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_0], [img_7, img_0], 0)` returned `1.0000` instead of `0`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_0], [img_7, img_0], 0)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `0` (no anomaly).  
  - **Actual Result:** `1.0000` (incorrectly flagged as anomaly).  

- **Error Location:**  
  - The issue lies in the `anomaly_detection/3` predicate, specifically in the comparison logic (`X =:= Y`).  
  - The predicate incorrectly returns `1` when `X` and `Y` are not equal.  

- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, Result) :- 
      number(Digit1, X),
      number(Digit2, Y),
      (X =:= Y, Result = 1 ; X =\= Y, Result = 0).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The predicate `anomaly_detection/3` is logically flawed. The disjunction (`;`) is incorrectly structured, leading to incorrect results when `X` and `Y` are not equal.  
  - **Fix:** The predicate should explicitly enforce `Result = 0` when `X =\= Y`.  

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic for anomaly detection is flawed.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes `Digit1` and `Digit2` are lists. Non-list inputs may cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** The `number/3` predicate uses recursion, but the depth is limited by the input size (no performance issues expected).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect anomaly detection logic | False positives in anomaly detection | Restructure the `anomaly_detection/3` predicate to correctly handle `X =\= Y`. |
| 2   | Non-list input handling          | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation for `Digit1` and `Digit2`. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code requires fixes to the `anomaly_detection/3` predicate to ensure correct anomaly detection. Edge cases like non-list inputs should also be addressed for robustness. No DeepProbLog features are used in the current implementation.
