### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Anomaly Detection

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Multi-Language Digit Recognition and Anomaly Detection**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines neural networks for digit recognition in multiple languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) and implements anomaly detection logic based on geographic coordinates. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and neural network integration).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the `anomaly_detection` predicate are as follows:  
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1) = 0.0000`  
2. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1) = 1.0000`  
3. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1) = 0.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- All tests pass as expected.  
  - The first and third queries return `0.0000` because the source and destination IPs (or other parameters) do not match the anomaly conditions.  
  - The second query returns `1.0000` because the source and destination IPs are identical, triggering the anomaly condition for Urdu regions (Pakistan).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests pass, there are no failures to localize. However, the following predicates and rules were verified:  
- `number/3` and `number/2`: Correctly convert digit lists to numbers.  
- `anomaly_detection/3`: Correctly implements the anomaly logic for Urdu regions (Pakistan).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `number` predicate correctly handles recursion and termination.  
- **Anomaly Detection:** The logic for Urdu regions is correctly implemented, checking if the source and destination IPs are equal.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not explicitly use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The `nn/4` predicates define neural networks for digit recognition, but their outputs are not explicitly used in the anomaly detection logic.  
- **Conclusion:** DeepProbLog features are partially used (for digit recognition) but not integrated into the anomaly detection logic.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The `number` and `anomaly_detection` predicates work as expected.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not explicitly used.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Partially met. Neural networks are defined but not fully integrated into the anomaly detection logic.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit lists as input. Non-list inputs or undefined digits may cause errors.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The `number` predicate handles recursion efficiently for small lists but may face performance issues with very long lists.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | DeepProbLog not fully integrated | Limited use of neural networks  | Integrate neural network outputs into anomaly logic. |
| 2      | Edge cases not handled           | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for digit lists.       |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The code meets classical reasoning requirements and passes all tests. However, it could benefit from deeper integration of DeepProbLog features and better handling of edge cases.
