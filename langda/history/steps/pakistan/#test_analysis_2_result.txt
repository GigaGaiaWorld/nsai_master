### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Anomaly Detection Logic for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for detecting anomalies based on geographic coordinates and digit conversions. The system uses neural networks to recognize digits in different languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) and applies specific anomaly detection rules depending on the user's location. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test cases were executed:  

| Query | Result (Probability) | Expected Result | Pass/Fail |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1)` | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | Pass |
| `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1)` | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | Pass |
| `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1)` | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | Pass |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the anomaly detection logic for the given geographic region (Urdu regions, Pakistan).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:  
- `number/3` and `number/2`: Correctly convert digit lists to numbers.  
- `anomaly_detection/3`: Correctly implements the network traffic anomaly logic for Urdu regions (Pakistan).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `number/3` and `number/2` are logically sound and terminate correctly for valid inputs.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `number/3` terminates when the input list is empty.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not explicitly use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The `nn/4` predicates are correctly defined for digit recognition in different languages. However, the current anomaly detection logic does not utilize neural network outputs directly.  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used" for anomaly detection.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The anomaly detection logic correctly implements geographic-specific rules.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Partially met. The `nn/4` predicates are defined but not actively used in the anomaly detection logic.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit lists as input. Non-list inputs or unrecognized digits may cause errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for long digit lists could impact performance, but this is not tested here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | DeepProbLog not used for anomaly detection | Limited functionality | Integrate neural network outputs into anomaly detection logic. |
| 2   | No input validation for `number/2` | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for valid digit lists. |
| 3   | Geographic rules are hardcoded | Inflexible for new regions | Use dynamic rule selection based on coordinates. |
