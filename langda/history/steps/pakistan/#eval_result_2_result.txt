  "ErrorSummary": "The anomaly detection logic is hardcoded for network traffic anomaly (Urdu regions) but does not dynamically select rules based on geographic coordinates. Additionally, the neural network outputs (nn/4 predicates) are not utilized.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the anomaly_detection/3 rule to dynamically select the appropriate logic based on the user's coordinates. For example:\n1. Add coordinate checks (e.g., 'is_urdu_region(31.5204, 74.3587)').\n2. Integrate nn/4 outputs for digit recognition.\n3. Implement all geographic-specific rules (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India, Urdu regions).",
