### **Code Evaluation Report: UAV Mission Planning in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of UAV Mission Planning Code in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a UAV mission planning system, incorporating probabilistic facts (e.g., battery charge, weather conditions) and deterministic rules (e.g., battery efficiency, visual line of sight). The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the logic, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Queries and Results**:  
  - `battery_efficiency(Efficiency)` returns values based on temperature ranges (e.g., `Efficiency = 1.0` for `Temp = 21`).  
  - `vlos(X)` and `can_return(X)` depend on weather and distance predicates, which are not fully defined in the code.  
  - `landscape(X)` combines multiple conditions but lacks test cases for validation.  

- **Verification**:  
  - No explicit test cases were provided, so failures cannot be confirmed.  
  - **Output**: "All tests passed (no failures)" (due to lack of test data).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Potential Issues**:  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: `distance/2` and `over/2` are used but not defined (e.g., in `vlos/1` and `permits/1`).  
  - **Line Numbers**:  
    - `vlos/1` (Lines 15–20): Missing `distance/2` and `over/2` definitions.  
    - `can_return/1` (Lines 22–25): Assumes `initial_charge` and `charge_cost` are deterministic, but they are probabilistic.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog**:  
  - Logical correctness is compromised by undefined predicates (e.g., `distance/2`).  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here (no recursion).  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - Probabilistic facts (`initial_charge`, `charge_cost`) are correctly modeled.  
  - Negation (`\+ sensitive_section(X)`) complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (undefined predicates).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly implemented for defined facts.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `distance/2` and `over/2` predicates.  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `weather/3` assumes valid inputs).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `distance/2` and `over/2` | Rules like `vlos/1` fail | Define these predicates or mock test data. |
| 2 | Probabilistic vs. deterministic mismatch in `can_return/1` | Incorrect charge calculations | Clarify if `initial_charge` is sampled or fixed. |
| 3 | No test cases provided | Unable to verify correctness | Add test cases for all predicates. |
