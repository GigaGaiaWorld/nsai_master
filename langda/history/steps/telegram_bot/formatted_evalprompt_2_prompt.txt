<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: UAV Mission Planning in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of UAV Mission Planning Code in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a UAV mission planning system, incorporating probabilistic facts (e.g., battery charge, weather conditions) and deterministic rules (e.g., battery efficiency, visual line of sight). The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the logic, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Queries and Results**:  
  - `battery_efficiency(Efficiency)` returns values based on temperature ranges (e.g., `Efficiency = 1.0` for `Temp = 21`).  
  - `vlos(X)` and `can_return(X)` depend on weather and distance predicates, which are not fully defined in the code.  
  - `landscape(X)` combines multiple conditions but lacks test cases for validation.  

- **Verification**:  
  - No explicit test cases were provided, so failures cannot be confirmed.  
  - **Output**: "All tests passed (no failures)" (due to lack of test data).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Potential Issues**:  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: `distance/2` and `over/2` are used but not defined (e.g., in `vlos/1` and `permits/1`).  
  - **Line Numbers**:  
    - `vlos/1` (Lines 15–20): Missing `distance/2` and `over/2` definitions.  
    - `can_return/1` (Lines 22–25): Assumes `initial_charge` and `charge_cost` are deterministic, but they are probabilistic.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog**:  
  - Logical correctness is compromised by undefined predicates (e.g., `distance/2`).  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here (no recursion).  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - Probabilistic facts (`initial_charge`, `charge_cost`) are correctly modeled.  
  - Negation (`\+ sensitive_section(X)`) complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (undefined predicates).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly implemented for defined facts.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `distance/2` and `over/2` predicates.  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `weather/3` assumes valid inputs).  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `distance/2` and `over/2` | Rules like `vlos/1` fail | Define these predicates or mock test data. |
| 2 | Probabilistic vs. deterministic mismatch in `can_return/1` | Incorrect charge calculations | Clarify if `initial_charge` is sampled or fixed. |
| 3 | No test cases provided | Unable to verify correctness | Add test cases for all predicates. |

**Format**: Markdown with tables and code blocks.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
