### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss experiment where a counter `CNT` decrements from a starting value (e.g., 4) to 0. For each step, if the coin lands heads (with a probability of 0.8), the success count `SC` increments by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Expected Result:** A probabilistic distribution over possible values of `S` (e.g., `S = 0`, `S = 1`, ..., `S = 4`).  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 7, Column 12: The `->/2` operator is not recognized in ProbLog.  
  - **Affected Predicate:** `coins_r/3` (specifically, the conditional logic `(coin(CNT) -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC = SC)`).  

- **Root Cause:**  
  - ProbLog does not support the Prolog-style `->/2` operator for conditional branching. Instead, probabilistic implications or auxiliary predicates should be used.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic (`coins_r/3`) is sound, but the conditional branching is incorrectly implemented for ProbLog.  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT` reaches 0.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The code does not violate probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`), but the conditional logic is not compatible with ProbLog's syntax.  

- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but conditional branching fails).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the `->/2` error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `->/2` operator in ProbLog.  
  - Non-list input: Not applicable here.  
  - Deep recursive performance: No issues observed.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator        | Conditional logic fails         | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`).    |
| 2   | Probabilistic branching missing  | Incorrect probability results   | Use probabilistic facts or auxiliary predicates to model the coin toss.   |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code fails due to the use of Prolog's `->/2` operator, which is unsupported in ProbLog. To fix this, replace the conditional logic with ProbLog-compatible constructs. The recursive logic and termination are correct, but the probabilistic reasoning must be reimplemented. No DeepProbLog features are used.
