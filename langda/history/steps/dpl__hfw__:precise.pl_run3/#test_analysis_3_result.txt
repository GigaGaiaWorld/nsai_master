### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse a list of symbols representing numbers and arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and compute the result of the expression. The code includes predicates for detecting numbers and operators, parsing the list, and evaluating the expression with an `almost_equal` check for floating-point precision. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze potential failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:
  - The query returns a result of `0.0000`, which is incorrect for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`. The expected result should be approximately `-13.6667`.
  - **Conclusion**: The test fails.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The query for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` returns `0.0000` instead of the expected `-13.6667`.
- **Error Location**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It only handles the base case of a single number (`parse([N], R)`). The recursive cases for arithmetic operations (e.g., `[N1, + | T]`) are missing.
  - **Code Line**: The issue lies in the missing rules for `parse/2` (lines where `parse/2` should be expanded).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate lacks rules to handle arithmetic operations recursively. The current implementation only checks for single numbers, leading to incorrect results for compound expressions.
  - The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly defined but unused in the missing `parse/2` rules.
- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is tested.
- **DeepProbLog**:
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code correctly detects numbers and operators but fails to parse and evaluate compound expressions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs or malformed expressions are not handled.
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the lack of recursive parsing rules.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `parse/2` rules for operations | Incorrect expression evaluation | Add recursive `parse/2` rules for each operator (e.g., `[N1, + | T]`). |
| 2      | No probabilistic reasoning       | Limited functionality          | Extend with probabilistic facts/rules if needed.                           |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features          | N/A                            | Report as "DeepProbLog feature not used."                                  |

#### **8. Corrective Actions**
1. **Add Missing `parse/2` Rules**:
   ```prolog
   parse([N1, + | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
   parse([N1, - | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(N1 - R2, R).
   parse([N1, * | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(N1 * R2, R).
   parse([N1, / | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(N1 / R2, R).
   ```
2. **Test the Updated Code**:
   - Verify that the query now returns the correct result (`-13.6667`).

---

#### **9. Final Remarks**
The code requires expansion of the `parse/2` predicate to handle arithmetic operations recursively. Once updated, it should pass all tests for classical reasoning. No issues were found in probabilistic or DeepProbLog contexts, as they were not utilized. Edge cases (e.g., malformed inputs) should be addressed in future iterations.
