### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of symbols (numbers and operators). The goal is to ensure the code correctly handles arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and evaluates expressions accurately, even with floating-point precision. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and adherence to probabilistic rules (if applicable).

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The expected result for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` is `-13.666...`. The actual result (`11.666...`) is incorrect.  
  **Conclusion**: The test failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returned an incorrect result.  
- **Problematic Predicate**:  
  The `parse/2` rules do not account for operator precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction). The current implementation evaluates operations left-to-right without parentheses or precedence rules.  
- **Code Line**:  
  The issue lies in the `parse/2` predicates (lines defining arithmetic operations).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The code fails to implement operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation of nested expressions. For example, `3 + 3` should be evaluated before `2 / (3 + 3)`, but the code processes operations sequentially.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `parse/2` terminates correctly for valid inputs, but the logic is flawed for complex expressions.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code evaluates simple expressions but fails for nested or precedence-sensitive expressions.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for very long expressions.  
  - Undefined cases (e.g., division by zero) are not addressed.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong evaluation of expressions | Implement precedence rules or use parentheses parsing. |
| 2      | No handling of edge cases        | Potential runtime errors       | Add checks for division by zero and invalid inputs. |
| 3      | No probabilistic features        | Limited scope                  | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires revision to handle operator precedence and edge cases. The current implementation is unsuitable for complex arithmetic expressions.
