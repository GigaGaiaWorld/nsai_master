{"HASH": "20226698","ErrorSummary": "The anomaly detection logic does not account for the geographic coordinate (16.5062° N, 80.6480° E) which corresponds to India. The current logic checks for sum > 120, which is correct for India, but the variable names (Current1, Current2) should be explicitly documented to match the requirement for power overload anomaly detection.","SuggestedFix": "Add a comment to clarify that the variables represent branch currents (e.g., % For India: Current1 and Current2 are branch currents in Amperes). No code changes needed as the logic is correct.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
