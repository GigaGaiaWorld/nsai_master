### ProbLog Merge Sort Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The code is tested for classical reasoning (recursive termination, logical correctness) and probabilistic reasoning (if applicable). The evaluation also checks for edge cases and adherence to functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The following predicates were verified:  
1. `merge_sort/2`: Correctly implements recursive splitting and merging.  
2. `split_list/3`: Splits the list into two halves.  
3. `merge/3`: Merges two sorted lists into one.  

All predicates adhere to their respective requirements as outlined in the code blocks with hashes `B56DC140` and `C59ECA2A`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The merge sort logic is correctly implemented. The recursive calls terminate when the list length is ≤ 1.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) ensure termination.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The result is deterministic (probability 1.0000).  

- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **Not Used**: The code does not involve neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) or probabilistic fusion.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements merge sort.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Empty List**: Handled by the first rule (`merge_sort([], []).`).  
  - **Single-Element List**: Handled by the second rule (`merge_sort([X], [X]).`).  
  - **Non-List Input**: Not explicitly handled; may cause errors if input is not a list.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion could be inefficient for very large lists, but this is inherent to the algorithm.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Low    | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Medium | Consider iterative optimizations.   |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The merge sort implementation is correct and passes the provided test case. No failures were detected, but edge cases like non-list input could be addressed for robustness.
