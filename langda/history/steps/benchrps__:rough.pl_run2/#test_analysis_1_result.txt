### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a function to determine the winner of a series of moves between two players. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because they have two wins (`paper` beats `rock` twice) and one loss (`scissor` loses to `rock`). The score calculation is accurate, and the output matches expectations.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the test case validates the functionality as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The rules for `beats/2` and `play_round/3` are logically correct and cover all possible outcomes (win, lose, draw). The recursive predicate `play/3` correctly processes lists of moves and terminates when the input lists are empty.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination, and the recursive case processes the lists incrementally.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P::fact` or probabilistic implications). Thus, no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  The code does not use neural network integration (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game rules and determines the winner based on classical logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input moves are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Empty Lists**: Handled correctly by the base case of `play/3`.  
- **Performance**: The recursive implementation is efficient for typical game lengths but could face stack issues with very deep recursion (unlikely in this context).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. No issues were identified during testing. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic features or neural network integration if needed.
