  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in core stack operations. Edge cases (non-list inputs, deep recursion in sorting) could be addressed for robustness.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Optional enhancements: (1) Add input validation for stack operations to handle non-list inputs. (2) Optimize insertion_sort/2 for large lists (e.g., iterative approach). (3) Extend sort operation to handle more than top 3 elements.",
