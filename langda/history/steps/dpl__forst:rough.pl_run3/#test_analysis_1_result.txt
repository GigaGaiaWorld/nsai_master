### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a series of stack operations, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 1, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected behavior for each stack operation.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are logically correct. For example, `push` correctly prepends an element to the stack, and `pop` removes the top element.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `insertion_sort` predicate terminates correctly because the base case (`insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc)`) is reached after all elements are processed.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All stack operations behave as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The `insertion_sort` predicate may face performance issues with large lists due to its recursive nature.  
- **Undefined Cases:** The `sort` operation assumes the stack has at least 3 elements. For smaller stacks, the `get_top_n` predicate may fail.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input for stack | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | `sort` requires ≥3 elements | Partial failure | Handle smaller stacks gracefully. |
| 3 | Recursive performance | Slow for large lists | Optimize or use iterative sorting. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Remarks:** The code is functionally correct for the tested cases. However, edge cases and performance optimizations should be addressed for robustness.
