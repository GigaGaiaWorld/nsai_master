  "HASH": "5E40E418",
  "ErrorSummary": "1. Non-list input for stack causes runtime errors. 2. `sort` operation fails for stacks with fewer than 3 elements. 3. Recursive `insertion_sort` may be inefficient for large lists.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for stack operations (e.g., `is_list(Stack)`). 2. Modify `get_top_n` to handle stacks with fewer than N elements (e.g., return remaining elements as-is). 3. Consider replacing `insertion_sort` with a more efficient sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort) or make it iterative.",
