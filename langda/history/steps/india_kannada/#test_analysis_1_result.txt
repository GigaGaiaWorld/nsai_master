### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Anomaly Detection Logic for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code defines neural networks for digit recognition in multiple languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) and implements anomaly detection logic based on geographic coordinates. The user's current location is (12.2958° N, 76.6394° E), which corresponds to Mysuru, India. The anomaly detection logic must align with the geographic requirements for India (power overload anomaly). This report evaluates the correctness of the implementation, test results, and adherence to ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the anomaly detection logic are as follows:
- `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1],[img_1, img_5],1) = 0.0000`  
  **Expected**: 0 (no anomaly). **Actual**: 0. **Passed**.
- `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000`  
  **Expected**: 0 (no anomaly). **Actual**: 0. **Passed**.
- `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5],[img_5, img_9],1) = 1.0000`  
  **Expected**: 1 (anomaly detected). **Actual**: 1. **Passed**.

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The anomaly detection logic correctly identifies anomalies based on the sum of branch currents exceeding 150A, as required for India.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:
- `number/3` and `number/2`: Correctly convert digit lists to numbers using the `kannada_digit` predicate (as per the user's location).
- `anomaly_detection/3`: Implements the power overload logic for India.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The recursive `number/3` predicate terminates correctly for empty lists and non-empty lists. The `anomaly_detection/3` rule adheres to the geographic requirement for India (sum of branch currents > 150A).
- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). All predicates are deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  The `nn/4` predicates define neural networks for digit recognition, but their outputs are not explicitly used in the anomaly detection logic. **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The logic correctly converts digits and detects anomalies.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not used.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Defined but not utilized in the anomaly detection logic.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs to `number/3` or `anomaly_detection/3` are not handled.
  - Deep recursion could impact performance for long digit lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | DeepProbLog not used | Limited integration | Explicitly use neural network outputs in anomaly detection. |
| 2   | Non-list input edge case | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 3   | Geographic logic not modular | Hard-coded for India | Use dynamic rules based on user coordinates. |
