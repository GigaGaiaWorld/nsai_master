### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Anomaly Detection Logic for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for detecting anomalies based on geographic coordinates and local language digit recognition. The system uses neural networks to convert digits from different languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) into numerical values and applies specific anomaly detection logic depending on the user's location. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided are as follows:
- `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1],[img_1, img_5],1) = 0.0000`
- `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000`
- `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5],[img_5, img_9],1) = 1.0000`

**Verification:**
- The user's coordinates (12.2958° N, 76.6394° E) correspond to India, where the anomaly detection logic checks if the sum of branch currents exceeds 150A.
  - For `[img_9, img_1]` and `[img_1, img_5]`, the sum is 91 + 15 = 106 ≤ 150 → No anomaly (correct).
  - For `[img_5, img_1]` and `[img_5, img_1]`, the sum is 51 + 51 = 102 ≤ 150 → No anomaly (correct).
  - For `[img_9, img_5]` and `[img_5, img_9]`, the sum is 95 + 59 = 154 > 150 → Anomaly detected (correct).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned the expected values based on the geographic-specific anomaly detection logic.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `number/3` predicate correctly converts digit lists into numerical values using recursive accumulation.
  - The `anomaly_detection/3` predicate adheres to the geographic-specific rules, as verified by the test cases.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**
  - The code does not explicitly use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Integration:**
  - The `nn/4` predicates define neural networks for digit recognition, but the test cases do not involve probabilistic reasoning over neural network outputs. Thus, the fusion of neural networks and probabilistic reasoning is not tested here. **DeepProbLog feature not used in testing.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly implements geographic-specific anomaly detection.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not tested in the provided scenarios.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Defined but not tested for probabilistic fusion.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit lists. Non-list inputs or unrecognized digits would cause errors.
  - **Recursive Performance:** The `number/3` predicate is tail-recursive, ensuring efficient execution for long lists.
  - **Language-Specific Digits:** The neural networks are defined for specific languages, but the test cases only use `kannada_digit`.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | DeepProbLog not tested | Limited validation of neural-probabilistic fusion | Include test cases with probabilistic facts and neural outputs. |
| 2   | Edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs) | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation or error-handling predicates. |

**Final Note:** The code meets the requirements for classical reasoning and geographic-specific anomaly detection. Further testing is recommended for DeepProbLog features and edge cases.
