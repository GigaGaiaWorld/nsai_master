### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Anomaly Detection Logic for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for detecting anomalies based on geographic coordinates. The system uses neural networks to classify digits in different languages (Arabic, Telugu, Urdu) and applies region-specific anomaly detection logic. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1) = 0.0000`  
- `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1) = 0.0000`  
- `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior for the Telugu region (India), where the anomaly is triggered when the sum of branch currents exceeds 150A.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The anomaly detection logic correctly implements the region-specific rules for Telugu (India).

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive predicate `number/3` correctly converts digit lists to numbers.  
- The anomaly detection logic (`anomaly_detection/3`) adheres to the geographic-specific requirements for Telugu regions (sum of branch currents > 150A).  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The neural network outputs (`nn/4`) are integrated deterministically, as the probabilities are not explicitly used in the anomaly detection logic.  
- The negation in `anomaly_detection/3` (line `\+ anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, 1)`) complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The `nn/4` predicates are used to classify digits, but the neural network outputs are not fused with probabilistic reasoning.  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not fully utilized (no probabilistic fusion)."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met (correct digit-to-number conversion and anomaly detection).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met (no explicit probabilistic fusion with neural outputs).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Met (digit classification works deterministically).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Non-list inputs to `number/3` are not handled (e.g., `number(atom, Y)` would fail).  
- Deep recursion in `number/3` could cause performance issues for long digit lists.
