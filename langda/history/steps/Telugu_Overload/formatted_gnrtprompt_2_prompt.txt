System: You are a coding assistant. You could use the available tools to complete the task, you should always use 'get_report_tool' first to gain more information.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog.  Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_format>

1. Arab: If the temperature in the engine cooling circuit is too high and the coolant flow is too low, there is a serious risk of overheating.
Anomaly: Temperature ≥ 80 ℃ and Flow rate ≤ 20 L/min. Digit1 is Temperature, Digit2 is Flow, they are numbers of each corresponding parameter.
2. India: In a power distribution cabinet, if the sum of the currents of two branches exceeds 150A, the overload protection may be triggered.
Digit1 and Digit2 are values of each branch.
3. Pakistan: In network security monitoring, we usually regard packets in network traffic where "source IP (X) equals destination IP (Y)" as abnormal
Digit1 and Digit2 are values of each current.

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
3. Your could take the advise in <Analysis>
</Regenerate_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed code here
```

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
