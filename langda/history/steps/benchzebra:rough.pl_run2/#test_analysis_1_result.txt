### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, satisfying all given constraints.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly checks adjacency using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly checks if one element is immediately to the right of another in a list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The code adheres to the constraints of the Zebra Puzzle, ensuring all attributes (color, nationality, drink, etc.) are correctly assigned.  
  - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly for valid inputs.  

- **Probabilistic Soundness:**  
  - The solution is deterministic (probability = 1.0000), indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved.  
  - No violations of probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are present, as the problem is purely logical.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using pure logical constraints.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes valid list inputs; no handling for invalid inputs.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to ProbLog's syntax and semantics. No issues were identified during testing. The solution is purely logical and does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Edge cases are minimal due to the fixed nature of the puzzle.
