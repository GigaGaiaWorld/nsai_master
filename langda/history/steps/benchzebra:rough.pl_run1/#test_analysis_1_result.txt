### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle. All constraints are satisfied, and the probability of the solution is 1.0000, indicating certainty.  
- **Conclusion:** **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly checks adjacency using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly checks if one element is immediately to the right of another in a list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The code adheres to the constraints of the Zebra Puzzle. Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly.  
  - No undefined predicates or infinite recursion risks are present.  

- **Probabilistic Soundness:**  
  - The solution is deterministic (probability = 1.0000), so no probabilistic facts or negations are involved.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using classical logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Input Validation:** The code assumes valid input (a list of 5 houses). Non-list input or incorrect length would fail.  
  - **Performance:** Recursive predicates are efficient for small lists but may face performance issues with very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to ProbLog's syntax and semantics. No failures or edge-case issues were detected. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation or exploring probabilistic extensions to the puzzle.
