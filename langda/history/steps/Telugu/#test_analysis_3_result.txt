### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Anomaly Detection

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Anomaly Detection in Power Distribution Cabinets**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect anomalies in a power distribution cabinet by evaluating whether the sum of currents from two branches exceeds a threshold of 150A. The code uses a neural network (`mnist_net`) to recognize digits from images and converts them into numerical values for comparison. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following test cases were executed:

1. **Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 0)`  
   **Result**: `1.0000`  
   **Expected**: `0` (since `51 + 15 = 66 ≤ 150`)  
   **Status**: **Failed**

2. **Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_7, img_9], 1)`  
   **Result**: `1.0000`  
   **Expected**: `1` (since `95 + 79 = 174 > 150`)  
   **Status**: **Passed**

**Summary**: One test passed, and one test failed.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 0)`  
  - **Issue**: The result was `1.0000` (anomaly detected), but the expected result was `0` (no anomaly).  
  - **Affected Predicate**: `anomaly_detection/3` (lines 5–8).  
  - **Root Cause**: The `number/2` predicate incorrectly concatenates digits. For `[img_5, img_1]`, it should yield `51`, but the current implementation may not handle digit concatenation correctly.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Analysis**:
  - The `number/2` predicate recursively processes digits but may not correctly accumulate the result for multi-digit numbers. For example, `[img_5, img_1]` should be interpreted as `51`, not `5 + 1 = 6`.
  - **Recursive Termination**: The recursion in `number/3` terminates correctly, but the accumulation logic is flawed.

- **ProbLog Analysis**:
  - The probabilistic facts (`nn(mnist_net,...)`) are correctly defined, and the neural network integration is functional.
  - No probabilistic implications or negations are used, so no further analysis is required here.

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  The `nn/3` predicate is used to integrate neural network outputs, confirming that DeepProbLog features are correctly utilized.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic for digit concatenation is incorrect.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic rules beyond `nn/3`).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Correctly implemented via `nn/3`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Digit1` and `Digit2` are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is manageable for small lists but could be inefficient for large inputs.
  - **Undefined Cases**: The `number/2` predicate does not handle empty lists or invalid inputs gracefully.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect digit concatenation    | False anomaly detection         | Fix `number/2` to correctly concatenate digits. |
| 2   | Non-list input handling missing  | Runtime errors                  | Add input validation for lists.     |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The code requires fixes in the `number/2` predicate to handle digit concatenation correctly. Edge cases and input validation should also be addressed.
