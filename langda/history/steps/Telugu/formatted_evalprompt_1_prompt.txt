<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Anomaly Detection in Power Distribution

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of `anomaly_detection` in ProbLog for Overload Protection**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect anomalies in a power distribution cabinet by summing the currents of two branches (`Digit1` and `Digit2`). If the sum exceeds 150A, the overload protection is triggered (`Result = 1`). The code uses a neural network (`mnist_net`) to translate digits into real numbers and performs classical reasoning to determine the anomaly.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:16.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, Result)` failed due to an undefined predicate or syntax error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `anomaly_detection` predicate, specifically at the line where the `->` operator is used (line 10:16).
- **Root Cause:** The `->` operator is not correctly defined or used in the ProbLog context. ProbLog does not natively support the `->` operator for conditional logic in this form.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:** The recursive predicate `number/3` is logically correct and terminates properly. However, the `anomaly_detection` predicate fails due to incorrect use of conditional logic.
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Integration:** The `nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,...)` predicate is correctly defined, but the neural network output is not fused with probabilistic reasoning. The error is unrelated to DeepProbLog features.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `number/3` predicate works, but the `anomaly_detection` predicate fails.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Correctly defined but not utilized due to the failure in `anomaly_detection`.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs to `number/3` are not handled.
  - The `->` operator is not supported in ProbLog for conditional logic.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `->` operator in ProbLog | `anomaly_detection` fails       | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if-then-else`). |
| 2      | Non-list input handling missing   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for `number/3`.                                        |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code fails due to the unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog. To fix this, replace the conditional logic with a ProbLog-compatible alternative (e.g., using `if-then-else` or auxiliary predicates). Additionally, handle edge cases like non-list inputs to ensure robustness. The DeepProbLog feature is correctly defined but not utilized due to the failure in classical reasoning. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
