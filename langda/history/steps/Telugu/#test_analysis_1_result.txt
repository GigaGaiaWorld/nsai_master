### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Anomaly Detection in Power Distribution

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of `anomaly_detection` in ProbLog for Overload Protection**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect anomalies in a power distribution cabinet by summing the currents of two branches (`Digit1` and `Digit2`). If the sum exceeds 150A, the overload protection is triggered (`Result = 1`). The code uses a neural network (`mnist_net`) to translate digits into real numbers and performs classical reasoning to determine the anomaly.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:16.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, Result)` failed due to an undefined predicate or syntax error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `anomaly_detection` predicate, specifically at the line where the `->` operator is used (line 10:16).
- **Root Cause:** The `->` operator is not correctly defined or used in the ProbLog context. ProbLog does not natively support the `->` operator for conditional logic in this form.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:** The recursive predicate `number/3` is logically correct and terminates properly. However, the `anomaly_detection` predicate fails due to incorrect use of conditional logic.
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Integration:** The `nn(mnist_net,[X],Y,...)` predicate is correctly defined, but the neural network output is not fused with probabilistic reasoning. The error is unrelated to DeepProbLog features.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `number/3` predicate works, but the `anomaly_detection` predicate fails.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Correctly defined but not utilized due to the failure in `anomaly_detection`.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs to `number/3` are not handled.
  - The `->` operator is not supported in ProbLog for conditional logic.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `->` operator in ProbLog | `anomaly_detection` fails       | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if-then-else`). |
| 2      | Non-list input handling missing   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for `number/3`.                                        |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code fails due to the unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog. To fix this, replace the conditional logic with a ProbLog-compatible alternative (e.g., using `if-then-else` or auxiliary predicates). Additionally, handle edge cases like non-list inputs to ensure robustness. The DeepProbLog feature is correctly defined but not utilized due to the failure in classical reasoning.
