### **ProbLog Code Evaluation Report**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Recursive Coin Toss Program**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog program models a recursive coin-tossing scenario where each coin has an 80% probability of landing heads. The program counts the number of successful heads (`SC`) over a fixed number of trials (`CNT`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, recursive logic, and adherence to the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the query `total(_)` are as follows:  
- `total(4) = 0.4096`  
- `total(3) = 0.4096`  
- `total(2) = 0.1536`  
- `total(1) = 0.0256`  
- `total(0) = 0.0016`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities sum to 1 (`0.4096 + 0.4096 + 0.1536 + 0.0256 + 0.0016 = 1.0`), confirming correctness.  
- The results align with the binomial distribution for `P(heads) = 0.8` and `n = 4` trials.  

**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The results match the expected probabilities for the given scenario.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly implements the logic:  
- Decrements `CNT` until it reaches 0.  
- Updates `SC` based on the outcome of `coin(CNT)`.  
- Accumulates results in `S`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursion terminates when `CNT = 0`, and the base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)` ensures proper accumulation.  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8)` correctly models an 80% chance of success.  

**Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**  
- Negation (`\+ coin(CNT)`) adheres to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- The disjunction (`;`) in the recursive step correctly combines probabilistic outcomes.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **DeepProbLog feature not used.** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements Met:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** The recursive logic is sound.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The program correctly computes probabilities for binomial outcomes.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** None detected.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable (input is numeric).  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is fixed (`CNT = 4`), so performance is not an issue.
