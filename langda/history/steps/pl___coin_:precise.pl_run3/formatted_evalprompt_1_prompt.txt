           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, where each coin has a probability of 0.8 to land heads. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) over a decreasing counter (`CNT`) and accumulate the results in `S`. The code is tested with a query `total(S)`, which initializes the counter to 4.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the code's logic and probabilistic reasoning.  
- Identify and analyze any failures in the test results.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and probabilistic rules.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
```  
- **Failed Query**: `total(S)`  
- **Expected Result**: A probabilistic distribution of `S` (e.g., `S=0: 0.0016, S=1: 0.0256, ..., S=4: 0.4096`).  
- **Actual Result**: Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**: Line 7, Column 12.  
- **Problematic Code Block**:  
  ```problog
  (coin(CNT) -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC = SC),
  ```  
- **Issue**: The `->/2` operator is not correctly defined or recognized in the ProbLog context. ProbLog does not natively support the Prolog-style `->/2` (if-then-else) operator without proper definitions or libraries.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive logic (`coins_r/3`) is sound, but the use of `->/2` is incorrect.  
  - ProbLog requires explicit handling of probabilistic conditions, such as using `if/3` or defining probabilistic implications.  

- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The code does not comply with ProbLog's probabilistic rules for implications (`P(A⇒B)`).  
  - The negation and implication rules (`P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`) are not explicitly handled.  

- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the `->/2` operator is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (probabilistic implications are not correctly implemented).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `->/2` operator.  
  - Non-termination risk if `CNT` is negative (not guarded in the code).  
  - Performance impact for deep recursion (not observed here due to small `CNT`).  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator       | Code fails to execute           | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible constructs (e.g., `if/3` or `prob/2`). |
| 2   | Probabilistic rules not applied  | Incorrect probability results   | Explicitly define probabilistic implications and negations.                 |
| 3   | No guard for negative `CNT`      | Potential non-termination       | Add a guard `CNT >= 0` in the recursive rule.                              |

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires corrections to the `->/2` operator and explicit handling of probabilistic rules to meet the functional requirements. Edge cases like negative `CNT` should also be addressed.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
