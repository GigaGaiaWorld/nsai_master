#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, ensuring that the probabilistic reasoning aligns with the expected outcomes (e.g., the probability of winning by switching doors should be ~2/3). The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` (probability of winning by keeping the initial choice) is ~1/3, which is correct.  
- `win_switch` (probability of winning by switching doors) is ~2/3, which is correct.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Uniform Random Selection:** When two doors are available, Monty selects one uniformly at random.  
2. **Forced Selection:** When only one door is available, Monty must open it.  

The predicates `open_door/1`, `win_keep`, and `win_switch` are correctly defined and behave as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` correctly handle the two cases (uniform selection and forced selection).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly implemented and terminates for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly defined (1/3 for each door).  
- The negation `\+ prize(D)` and implications (e.g., `\+ (D = Selected)`) comply with probabilistic rules.  
- The probabilistic fact `0.5::open_door(D)` correctly models uniform selection between two doors.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic for door selection and prize distribution is correct.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with the Monty Hall problem's theoretical outcomes.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The input to `member/2` is always a finite list (`[1,2,3]`), so non-list inputs are not a concern.  
- Recursion depth is minimal and does not impact performance.  
- No undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are present.

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | No failures detected | N/A    | N/A        |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning aligns with the expected outcomes of the Monty Hall problem. No issues or edge cases were overlooked.
