  "ErrorSummary": "Non-ground probabilistic clause (`coin(C)`) causing query execution failure. The variable `C` in `coin(C)` is not instantiated, violating ProbLog's grounding requirements.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Ground the probabilistic fact by either (1) defining specific coins (e.g., `coin(c1). coin(c2).`) or (2) modifying `coin(C)` to use a list of coins (e.g., `coin(C) :- member(C, [c1, c2, c3]), make_coin(C, 0.8).`). Additionally, add input validation for `CNT` (e.g., `CNT >= 0`).",
