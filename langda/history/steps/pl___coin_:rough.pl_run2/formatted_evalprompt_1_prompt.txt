    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads after all tosses. The code uses recursion and probabilistic facts to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a **non-ground probabilistic clause**. The error occurs at line 1:5, where the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not properly grounded. No queries were successfully executed due to this error.

**Failed Queries:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Error:** `NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.`  
  - **Expected:** The query should return a probability distribution over possible values of `S` (total heads).  
  - **Actual:** The query fails to execute due to the non-ground clause.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate/Rule:**  
  - `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).`  
  - **Location:** Line 1:5  
  - **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not grounded, as `C` is a free variable. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be grounded (i.e., `C` must be instantiated).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical reasoning, but the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not grounded, violating ProbLog's rules.  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT` reaches 0.

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The error arises because `coin(C)` is not grounded, which is required for probabilistic facts. ProbLog cannot compute probabilities for non-ground clauses.  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the probabilistic fact is not grounded).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground clause.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle cases where `CNT` is negative or non-integer.  
  - The probabilistic fact `coin(C)` must be grounded to avoid runtime errors.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1       | Non-ground probabilistic clause (`coin(C)`) | Query execution fails | Ground `C` (e.g., `coin(c1). coin(c2).`) or use a list of coins. |
| 2       | No handling for invalid `CNT` values | Potential runtime errors | Add guards (e.g., `CNT >= 0`) or input validation. |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Tone:** Formal and analytical  

**Conclusion:** The code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic clause. Fixing this issue and addressing edge cases will ensure compliance with ProbLog's requirements and functional correctness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
