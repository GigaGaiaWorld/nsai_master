System: You are a coding assistant. You could use the available tools to complete the task, you should always use 'get_report_tool' first to gain more information.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DF1FDC54 </HASH>
<Requirements>Sample CNT independent coins and accumulate the number of heads facing up SC, and finally get the total number of heads after tossing CNT coins S </Requirements></Langda>
.
total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).

</Code>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here
```

AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: DF1FDC54 </HASH>
<Requirements>Sample CNT independent coins and accumulate the number of heads facing up SC, and finally get the total number of heads after tossing CNT coins S </Requirements></Langda>
.
total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

PH::make_coin(C, PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).

coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(C),
    (C -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC is SC),
    NCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC, S, NCNT).

total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).

<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
