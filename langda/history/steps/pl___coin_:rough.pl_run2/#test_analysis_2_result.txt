### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin `CNT` times and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`) to compute the total number of heads (`S`). The code uses recursion and probabilistic facts to model the coin toss. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any failures or edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = self.handle_nonground(
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Expected Result:** A probabilistic distribution of the total number of heads after 4 coin tosses.  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to a non-ground probabilistic clause.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - The error occurs in the line `PH::make_coin(C,PH).` (Line 1).  
  - The issue is that the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground because `C` is not instantiated.  

- **Affected Predicates:**  
  - `make_coin/2` (Line 1)  
  - `coin/1` (Line 2)  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical reasoning. It terminates when `CNT` reaches 0.  
  - However, the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground, violating ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).  

- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**  
  - The error indicates a violation of ProbLog's probabilistic rules. Probabilistic facts must be ground to compute probabilities correctly.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the probabilistic fact is non-ground).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic clause.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-ground probabilistic facts are not handled.  
  - The code does not validate input for `CNT` (e.g., negative values).

|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | Prevents probabilistic reasoning | Instantiate `C` in `make_coin(C,PH)` or define it as a ground fact (e.g., `make_coin(c1,0.8)`). |
| 2      | No input validation for `CNT`    | Potential runtime errors        | Add a check to ensure `CNT` is a non-negative integer.                     |

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic clause. Fixing this issue and adding input validation will ensure the code meets its functional requirements. No DeepProbLog features are used.
