### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of the `append/3` predicate, which is required for the `next_to/3` and `right_of/3` predicates. The error message is as follows:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'append/3' at 30:25.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(zebra(Houses))`  
  - **Expected Result:** A valid solution to the Zebra Puzzle.  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to missing `append/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failure occurs in the following predicates:  
1. **`next_to/3`** (Lines 30–31):  
   - The predicate relies on `append/3`, which is not defined in the provided code.  
2. **`right_of/3`** (Lines 34–35):  
   - Similarly, this predicate also depends on `append/3`.

**Code Blocks with Errors:**  
```prolog
next_to(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [X,Y|_], List).
next_to(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [Y,X|_], List).

right_of(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [Y,X|_], List).
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The logical correctness of the puzzle constraints is sound, but the implementation fails due to the missing `append/3` predicate.  
  - Recursive termination is not an issue here, as the predicates are non-recursive.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (fails due to missing `append/3`).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code assumes valid input lists for `next_to/3` and `right_of/3`. Non-list inputs would cause runtime errors.  
  - The absence of `append/3` is a critical oversight.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `append/3` predicate | Prevents execution of `next_to/3` and `right_of/3` | Define `append/3` or use a built-in/library version. |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features     | Limited to classical reasoning  | N/A (if not required).              |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is logically sound but fails due to the missing `append/3` predicate. Once this issue is resolved, the code should execute correctly. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the evaluation is limited to classical reasoning.
