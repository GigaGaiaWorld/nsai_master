### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure during execution. The error message is as follows:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'append/3' at 33:5.
```

- **Failed Query**: `query(zebra(Houses))`.
- **Expected Result**: A valid solution to the Zebra Puzzle.
- **Actual Result**: Error due to missing `append/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate**: The error occurs because the `append/3` predicate is not defined in the provided code. This predicate is required by the `next_to/3` and `right_of/3` predicates.
- **Code Line**: The error is traced to the line where `append/3` is called (line 33:5).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:
  - The logical correctness of the puzzle constraints is sound, but the implementation fails due to the missing `append/3` predicate.
  - Recursive termination is not an issue here, as the predicates `my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3` are correctly defined and terminate properly.
  
- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario**:
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.
  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The puzzle constraints are correctly defined, but the missing `append/3` predicate prevents successful execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic facts.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The missing `append/3` predicate is a critical oversight.
  - Input validation (e.g., non-list input) is not addressed but is not relevant here as the input is hardcoded.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `append/3` predicate     | Execution fails                 | Define `append/3` or include the `lists` library. |
| 2      | No probabilistic facts           | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic facts if needed.  |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features          | No neural integration           | Use `nn/3` if neural integration is required. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
To resolve the error, include the `append/3` predicate or import the `lists` library in ProbLog. For example:
```prolog
:- use_module(library(lists)).
```

Alternatively, define `append/3` manually:
```prolog
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L, [H|R]) :- append(T, L, R).
```

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The implementation is logically sound but fails due to a missing predicate. Fixing this will enable successful execution.
