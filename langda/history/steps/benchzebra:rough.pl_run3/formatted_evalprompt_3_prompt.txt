</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of the `append/3` predicate, which is required for the `next_to/3` and `right_of/3` predicates. The error message is as follows:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'append/3' at 30:25.
```

**Failed Query:**
- `query(zebra(Houses))` fails because the `append/3` predicate is not defined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `append/3`
- **Location:** The error occurs in the definitions of `next_to/3` and `right_of/3`, which rely on `append/3` to check adjacency in the list of houses.
- **Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  next_to(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [X,Y|_], List).
  next_to(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [Y,X|_], List).
  right_of(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [Y,X|_], List).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The logical correctness of the puzzle constraints is sound, but the implementation fails due to the missing `append/3` predicate.
  - Recursive termination is not an issue here, as the problem is purely declarative.

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are irrelevant here.
  - The failure is purely syntactic, not probabilistic.

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The puzzle constraints are correctly specified, but the implementation fails due to the missing `append/3` predicate.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes the input is a list of houses, but there is no validation for non-list inputs.
  - The `append/3` predicate is a built-in in many Prolog systems but must be explicitly defined or imported in ProbLog.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `append/3` predicate     | Prevents execution of the query | Define `append/3` or import the required library. |
| 2      | No input validation              | Potential runtime errors        | Add checks for list inputs.                |

---

### **Conclusion**
The Zebra Puzzle implementation is logically correct but fails due to the absence of the `append/3` predicate. Once this issue is resolved, the code should execute successfully. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation. Addressing the missing predicate and adding input validation will ensure robustness. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
