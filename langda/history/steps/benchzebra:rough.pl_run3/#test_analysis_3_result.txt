### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of the `append/3` predicate, which is required for the `next_to/3` and `right_of/3` predicates. The error message is as follows:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'append/3' at 30:25.
```

**Failed Query:**
- `query(zebra(Houses))` fails because the `append/3` predicate is not defined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `append/3`
- **Location:** The error occurs in the definitions of `next_to/3` and `right_of/3`, which rely on `append/3` to check adjacency in the list of houses.
- **Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  next_to(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [X,Y|_], List).
  next_to(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [Y,X|_], List).
  right_of(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [Y,X|_], List).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The logical correctness of the puzzle constraints is sound, but the implementation fails due to the missing `append/3` predicate.
  - Recursive termination is not an issue here, as the problem is purely declarative.

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are irrelevant here.
  - The failure is purely syntactic, not probabilistic.

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The puzzle constraints are correctly specified, but the implementation fails due to the missing `append/3` predicate.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes the input is a list of houses, but there is no validation for non-list inputs.
  - The `append/3` predicate is a built-in in many Prolog systems but must be explicitly defined or imported in ProbLog.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `append/3` predicate     | Prevents execution of the query | Define `append/3` or import the required library. |
| 2      | No input validation              | Potential runtime errors        | Add checks for list inputs.                |

---

### **Conclusion**
The Zebra Puzzle implementation is logically correct but fails due to the absence of the `append/3` predicate. Once this issue is resolved, the code should execute successfully. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation. Addressing the missing predicate and adding input validation will ensure robustness.
