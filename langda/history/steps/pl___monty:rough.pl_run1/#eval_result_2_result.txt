  "ErrorSummary": "Unmatched '(' in the `findall` clause of `open_door/1`, causing parsing failure. The predicate also has logical flaws in its implementation of Monty's behavior.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Rewrite the `open_door/1` predicate as follows:\n\n```prolog\nopen_door(D) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    findall(X, (member(X, [1,2,3]), Doors),\n    findall(Y, (member(Y, Doors), \\+ prize(Y), \\+ Y = Selected), ValidDoors),\n    (   length(ValidDoors, 2) ->\n        member(D, ValidDoors),\n        0.5::open_door(D)\n    ;   length(ValidDoors, 1) ->\n        member(D, ValidDoors)\n    ).\n```\n\nEnsure proper nesting of `findall` calls and correct syntax for probabilistic rules. The predicate should:\n1. Collect all valid doors (no prize, not selected).\n2. Randomly select one if there are two valid doors.\n3. Open the only valid door if there's one.",
