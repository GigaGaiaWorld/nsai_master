### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and evaluate the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails during evaluation with the error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:130.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The error occurs during the evaluation of the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically due to a syntax issue in the conditional logic (`->` operator).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `open_door/1`  
- **Code Location:** Line 6 (interval: 6:1â€“6:130)  
- **Issue:** The conditional logic in the `open_door/1` predicate is incorrectly formatted. The `->` operator is not properly used, leading to a parsing error.  

**Expected vs. Actual:**  
- **Expected:** The predicate should uniformly select a door to open based on the conditions provided.  
- **Actual:** The predicate fails to compile due to incorrect syntax.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The logic for selecting a door to open is sound but syntactically incorrect. The `->` operator must be used within a proper Prolog conditional structure (e.g., `(Condition -> Action ; Else)`).  
  - The current implementation lacks proper grouping and termination for the conditional branches.

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (`1/3::prize(1)`, etc.) are correctly defined.  
  - The negation (`\+`) and implication logic in `win_switch` and `win_keep` are correctly implemented.

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (failed in `open_door/1`).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for prize selection and winning conditions.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-list input).  
  - Recursive termination is not an issue here, but the predicate's logic is incomplete.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `open_door/1`    | Prevents model evaluation       | Rewrite the conditional logic using proper Prolog syntax for `->`.         |
| 2   | Incomplete handling of edge cases | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation for `open_door/1` (e.g., ensure input is a valid door). |

**Final Notes:**  
The implementation is conceptually correct but requires syntactic fixes in the `open_door/1` predicate. Once corrected, the model should accurately reflect the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic outcomes.
