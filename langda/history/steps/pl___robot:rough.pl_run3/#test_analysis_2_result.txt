### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Navigation and Key Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot navigates between locations and attempts to pick up a key. The key may be slippery, and the robot's actions (e.g., `pickup`, `goto`) have probabilistic outcomes. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the probabilistic and classical reasoning.  
- Ensure the functional requirements (e.g., robot navigation, key carrying) are met.  
- Analyze edge cases and potential failures.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4813 |
| `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0900 |
| `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0100 |
| `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.6300 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.3630 |
| `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0070 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilistic outcomes of the modeled scenario.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `slippery/2`) terminate correctly.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles cases where the key is slippery or not, and the robot's actions succeed or fail.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `goto_succeeds/1` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- **Negations:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is correctly applied in predicates like `drops/2` and `carrying/2`.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's navigation and key-carrying behavior.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic outcomes are computed correctly.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable (e.g., `s(s(s(0)))`).  

##### **Performance**  
The code performs efficiently for the given scenario. No performance bottlenecks were identified.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

**Conclusion:** The code is well-structured, logically correct, and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are suggested at this time.
