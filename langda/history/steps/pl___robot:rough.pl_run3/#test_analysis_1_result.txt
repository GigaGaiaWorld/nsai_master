### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Model Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and identify any logical or syntactic errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a parsing error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = action(s, pos)
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 370, in _token_dot
    raise UnexpectedCharacter(s, pos)
problog.parser.UnexpectedCharacter: Unexpected character '.' at 30:82.
```

**Key Observations:**  
- The error occurs due to an unexpected character (`.`) in the code, likely a misplaced or redundant symbol.  
- No query results are available due to the parsing failure.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** Line 30, Column 82.  
- **Suspected Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-    goto_action(T),    goto_succeeds(T),    do(goto(Pos), T).at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-    goto_action(T),    goto_fails(T),    at(robot,Pos,T).
  ```
  - The issue arises from a misplaced `.` or missing whitespace between predicates.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The error is syntactic, not logical. The parser fails due to an unexpected `.` character.  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here as the code fails before execution.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`) are correctly formatted.  
  - No issues with negation (`\+`) or implications.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (syntax error prevents full evaluation).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Syntax error prevents evaluation.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are not present.  
  - Recursive performance cannot be evaluated due to parsing failure.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unexpected `.` at line 30:82     | Parsing failure, no execution   | Fix syntax by removing/replacing `.` or ensuring proper predicate separation. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code contains a critical syntax error that prevents execution. Once the misplaced `.` is resolved, the model can be re-evaluated for logical and probabilistic correctness. No DeepProbLog features are used.
