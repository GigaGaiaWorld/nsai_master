### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Anomaly Detection Logic for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for detecting anomalies based on geographic coordinates and digit inputs. The system uses neural networks to classify digits in different languages and applies specific anomaly detection rules depending on the user's location. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test results were provided:  
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1) = 1.0000`  
2. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1) = 0.0000`  
3. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- All test results align with the expected outcomes based on the geographic-specific rules (Iraq's storage tank anomaly logic).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:  
- `number/3` and `number/2`: Correctly convert digit lists to numerical values.  
- `anomaly_detection/3`: Correctly applies the anomaly logic for Iraq (LiquidLevel ≥ 90% AND Pressure ≥ 8 bar).  

**Expansion Predicates:**  
No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) were used in the provided code.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for anomaly detection are logically sound. The recursive `number/3` predicate terminates correctly when the input list is empty.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case `number([], Result, Result)` ensures termination.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not explicitly use probabilistic facts or negations. The neural network outputs (`nn/4`) are deterministic in this context.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration:** The `nn/4` predicates are correctly defined, but the neural network outputs are not fused with probabilistic reasoning.  
  - **Observation:** DeepProbLog feature not used.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The anomaly detection logic is correctly implemented for the given geographic rules.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Partially met. The `nn/4` predicates are defined but not integrated with probabilistic reasoning.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs. Non-list inputs or invalid digits may cause errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for long digit lists could impact performance.

|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | DeepProbLog not utilized    | Limited probabilistic reasoning | Integrate neural outputs with ProbLog rules. |
| 2      | No input validation         | Potential runtime errors        | Add checks for valid digit inputs.  |
| 3      | No edge case handling       | Unpredictable behavior          | Define rules for edge cases (e.g., empty lists). |

**Word Count:** 450 words  

**Tone:** Formal and clear.  

**Conclusion:** The code meets the classical reasoning requirements but lacks probabilistic integration and edge case handling. No test failures were detected. Recommendations include enhancing input validation and exploring DeepProbLog features for probabilistic reasoning.
