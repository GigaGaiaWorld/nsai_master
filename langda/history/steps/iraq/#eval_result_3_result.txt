  "HASH": "79CDA518",
  "ErrorSummary": "The anomaly detection logic is hardcoded for Iraq's storage tank anomaly (LiquidLevel ≥ 90% AND Pressure ≥ 8 bar) but does not dynamically adapt to the user's geographic coordinates. The current coordinate (33.3152° N, 44.3661° E) corresponds to Iraq, so the logic is correct for this case, but the code lacks flexibility for other regions.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the anomaly_detection rule to dynamically select the appropriate logic based on the user's coordinates. For example:\n1. Add a geographic_region/2 predicate to map coordinates to regions (e.g., geographic_region((33.3152, 44.3661), iraq).\n2. Use conditional rules to apply the correct anomaly logic based on the region.",
