### **Code Evaluation Report: Anomaly Detection in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Anomaly Detection Logic in ProbLog for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for detecting anomalies based on geographic coordinates. The anomaly detection logic varies depending on the user's location (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India, or Urdu regions). The code uses neural networks to classify digits and converts these digits into numerical values for anomaly checks. This report evaluates the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the test results, failure localization, root causes, and overall functionality.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
- `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1) = 1.0000`  
- `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1) = 1.0000`  
- `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- All test cases pass with the expected output (`1` for anomaly detected).  
- **Conclusion:** "All tests passed (no failures)."  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. The anomaly detection logic for Iraq (the user's current location: 33.3152° N, 44.3661° E) is correctly implemented as:  
```prolog
anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, 1) :- 
    number(Digit1, LiquidLevel), number(Digit2, Pressure),
    (LiquidLevel >= 75 ; Pressure >= 15).
```
This matches the requirement for Iraq (storage tank level anomaly).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `number/3` predicate correctly converts digit lists to numerical values.  
  - The anomaly detection rule for Iraq adheres to the specified conditions (`LiquidLevel ≥ 75% OR Pressure ≥ 15 bar`).  

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - The neural network definitions (`nn/4`) are correctly used to classify digits.  
  - **Observation:** "DeepProbLog feature is used for digit classification but not for probabilistic reasoning."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met (correctly implements geographic-specific rules).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Met (digits are classified using `nn/4`).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs. Non-list inputs or invalid digits may cause errors.  
  - **Recursive Performance:** The `number/3` predicate is tail-recursive and efficient.
