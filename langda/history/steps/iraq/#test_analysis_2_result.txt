### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Anomaly Detection Logic for Geographic-Specific Rules**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for detecting anomalies based on geographic coordinates and digit recognition. The system uses neural networks to recognize digits in different languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) and applies specific anomaly detection rules depending on the user's location. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test results were provided:  
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1], [img_1, img_5], 1) = 1.0000`  
2. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1], [img_5, img_1], 1) = 0.0000`  
3. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5], [img_5, img_9], 1) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- All test results align with the expected outcomes based on the geographic-specific rules (Iraq's storage tank anomaly logic).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:  
- `number/3` and `number/2`: Correctly convert digit lists to numerical values.  
- `anomaly_detection/3`: Correctly implements the geographic-specific logic for Iraq (LiquidLevel ≥ 90% AND Pressure ≥ 8 bar).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for digit conversion (`number/3` and `number/2`) are logically sound and terminate correctly.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `number/3` terminates when the input list is empty.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not explicitly use probabilistic facts or negations. The neural network outputs (`nn/4`) are deterministic in this context.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** The `nn/4` predicates integrate neural network outputs into the logic, but no probabilistic fusion is demonstrated.  
  - **Report:** DeepProbLog feature not used beyond deterministic digit recognition.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The digit conversion and anomaly detection logic are correctly implemented.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not utilized. The code lacks probabilistic facts or rules.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Partially met. The `nn/4` predicates are used for digit recognition, but no probabilistic fusion is demonstrated.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs. Non-list inputs or unrecognized digits would cause errors.  
- **Performance:** The recursion in `number/3` is efficient for small lists but may face performance issues with very long lists.

|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic reasoning  | Limits flexibility            | Add probabilistic facts/rules for uncertainty handling. |
| 2      | Edge cases not handled      | Potential runtime errors      | Validate inputs and handle unrecognized digits. |
| 3      | DeepProbLog not fully used  | Missed opportunities          | Explore probabilistic fusion of neural outputs. |

**Word Count:** 450  

**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  

**Final Note:** The code meets the basic requirements for geographic-specific anomaly detection but could benefit from enhancements in probabilistic reasoning and edge-case handling.
