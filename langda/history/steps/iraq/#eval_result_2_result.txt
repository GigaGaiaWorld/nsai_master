  "ErrorSummary": "The anomaly detection rule is hardcoded for Iraq's storage tank logic but lacks geographic condition checks. The current coordinate (33.3152° N, 44.3661° E) corresponds to Iraq, but the rule does not dynamically adapt to other regions.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the anomaly_detection/3 predicate to include geographic condition checks. For example:\n1. Add a predicate to determine the region from coordinates (e.g., region(Coordinates, 'Iraq')).\n2. Use conditional logic to select the appropriate anomaly rule based on the region.\n3. Ensure the digit conversion (number/2) is applied correctly for each region's specific parameters.",
