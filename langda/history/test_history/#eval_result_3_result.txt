  "ErrorSummary": "Neural network misclassification leads to incorrect sum calculations in the operation/3 predicate. The network fails to correctly recognize digits 7, 8, and 3 in some cases.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Retrain the neural network (arabic_net) to improve digit recognition accuracy. 2. Add input validation to ensure arabic_digit/2 outputs are within the expected range (0-9). 3. Consider adding probabilistic checks to verify neural network outputs align with logical rules.",
