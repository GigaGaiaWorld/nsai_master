<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog UAV Mission Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for UAV Mission Planning**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a UAV mission scenario, incorporating probabilistic facts (e.g., weather conditions, battery charge) and logical rules (e.g., visual line of sight, security constraints). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the code against test results.  
- Analyze logical and probabilistic reasoning.  
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements (e.g., staying north of a bomb).  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Queries and Results:**  
1. **Query:** `vlos(X)`  
   - **Result:** Probability depends on `fog`/`clear` and distance constraints.  
   - **Pass/Fail:** Pass (no failures).  

2. **Query:** `can_return(X)`  
   - **Result:** Depends on `initial_charge`, `charge_cost`, and distance.  
   - **Pass/Fail:** Pass (no failures).  

3. **Query:** `sensitive_section(X)`  
   - **Result:** `X` must be north of a bomb (as per `Langda` block).  
   - **Pass/Fail:** Pass (no failures).  

4. **Query:** `landscape(X)`  
   - **Result:** Combines `security(X)`, `weight`, `can_return(X)`, and `permits(X)`.  
   - **Pass/Fail:** Pass (no failures).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Expansion Predicates:**  
  - No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in the code.  
  - **Verification:** Not applicable.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - Rules like `vlos(X)` and `can_return(X)` are logically sound.  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable (no recursive predicates).  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - `initial_charge ~ normal(90, 5)` and `charge_cost ~ normal(-0.1, 0.2)` comply with probabilistic rules.  
  - Negation and implication are not explicitly used.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Met? | Explanation                          |  
|----------------------|------|--------------------------------------|  
| Classical Reasoning  | Yes  | Rules are logically correct.         |  
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Yes | Probabilistic facts are correctly modeled. |  
| Neural Network Integration | No  | Not applicable.                      |  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable (no list operations).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not applicable.

**Final Notes:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. No errors or edge cases were identified. For future enhancements, consider integrating DeepProbLog for neural network-based reasoning.

**End of Report**

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
