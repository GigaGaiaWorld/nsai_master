Based on the requirements, I'll generate the code block that calculates the current position based on previous position, actuator used, target position, and wind effect. Here's the JSON-formatted Problog code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A5C06F43","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),\n \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n use_actuator(Prev,Actuator),\n actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),\n goal(Target),\n wind_effect(Prev,WindEffect),\n Pos is PrevPos + sign(Target-PrevPos)*Strength + WindEffect."}
```

This code calculates the new attempted flap position by:
1. Getting the previous position
2. Checking if goal wasn't reached yet
3. Using the selected actuator's strength
4. Moving toward the target (using sign to determine direction)
5. Adding wind effect to the movement
