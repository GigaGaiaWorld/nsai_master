  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. The only change is in the 'attempted_flap_position' rule, where '\\+ goal(Old)' was replaced with '\\+ goal_reached(Prev)'. This change does not affect the logic or the results, as both conditions ensure that the goal has not been reached before attempting a new position. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
