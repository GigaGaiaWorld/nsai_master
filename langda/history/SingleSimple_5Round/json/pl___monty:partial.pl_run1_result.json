  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem accurately, with the same probability distributions for the prize, select_door, win_keep, and win_switch queries. The generated code simplifies some conditions but maintains the logical integrity and produces identical results. No problems are identified in the generated code."
