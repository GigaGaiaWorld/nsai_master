  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for draw cases. The original code correctly updates the score by maintaining the current score (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes S1 directly without assignment (S is S1 is missing). This could lead to incorrect score calculations in some cases, though it doesn't affect the given test case."
