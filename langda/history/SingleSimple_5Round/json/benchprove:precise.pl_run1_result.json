  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The only differences are minor formatting changes, such as the removal of comments and whitespace, which do not affect the code's behavior. The generated code maintains all the essential components of the original, including the meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, examples, and queries. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
