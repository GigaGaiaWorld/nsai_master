  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, which leads to incorrect handling of operator precedence and associativity. Specifically, it fails to properly parse expressions involving subtraction and division, resulting in a runtime error due to invalid argument types in the 'almost_equal' predicate. The original code correctly handles these operations by transforming subtraction into addition of a negative product and ensuring proper evaluation order for multiplication and division."
