  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it duplicates the definition of 'pick' and 'palindrome' predicates, which is unnecessary and could lead to confusion. Second, the 'bb' predicate in the generated code is missing the 'II is I+1' step, directly using 'pick(I+1,b)' which changes the logic. This alteration causes the different result (1.0000 vs 0.3750). The generated code is not consistent with the original code in both form and result."
