  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it fails to produce the expected results. While the form of the generated code is similar to the original, it lacks the necessary stack operation predicates (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that were present in the original code. This omission causes the queries to return 0.0000 probability for all operations, indicating failure. The generated code only includes the sort operation and its helper predicates, which are not being tested in the provided queries."
