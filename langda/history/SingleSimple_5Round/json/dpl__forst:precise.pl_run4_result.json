  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The main difference is the replacement of 'insertion_sort' with the built-in 'sort' predicate, which is functionally equivalent for the given queries. The generated code is valid and produces the same results as the original code for the provided test cases."
