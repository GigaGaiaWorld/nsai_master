  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code. The main difference is in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where the generated code uses 'goal_reached(Prev)' instead of 'goal(Old)' to check if the goal has been reached. However, since 'goal_reached(Prev)' is defined in terms of 'goal(G)' and 'flap_position(Prev,Old)', this change does not affect the logic or results. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their consistency."
