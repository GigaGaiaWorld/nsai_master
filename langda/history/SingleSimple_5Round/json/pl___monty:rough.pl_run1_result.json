  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but introduces syntax errors and structural changes that make it invalid. Specifically, the '->' operator is incorrectly used, leading to an 'UnknownClause' error during execution. The original code correctly models the problem with proper probabilistic rules and conditions, while the generated code fails to execute due to these errors. The generated code does not meet the requirements and is not consistent with the original code's functionality."
