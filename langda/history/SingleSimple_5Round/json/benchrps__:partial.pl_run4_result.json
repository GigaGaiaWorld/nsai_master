  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for 'draw' cases. The original code correctly updates the score by keeping it unchanged (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes S1 directly without unification (S is S1 is missing). However, this does not affect the final result in this specific query. The running results of both codes are consistent, correctly identifying player2 as the winner."
