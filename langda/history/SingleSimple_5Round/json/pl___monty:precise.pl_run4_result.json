  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes (win_keep and win_switch). However, the generated code introduces an unnecessary variable 'Selected' in the open_door rules, which is not used in the body of the rules. This does not affect the logic or results but is a minor stylistic inconsistency. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected behavior."
