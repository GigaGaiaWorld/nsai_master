  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. However, there are formatting issues and redundant repetitions of the digit and predicate definitions within the query_sum predicate, which do not affect the logic but make the code less clean. The generated code correctly implements the cryptoaddition problem and maintains the same constraints as the original. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same solutions for the query_sum predicate."
