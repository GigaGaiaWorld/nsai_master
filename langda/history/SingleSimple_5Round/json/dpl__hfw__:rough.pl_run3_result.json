  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect compared to the original code. It lacks several essential parsing rules for handling subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, which are present in the original code. Specifically, the generated code only includes a rule for addition (`parse([N, '+', M | T], R)`) and misses the rules for other operations. This incompleteness leads to an incorrect result (0.0000) when running the query, whereas the original code correctly computes the result (-10.333333333333332)."
