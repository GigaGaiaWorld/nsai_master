  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there are some issues in the form of redundant definitions (e.g., `prove(true)` and `prove(Goal)` are duplicated) and a logical error in the `implies` rule where it requires both A and B to be provable, which contradicts the original intention of P ⇒ Q (P implies Q). The running results are consistent with the original code, but the form has flaws."
