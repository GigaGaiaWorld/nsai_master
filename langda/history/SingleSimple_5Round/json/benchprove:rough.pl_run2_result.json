  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there are some redundancies, such as the duplicate definitions of 'prove(true)', 'prove(Goal)', and 'prove((A,B))'. The 'implies' predicate in the generated code is incorrectly defined as 'prove(implies(A,B)) :- prove(A), prove(B)', which differs from the original's definition that allows for P being unprovable or Q being provable. Despite this, the running results are consistent with the original code, likely due to the specific queries used."
