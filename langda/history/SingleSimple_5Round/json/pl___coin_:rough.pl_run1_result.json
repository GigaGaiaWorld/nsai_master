  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause error, which occurs because the variable 'C' in 'coin(C)' is not properly instantiated before being used in the probabilistic choice. This differs from the original code where 'CNT' is used directly in 'coin(CNT)'. The generated code fails to run due to this error, while the original code runs successfully and produces the expected probabilistic results."
