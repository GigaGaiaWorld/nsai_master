  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The main issue is that the generated code incorrectly repeats the definitions of predicates like 'digit', 'leftdigit', 'all_different', 'member', and 'sumdigit' within the 'query_sum' predicate, which is syntactically incorrect and leads to a malformed Prolog program. Additionally, the running results are inconsistent; the original code produces specific solutions, while the generated code only outputs a generic form without concrete values, indicating it does not function as intended."
