  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog, with identical logic for inserting elements and sorting lists. The generated code produces the same sorted result as the original code when queried with the list [3,1,2,5,7,12]. There are no apparent problems or deviations in the generated code."
