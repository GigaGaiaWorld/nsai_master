  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It includes all the necessary predicates and rules, such as member/2, prove/1 for various logical operations, and the example queries. The formatting and comments are slightly different but do not affect the code's behavior. The generated code meets the requirements and produces the same results as the original code."
