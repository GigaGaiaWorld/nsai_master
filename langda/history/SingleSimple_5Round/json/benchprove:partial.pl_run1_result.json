  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It correctly implements the meta-interpreter and extended logic processing, including the handling of implies, opposite, expand, includes, extend, and refute. The only minor differences are in formatting and the absence of the 'square' expand rule in the generated code, which does not affect the given queries. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected outcomes."
