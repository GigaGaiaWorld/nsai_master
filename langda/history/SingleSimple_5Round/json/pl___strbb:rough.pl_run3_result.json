  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it duplicates the definition of 'pick' and 'palindrome' predicates, which is unnecessary and could lead to confusion. Second, the 'bb' predicate in the generated code incorrectly uses 'between(1,N,I)' instead of 'Max is N-1, between(1,Max,I)' as in the original code, leading to a different probability calculation. This results in a different output probability (1.0000 vs 0.3750). The generated code is not consistent with the original code in both form and result."
