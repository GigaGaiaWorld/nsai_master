  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. It incorrectly duplicates the definitions of predicates like 'digit', 'leftdigit', 'all_different', 'member', and 'sumdigit' within the 'query_sum' predicate, which is syntactically incorrect and leads to confusion. The original code clearly separates these definitions and uses them appropriately within the 'query_sum' predicate. Additionally, the generated code's result is incomplete and does not list specific solutions like the original code does, instead providing a generic output with variables."
