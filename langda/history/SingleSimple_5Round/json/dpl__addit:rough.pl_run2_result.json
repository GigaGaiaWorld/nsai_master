  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle lists of digits and form multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The code is logically consistent with the original, which only handled single-digit addition. The generated code correctly computes the sum of 79 and 312 as 391, demonstrating its validity. Both the form and the result are correct and meet the requirements."
