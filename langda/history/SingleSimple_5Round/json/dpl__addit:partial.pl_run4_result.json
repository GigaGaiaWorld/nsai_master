  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define the same digit facts and the addition predicate, which correctly sums the digits associated with the images. The only difference is the formatting of the addition predicate, which does not affect the logic or the output. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same output for the query."
