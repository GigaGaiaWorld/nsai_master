  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference lies in the reformatting and slight restructuring of the `attempted_flap_position` predicate, which does not affect the overall behavior. The generated code maintains the same probabilistic model and query structure, producing identical results to the original code."
