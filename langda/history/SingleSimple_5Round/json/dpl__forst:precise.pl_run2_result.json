  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The main difference is the replacement of 'insertion_sort' with the built-in 'sort' predicate, which is functionally equivalent for the purpose of sorting elements. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements. The running results of both pieces of code are identical, confirming their consistency."
