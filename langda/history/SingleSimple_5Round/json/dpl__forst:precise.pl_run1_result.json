  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The only difference is the use of 'sort0' instead of 'insertion_sort' in the sorting operation, but since the results are consistent, it implies that 'sort0' functions similarly to 'insertion_sort'. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code meets the requirements."
