  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The main predicate `query_sum` in the generated code has incorrect logic for simulating the column addition, specifically in the `sumdigit` calls. The original code correctly models the addition of AB + BCD = CDE, while the generated code incorrectly attempts to sum A+B and B+C without aligning with the original problem's requirements. Additionally, the generated code's result is nonspecific (showing variables X6-X10) and does not match the original code's specific solutions."
