  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it misses the crucial 'play/3' and 'result/3' predicates which are essential for determining the game results. The original code includes these predicates to recursively process each round of moves and compute the outcome, while the generated code omits them, leading to a runtime error. The generated code also redundantly repeats the 'move/1' and 'beats/2' facts. The running results are inconsistent due to the missing logic in the generated code."
