  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the functionality of the original code but introduces several issues. The main problem is in the redefinition of predicates like 'implies', 'opposite', 'expand', 'includes', and 'extend' outside the 'prove' framework, which conflicts with the original meta-interpreter structure. This leads to a timeout error during execution, indicating that the generated code is not functionally equivalent to the original. The original code correctly embeds these predicates within the 'prove' predicate, ensuring proper meta-interpretation."
