  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for draw cases. The original code correctly updates the score with 'S is S1', while the generated code mistakenly uses 'compute_score(Rs, S)' which doesn't properly propagate the score. However, this error doesn't affect the final result in this specific test case because the score calculation still works correctly for win/lose cases, and the draw case doesn't change the score."
