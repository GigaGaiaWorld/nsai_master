  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It accurately models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes of keeping or switching choices. The generated code simplifies some conditions and adds clarity by explicitly stating 'A \\= B' to ensure different doors are considered, which is implicitly handled in the original code. Both codes produce identical results, confirming their equivalence."
