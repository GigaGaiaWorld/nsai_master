  "final_report": "The generated code has a significant issue in the 'attempted_flap_position' rule. It incorrectly calculates the new position by subtracting the actuator strength instead of considering the direction towards the goal (using sign(GP-Old)). This leads to different probabilities in the results compared to the original code. The generated code is syntactically valid but logically incorrect for the intended behavior."
