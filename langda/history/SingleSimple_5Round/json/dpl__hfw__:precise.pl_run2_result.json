  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, which leads to incorrect handling of operator precedence and associativity. Specifically, it fails to properly handle nested expressions like division and multiplication, resulting in a runtime error due to non-ground arguments in the 'almost_equal' predicate. The original code correctly processes these operations by first evaluating nested expressions before applying the operators."
