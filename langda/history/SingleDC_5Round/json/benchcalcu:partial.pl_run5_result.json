  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, solving the same cryptarithmetic puzzle with identical results. The structure and logic are preserved, though the formatting is slightly different with more line breaks. The generated code correctly maintains all constraints (digit uniqueness, non-zero leading digits, and addition rules) and produces the same solutions as the original. No functional issues were found."
