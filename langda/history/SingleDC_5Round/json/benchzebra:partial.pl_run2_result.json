  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code, but there is a minor discrepancy in the predicate 'my_member(house(_, _, snail, _, winstons), Houses)' where 'snail' should be 'snails' as in the original code. Despite this, the running results of both pieces of code are consistent, producing the same output. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, but the inconsistency in the predicate could potentially cause issues in other contexts."
