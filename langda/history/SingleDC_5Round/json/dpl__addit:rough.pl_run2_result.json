  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle lists of images representing multi-digit numbers and their conversion to numerical values. The 'multi_addition' predicate then performs addition on these multi-digit numbers. The generated code is consistent with the original code's logic but adds more complex functionality. Both the form and result are valid, with the generated code correctly calculating the sum of 79 and 312 to get 391."
