  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. However, the sorting operation in the generated code is simplified and uses the built-in 'sort' predicate instead of the custom 'insertion_sort' used in the original code. This change does not affect the functionality for the given queries but may behave differently for more complex cases. The running results of both pieces of code are identical for the provided queries."
