  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The generated code simplifies the split_list predicate into split, which is more concise but equally effective. The merge and append predicates are identical in both codes. The running results of both codes are consistent, confirming the correctness of the generated code."
