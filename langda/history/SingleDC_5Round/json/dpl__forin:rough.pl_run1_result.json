  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The only difference is the renaming of the predicate 'insert_element' to 'insert' in the generated code, which does not affect the logic or outcome. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
