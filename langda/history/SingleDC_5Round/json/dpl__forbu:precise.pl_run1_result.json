  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the 'swap' predicate definition: the original code uses negation as failure (\\+) for the swap case, while the generated code explicitly defines the conditions for swap and no_swap. This change in implementation does not affect the overall behavior or results."
