  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The key components such as the meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, and example queries are preserved. However, there are minor formatting differences, such as the placement of operators and line breaks, which do not affect the functionality. The generated code omits the 'square' expand rule from the examples, but this does not impact the given queries. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected outcomes."
