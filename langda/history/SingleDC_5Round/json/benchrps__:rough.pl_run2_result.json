  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. It simplifies the result calculation by combining the three possible outcomes (win, lose, draw) into a single predicate play_round/3, which makes the code more concise. The logic for computing scores and determining the winner remains unchanged. Both codes produce the same result for the given query, indicating that the generated code meets the expectations."
