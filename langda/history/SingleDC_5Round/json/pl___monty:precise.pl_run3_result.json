  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly models the Monty Hall problem and produces the same results. However, the generated code has some minor syntactic differences, such as the addition of 'select_door(S)' in the 'open_door' clauses, which does not affect the logic but is unnecessary. The running results of both codes are consistent, showing the same probabilities for all queries."
