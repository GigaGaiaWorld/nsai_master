  "final_report": "The generated code has significant issues compared to the original code. While it maintains the same structure for detecting numbers and operators, the parsing logic for mathematical operations is incorrect. The original code handles operator precedence correctly by processing multiplication and division immediately, while the generated code attempts to parse all operations left-to-right without considering precedence. This leads to incorrect calculations and runtime errors. The error message shows the generated code fails to execute due to invalid argument types in the 'almost_equal' predicate."
