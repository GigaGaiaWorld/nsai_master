  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing identical results. The main difference is in the formatting and a slight restructuring of the 'attempted_flap_position' rule, which now uses an intermediate 'Direction' variable. This change does not affect the logic or outcomes. Both codes correctly model the aircraft flap controller scenario with the same probability distributions for goal achievement and overrun exceptions."
