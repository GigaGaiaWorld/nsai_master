  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect. It lacks definitions for several stack operations (pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that were present in the original code. As a result, the generated code fails to produce correct results for most of the queries, returning 0.0000 probability for all operations except push. The generated code also lacks the insertion_sort predicate which is necessary for the sort operation to work. The form is invalid due to missing critical components, and the results are inconsistent with the original code."
