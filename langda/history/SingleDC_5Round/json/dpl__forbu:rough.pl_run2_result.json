  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same sorted result for the given input. However, the implementation differs in the 'swap' predicate, where the generated code uses a different approach (direct comparison and swapping) compared to the original code (using a 'hole' predicate with swap/no_swap flags). Both versions correctly implement a bubble sort algorithm. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, though it uses a different stylistic approach."
