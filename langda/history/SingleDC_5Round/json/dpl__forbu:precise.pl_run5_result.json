  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the definition of the swap predicate: the original code uses negation as failure (\\+) for the swap case, while the generated code explicitly defines both cases (X > Y for swap and X =< Y for no_swap). This change does not affect the correctness or the result of the program."
