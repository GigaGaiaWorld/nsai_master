  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. However, the sorting operation in the generated code is slightly different as it directly uses the built-in 'sort' predicate instead of the custom 'insertion_sort' used in the original code. This change does not affect the functionality but deviates from the original implementation. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected behavior."
