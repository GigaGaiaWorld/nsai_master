  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of parsing logic. The original code correctly handles operator precedence by transforming subtraction into addition with a negative number and properly grouping multiplication and division operations. The generated code fails to maintain this precedence, leading to incorrect calculation results. Specifically, the generated code processes operators left-to-right without considering precedence, resulting in -0.25 instead of the correct -10.333333333333332."
