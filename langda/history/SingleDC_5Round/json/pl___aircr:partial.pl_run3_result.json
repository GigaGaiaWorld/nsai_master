  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main differences are in formatting and minor syntactic variations (like line breaks and spacing), which do not affect the program's behavior. The generated code correctly implements the aircraft flap controller logic, including the actuator selection, wind effect modeling, and position tracking. Both codes produce identical results when run, indicating that the generated code meets the expected requirements."
