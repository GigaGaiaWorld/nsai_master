  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but contains a critical error. It uses 'member/2' instead of 'my_member/2', which leads to a runtime error because 'member/2' is not defined. The original code correctly uses 'my_member/2'. Additionally, there is a minor inconsistency where 'snails' is written as 'snail' in the generated code. These issues prevent the generated code from running successfully."
