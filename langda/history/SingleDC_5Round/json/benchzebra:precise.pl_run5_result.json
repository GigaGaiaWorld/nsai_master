  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and does not meet the expectations. It only includes one constraint (the English person in the red house) from the original code, missing all other constraints that define the zebra puzzle. The form of the code is valid Prolog syntax, but it's not a complete solution to the problem. The results show multiple possible configurations with unbound variables, indicating the solution space wasn't properly constrained as in the original code."
