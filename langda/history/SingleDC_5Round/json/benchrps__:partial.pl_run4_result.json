  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for 'draw' cases. The original code correctly updates the score by maintaining the current value (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes Rs directly without updating the score. However, this does not affect the final result in this specific query. The running results of both codes are consistent."
