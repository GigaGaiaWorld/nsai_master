  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same sorting result. However, it simplifies the logic by combining the 'hole' and 'swap' predicates into a single 'swap' predicate with four arguments. This change makes the code more concise while maintaining the same behavior. Both versions correctly implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce identical results for the given query."
