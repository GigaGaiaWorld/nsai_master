  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The generated code is valid and correctly implements the extended functionality, as evidenced by the correct result (79 + 312 = 391). The original code only handled single-digit addition, while the generated code handles multi-digit addition, showing consistency in logic but expanded capability."
