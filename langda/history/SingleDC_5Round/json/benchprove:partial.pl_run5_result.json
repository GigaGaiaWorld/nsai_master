  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the essential components, including the meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, and example queries. The only minor differences are formatting and spacing, which do not affect functionality. The generated code produces the same results as the original code, confirming its correctness."
