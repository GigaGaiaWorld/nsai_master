  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The only differences are minor formatting changes, such as spacing and line breaks, which do not affect the code's execution or results. All the extended logic processing rules and examples are preserved, and the queries remain unchanged. The generated code meets the requirements and produces the same results as the original code."
