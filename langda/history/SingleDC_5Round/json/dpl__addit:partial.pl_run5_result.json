  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define digit facts and an addition rule that sums the values of two digits. The generated code uses different variable names (A, B) instead of (X2, Y2) in the addition rule, but this does not affect the logic or outcome. The query and results are identical in both cases, producing the same output."
