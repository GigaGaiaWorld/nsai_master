  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes simulate flipping a biased coin (with a probability of 0.8) four times and count the number of successful outcomes. The generated code splits the recursive cases into two separate clauses for clarity, which is a valid and often preferred style in logic programming. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
