Validity_form:True\Validity_result:False
The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a significant difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code simplifies the condition by directly using 'pick(I+1, b)' instead of calculating 'II is I+1' and then using 'pick(II, b)'. This simplification does not affect the logical correctness but leads to a different probability calculation, resulting in a different run result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results due to the altered probability calculation.
