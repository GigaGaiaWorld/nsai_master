Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes simulate flipping a biased coin (with a 0.8 probability of success) four times and count the number of successful outcomes. The generated code simplifies the original by separating the success and failure cases into distinct clauses, making it more readable while maintaining the same probabilistic behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence.
