The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic and produces the same results as the original code. The main difference is in the implementation of the 'open_door' rule, where the generated code uses a more concise approach with 'findall' and 'length' to ensure only valid doors are considered. Both codes correctly calculate the probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice, demonstrating consistency with the expected behavior of the Monty Hall problem.
