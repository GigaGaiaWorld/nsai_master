The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It accurately models the Monty Hall problem and produces the same results as the original code. The main differences are in the syntax and structure, where the generated code uses more explicit conditions and variable names, making it slightly clearer. Both codes correctly calculate the probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the door.
