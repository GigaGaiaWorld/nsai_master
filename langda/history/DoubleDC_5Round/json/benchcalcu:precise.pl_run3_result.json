  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes solve the same cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with identical constraints. The generated code has a slightly different formatting and combines some conditions in the query_sum predicate, but the logic remains the same. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expectations."
