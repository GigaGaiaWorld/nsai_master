  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and produces the same result as the original code. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm, but the generated code uses a different approach with an accumulator pattern. The generated code is more concise and avoids the use of auxiliary predicates like 'hole' and 'swap'. The logic is consistent with the original, and the running results match exactly."
