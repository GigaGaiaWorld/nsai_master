  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. However, there is a minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for the 'draw' case. The original code correctly computes the score as 'S is S1', while the generated code incorrectly uses 'compute_score(Rs, S)' which will not properly propagate the score. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent for the given query."
