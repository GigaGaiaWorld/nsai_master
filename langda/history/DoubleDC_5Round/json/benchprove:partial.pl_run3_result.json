  "final_report": "The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the core functionalities, including the meta-interpreter and extended logic processing. The only minor issue is the formatting of some clauses, such as the 'implies' and 'extend' predicates, which are less readable due to missing spaces and line breaks. However, these do not affect the functionality. The running results are identical to the original code, confirming that the generated code meets the requirements."
