  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the functionality of the original code, including the basic meta-interpreter and extended logic processing. The generated code simplifies some expressions, such as the 'implies' rule, but the logic remains equivalent. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming the correctness of the generated code."
