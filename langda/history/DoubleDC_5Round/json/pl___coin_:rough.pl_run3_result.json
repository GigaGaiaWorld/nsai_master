  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in both structure and results. The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips over 4 trials with an 80% success rate, resulting in a binomial distribution. The generated code incorrectly simplifies the logic by directly using 'heads' and 'tails' as constants, leading to incorrect probabilities. The generated code's results do not match the expected binomial distribution of the original code."
