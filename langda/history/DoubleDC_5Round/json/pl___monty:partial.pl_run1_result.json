  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It accurately models the Monty Hall problem and produces the same results as the original code. The main difference is in the formulation of the `open_door` rules, where the generated code uses `Selected` to explicitly reference the selected door, making the conditions clearer. This change does not affect the logic or outcomes."
