  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference is in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where the generated code uses 'goal_reached(Prev)' instead of 'goal(Old)' to check if the previous position was the goal. This change does not affect the overall behavior since both conditions effectively serve the same purpose in this context. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code produces the same probabilistic outcomes as the original."
