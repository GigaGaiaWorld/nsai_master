  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. The main difference lies in the reorganization of the 'at(robot, Pos, s(T))' clauses, which does not affect the overall functionality. The generated code maintains the same probabilistic rules and queries, and the running results are identical to those of the original code. There are no apparent problems in the generated code."
