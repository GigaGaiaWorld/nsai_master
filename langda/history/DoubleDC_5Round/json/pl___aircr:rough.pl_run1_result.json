  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference lies in the reformulation of the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, which has been rewritten for clarity but maintains the same operational semantics. The generated code produces identical results to the original code, as evidenced by the matching inference results."
