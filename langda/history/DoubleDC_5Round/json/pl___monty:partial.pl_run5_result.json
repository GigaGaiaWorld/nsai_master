  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It simplifies the conditions for opening a door by explicitly stating the constraints (A \\= Selected, B \\= Selected, A \\= B) which makes the code clearer while maintaining the same logical flow. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expectations."
