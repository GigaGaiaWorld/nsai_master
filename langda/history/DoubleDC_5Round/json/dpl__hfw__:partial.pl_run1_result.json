  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It correctly implements the number and operator detection, as well as the parsing logic for mathematical expressions. However, there is a minor formatting issue in the 'detect_all' predicate where the line breaks and indentation are inconsistent. Despite this, the generated code produces the same result as the original code when executed."
