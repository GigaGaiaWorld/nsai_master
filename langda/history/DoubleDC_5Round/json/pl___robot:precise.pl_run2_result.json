  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference lies in the reordering of conditions in some of the rules, particularly in the 'at(robot, Pos, s(T))' predicates. However, these changes do not affect the overall behavior of the program. The generated code maintains the same probabilistic facts and queries, ensuring that the semantic meaning remains unchanged. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code correctly replicates the original's behavior."
