  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The main issue lies in the implementation of the 'implies' predicate, which is incorrectly defined as a standalone rule rather than being integrated into the 'prove' meta-interpreter. Additionally, the generated code lacks implementations for 'opposite', 'includes', and 'extend' within the 'prove' framework, which are present in the original code. This results in all queries returning 0.0000, indicating failure, whereas the original code correctly returns 1.0000 for all queries."
