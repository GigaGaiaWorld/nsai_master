  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference is in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where the generated code uses 'goal_reached(Prev)' instead of 'goal(Old)' to check if the previous position was the goal. This change does not affect the behavior since 'goal_reached(Prev)' and 'goal(Old)' are equivalent in this context. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code meets the expectations."
