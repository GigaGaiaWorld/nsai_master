  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same correct sorting result. The logic for insertion sort and element insertion remains intact, though the formatting and spacing are less consistent in the generated version. The generated code maintains all the necessary predicates and conditions to perform the insertion sort correctly."
