  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It successfully replicates the logic of the original zebra puzzle solution, including all constraints and member checks. The only differences are in the formatting and the definition of 'next_to', which is now defined in terms of 'right_of' instead of having separate clauses. This change does not affect the functionality or results. Both codes produce identical output, solving the puzzle correctly."
