  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally correct and consistent with the original code. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog and produce the same sorted output for the given input list. The generated code maintains the same logic and structure as the original, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., line breaks and spacing). There are no functional or logical issues in the generated code."
