  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for the queries. The generated code simplifies some conditions by explicitly stating the constraints (e.g., A \\= Selected, B \\= Selected) which makes it clearer while maintaining the same logic. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
