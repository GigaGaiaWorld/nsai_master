  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the cryptarithmetic puzzle. The logic for digit constraints, sum calculations, and uniqueness checks remains consistent. However, the generated code has minor formatting issues (unnecessary line breaks and spaces) and a slightly rearranged predicate order in query_sum, which doesn't affect functionality. The generated code correctly maintains all the original constraints and calculations."
