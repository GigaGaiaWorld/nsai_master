  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes solve the same cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with identical constraints. The main difference is in the formatting and the order of constraints in the query_sum predicate. The generated code combines all constraints into a single line, which is syntactically valid but less readable. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same set of solutions with the same probabilities."
