  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. The main differences are in the formatting and the order of conditions in some rules, but these do not affect the logical meaning or the execution results. The generated code maintains the same probabilistic facts and rules, and the queries remain unchanged. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code correctly replicates the behavior of the original code."
