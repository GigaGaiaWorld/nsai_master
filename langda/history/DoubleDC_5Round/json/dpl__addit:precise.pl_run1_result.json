  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of images into multi-digit numbers and performs addition. This is a valid extension and demonstrates consistency with the original code's approach to digit recognition and arithmetic operations. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as evidenced by the successful execution and correct result (79 + 312 = 391)."
