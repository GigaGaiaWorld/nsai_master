  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The main difference is that the generated code uses the built-in 'sort' predicate instead of the custom 'insertion_sort' used in the original code. However, this does not affect the functionality as both achieve the same result. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
