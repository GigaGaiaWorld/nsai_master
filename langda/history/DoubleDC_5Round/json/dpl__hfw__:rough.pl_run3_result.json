  "final_report": "The generated code is valid in form and follows the structure of the original code. However, it modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, which leads to different results. The original code handles subtraction by converting it into a multiplication with -1, while the generated code directly performs subtraction. This change affects the operator precedence and results in a different output (11.666... vs -10.333...). The generated code's approach is simpler but doesn't maintain the original's behavior."
