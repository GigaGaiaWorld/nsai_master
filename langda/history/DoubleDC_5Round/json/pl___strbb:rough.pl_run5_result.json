  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a significant difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'Len is N-1' instead of 'Max is N-1' and combines the 'pick' calls into a single line. This change does not affect the logical correctness but leads to a different probability result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results with the original code."
