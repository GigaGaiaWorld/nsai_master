  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a significant difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'pick(I + 1, b)' instead of the original 'II is I + 1, pick(II, b)'. This change affects the probability calculation, leading to a different result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements, but the result inconsistency indicates a logical deviation from the original intent."
