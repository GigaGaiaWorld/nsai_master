  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It accurately models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for prize placement, door selection, and the rules for opening doors. The generated code simplifies some conditions by using 'A \\= B' instead of 'A < B', which does not affect the outcome. Both codes produce identical results, confirming the validity of the generated code."
