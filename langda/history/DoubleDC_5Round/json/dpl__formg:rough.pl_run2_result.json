  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'split' function. The original code uses 'split_list' with 'append', while the generated code uses a more straightforward recursive 'split' function. Both approaches are valid and achieve the same result. The generated code meets the requirements and is valid."
