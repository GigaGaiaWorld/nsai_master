  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. However, there is a critical issue in the generated code where the 'determine_winner' predicate produces multiple results (both 'Player 2' and 'Draw') for the same input, which is incorrect. The original code correctly produces only one result ('player2'). This inconsistency arises due to the way the conditions are structured in the generated code, leading to multiple valid solutions being returned."
