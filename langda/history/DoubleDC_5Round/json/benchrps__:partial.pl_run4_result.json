  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for 'draw' cases. The original code correctly updates the score by maintaining the current value (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes Rs directly without updating the score (compute_score(Rs, S)). This could lead to incorrect score calculations in some cases. However, in the specific test case provided, both codes produce the same result (player2 wins) because the error doesn't affect this particular scenario."
