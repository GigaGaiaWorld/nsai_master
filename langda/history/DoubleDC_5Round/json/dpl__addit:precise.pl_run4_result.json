  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle multi-digit numbers and 'multi_addition' to perform addition on these numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly processes lists of images representing digits and performs the addition accurately. The running results of both codes are consistent with their respective goals, with the original code adding single-digit numbers and the generated code handling multi-digit numbers."
