  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of images into their corresponding numerical values and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these numbers. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as it successfully calculates the sum of numbers represented by lists of images. The result is consistent with the original code's logic but operates on a more complex input format."
