  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. The main difference lies in the reorganization of the 'at(robot, Pos, s(T))' clauses, which are now more explicitly separated based on the success or failure of the goto action. This change does not affect the overall logic or the results. Both codes produce identical results when run, indicating that the generated code correctly implements the intended behavior of the original code."
