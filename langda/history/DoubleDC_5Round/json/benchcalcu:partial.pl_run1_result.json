  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the cryptarithmetic puzzle. The logic for digit constraints, sum calculations, and uniqueness checks remains consistent. However, the generated code has minor formatting issues (unnecessary line breaks and spaces) and redundant digit checks for B and C (already covered by leftdigit). These don't affect functionality but slightly reduce readability."
