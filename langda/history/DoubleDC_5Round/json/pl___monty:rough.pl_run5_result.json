  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic and produces the same results as the original code. The main difference is in the implementation of the 'open_door' predicate, where the generated code uses a more concise approach with 'findall' and 'length' to ensure the door opened by Monty is neither the selected door nor the prize door. This change does not affect the correctness or the outcome of the program. Both codes correctly show a 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice and a 2/3 chance by switching."
