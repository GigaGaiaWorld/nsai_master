  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The only differences are minor formatting changes, such as spacing and line breaks, which do not affect the code's execution or results. The generated code maintains all the essential components of the original, including the meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, examples, and queries. Both codes produce identical results when run."
