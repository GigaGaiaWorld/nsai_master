  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a critical issue in the determine_winner predicate where the conditions for determining the winner are not properly grouped, leading to incorrect results. The original code correctly uses parentheses to group the conditions, while the generated code does not, causing it to return multiple results (both 'Player 2' and 'Draw') for the same query. This is a logical error that affects the correctness of the output."
