  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The generated code is valid and correctly implements the extended functionality, as evidenced by the correct result (79 + 312 = 391). While the form differs from the original (handling lists of digits vs single digits), the core concept of digit recognition and arithmetic operations remains consistent."
