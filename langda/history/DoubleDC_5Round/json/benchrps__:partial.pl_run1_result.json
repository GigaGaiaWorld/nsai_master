  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate where the clause for 'draw' incorrectly passes 'S1' directly instead of assigning it to 'S'. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output for the given query."
