  "final_report": "The generated code has significant differences from the original code. The main issues are: 1) The 'carrying' predicate in the generated code is missing critical conditions (at(robot,Pos,T) and at(key,Pos,T)) in the first clause and missing action checks (+do(putdown(key),T) and +do(pickup(key),T)) in the second clause. 2) The 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))' predicate is restructured but functionally equivalent. These changes lead to different probability calculations, as seen in the results where carrying probability jumps from 0.4331 to 0.8743."
