  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm and produces the same result as the original code. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'split' function, which in the generated code splits the list by alternating elements between the left and right sublists, whereas the original code splits the list into two halves based on length. Despite this difference in approach, both implementations correctly divide the list for sorting. The 'merge' function is identical in both codes and correctly merges the sorted sublists. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
