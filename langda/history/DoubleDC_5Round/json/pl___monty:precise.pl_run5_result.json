  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly models the Monty Hall problem and produces the same results. However, there are minor syntactic differences, such as the addition of 'select_door(Selected)' in the open_door rules, which does not affect the logic but is unnecessary. The generated code is consistent with the original in terms of behavior and results."
