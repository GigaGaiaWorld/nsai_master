  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main differences are in formatting and minor syntactical adjustments, such as line breaks and spacing, which do not affect the code's execution. The generated code correctly implements the aircraft flap controller logic, including the wind strength model, actuator selection, and position calculation. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected requirements."
