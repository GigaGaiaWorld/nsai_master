  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but contains a critical error. The predicate 'member' is used instead of 'my_member', which causes the program to fail because 'member/2' is not defined. Additionally, 'snail' is used instead of 'snails', which is a typographical error. These issues make the generated code invalid and prevent it from producing the same result as the original code."
