  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It includes all the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation with the same logic. However, there is a redundancy in the generated code where the 'stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)' and 'get_top_n' predicates are duplicated. The insertion sort implementation is correctly added and functional. Despite the redundancy, the generated code produces the same results as the original code."
