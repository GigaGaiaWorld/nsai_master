  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, the 'prove(expand(Goal, Result))' clause incorrectly uses 'call(Goal, Result)' instead of 'expand(Goal, Result)', leading to an error when evaluating 'double/2'. Second, the 'prove(extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]))' clause is missing the body, which should verify the equality. The generated code is not consistent with the original code in these aspects, causing it to fail during execution."
