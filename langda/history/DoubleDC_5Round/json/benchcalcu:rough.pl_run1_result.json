  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results. The main differences are in formatting (spacing and line breaks) and the consolidation of constraints in the query_sum predicate. The logic remains unchanged, and all constraints and operations are preserved. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
