  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' that converts lists of images into their corresponding numerical values. The 'multi_addition' predicate then performs addition on these numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly calculates the sum of numbers represented by lists of images. The result is consistent with the original code's logic, just extended to handle multi-digit numbers."
