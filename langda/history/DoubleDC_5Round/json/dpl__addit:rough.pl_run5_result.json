  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of images into their corresponding numerical values and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these numbers. The code is correct and meets the requirements, demonstrating consistency with the original code's logic while adding more complex functionality. The running results are correct and consistent with the expected behavior."
