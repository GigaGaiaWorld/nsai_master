  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the definition of the swap predicate: the original code uses negation as failure (\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)) for the swap case, while the generated code directly checks X > Y for swap and X =< Y for no_swap. This change is logically equivalent and does not affect the outcome. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
