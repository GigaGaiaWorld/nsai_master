  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes solve the same cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with identical results. However, the generated code has minor formatting issues (unnecessary line breaks and spaces) and a slightly different arrangement of constraints in the query_sum predicate. The logic remains the same, and the results are identical, indicating correct implementation."
