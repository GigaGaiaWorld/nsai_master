<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door revealing no prize and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and verify the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails to execute due to a **ParseError** at line 8, column 29, indicating an **operator priority clash**. No queries were successfully evaluated, and thus no probability results are available.

**Failed Queries:**  
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed due to the parsing error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** Line 8, column 29.  
- **Affected Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
  ```  
- **Issue:** The syntax for probabilistic disjunction is incorrect. ProbLog does not support direct probabilistic annotations on disjunctions (`;`) in this form.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The intended logic (randomly opening one of two non-prize doors) is sound, but the syntax violates ProbLog's rules for probabilistic facts and disjunctions.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code attempts to assign probabilities to disjunctions, which is not allowed. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be defined separately and combined using logical rules.  
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical structure is correct, but syntax is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to syntax errors.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle cases where the host's door-opening logic might be ambiguous (e.g., multiple valid doors to open).  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not relevant here.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Operator priority clash     | Code fails to parse             | Rewrite the probabilistic disjunction using separate probabilistic facts.  |
| 2   | Incorrect probabilistic syntax | Probabilities not computed      | Define `open_door` as separate probabilistic facts and combine logically. |

---

#### **Suggested Fix**  
Replace the problematic line with:  
```prolog
0.5::open_door_a(A, B) ; 0.5::open_door_b(A, B) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    A < B,
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ prize(B),
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ select_door(B).
```  

This separates the probabilistic choices into distinct facts, adhering to ProbLog's syntax rules.

---

**Word Count:** 450  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code requires syntax corrections to align with ProbLog's probabilistic modeling rules. Once fixed, the logic should correctly model the Monty Hall problem.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
