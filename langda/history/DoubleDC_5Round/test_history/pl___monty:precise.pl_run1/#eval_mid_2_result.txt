### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door revealing no prize and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and verify the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails to execute due to a **ParseError** at line 8, column 29, indicating an **operator priority clash**. No queries were successfully evaluated, and thus no probability results are available.

**Failed Queries:**  
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed due to the parsing error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** Line 8, column 29.  
- **Affected Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
  ```  
- **Issue:** The syntax for probabilistic disjunction is incorrect. ProbLog does not support direct probabilistic annotations on disjunctions (`;`) in this form.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The intended logic (randomly opening one of two non-prize doors) is sound, but the syntax violates ProbLog's rules for probabilistic facts and disjunctions.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code attempts to assign probabilities to disjunctions, which is not allowed. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be defined separately and combined using logical rules.  
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical structure is correct, but syntax is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to syntax errors.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle cases where the host's door-opening logic might be ambiguous (e.g., multiple valid doors to open).  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not relevant here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Operator priority clash     | Code fails to parse             | Rewrite the probabilistic disjunction using separate probabilistic facts.  |
| 2   | Incorrect probabilistic syntax | Probabilities not computed      | Define `open_door` as separate probabilistic facts and combine logically. |

---

#### **Suggested Fix**  
Replace the problematic line with:  
```prolog
0.5::open_door_a(A, B) ; 0.5::open_door_b(A, B) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    A < B,
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ prize(B),
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ select_door(B).
```  

This separates the probabilistic choices into distinct facts, adhering to ProbLog's syntax rules.

**Word Count:** 450  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code requires syntax corrections to align with ProbLog's probabilistic modeling rules. Once fixed, the logic should correctly model the Monty Hall problem.
