  "HASH": "9BA21093",
  "ErrorSummary": "The `almost_equal/2` predicate is called with non-ground arguments during arithmetic comparison, violating ProbLog's groundness requirement. This causes a `CallModeError` when evaluating expressions.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the `almost_equal/2` predicate to ensure `Y` is ground before arithmetic evaluation. Update the predicate as follows:\n\n```prolog\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- \n    ground(Y), \n    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- \n    var(Y), \n    Y is float(X).\n```\n\nAdditionally, ensure the `parse/2` rules pass ground values to `almost_equal/2` by restructuring the arithmetic operations.",
