{
  "HASH": "9BA21093",
  "ErrorSummary": "The `almost_equal/2` predicate fails when called with non-ground arguments during arithmetic comparison, violating ProbLog's groundness requirements. This affects all `parse/2` rules that rely on it.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify `almost_equal/2` to enforce groundness before arithmetic evaluation. Example fix:\n```prolog\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- ground(Y), abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- var(Y), Y is float(X).\n```\nAdditionally, add input validation for the `parse/2` predicate to ensure lists alternate numbers and operators.",
