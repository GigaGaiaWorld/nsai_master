{"HASH": "9BA21093","ErrorSummary": "The parse/2 predicates for operations are not correctly handling operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation order (e.g., 2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7 should evaluate to -13.6667, not -0.25)","SuggestedFix": "Modify parse/2 to handle operator precedence by either: 1) restructuring the rules to process multiplication/division before addition/subtraction, or 2) adding parentheses handling in the symbol list parsing","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
