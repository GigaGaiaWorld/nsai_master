### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Zebra Puzzle**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Analyze test results and identify failures.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of the `member/2` predicate in the ProbLog environment. The error message is:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```  
- **Failed Query**: `member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)`.  
- **Expected Result**: Successful execution of the query to verify the presence of the specified house in the list.  
- **Actual Result**: Error due to undefined predicate.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `member/2`.  
- **Code Location**: Line 4.  
- **Issue**: The `member/2` predicate is not natively supported in ProbLog or is not defined in the provided code.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario**:  
  - The `member/2` predicate is a standard Prolog predicate for checking list membership. However, ProbLog does not support all Prolog built-ins, and `member/2` is not available by default.  
  - The code includes a custom `my_member/2` predicate, but it is not used in place of `member/2`.  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog restricts the use of certain Prolog predicates to maintain declarative semantics. The absence of `member/2` is a known limitation.  
  - The custom `my_member/2` predicate should replace `member/2` to resolve the issue.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The puzzle constraints are correctly encoded, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents full execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined predicates (`member/2`).  
  - Non-list inputs (not tested, but the custom `my_member/2` handles lists).  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem               | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `member/2`  | Prevents execution of the query. | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2`. |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. Replace `member/2` with the custom `my_member/2` predicate in the code.  
2. Verify all other predicates (e.g., `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) for compatibility with ProbLog.  
3. Test the updated code to ensure all constraints are correctly enforced.
