</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, verify test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules function as intended:
- **Predicates**:  
  - `move/1`, `beats/2`, `play_round/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, `determine_winner/3`.
- **Rules**:  
  - The recursive logic in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for all inputs.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The logic is sound, with correct termination conditions for recursion (e.g., empty list base cases).  
  - The `beats/2` predicate accurately models the game rules.  
- **ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The result is deterministic.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no neural network integration).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The game logic is correctly implemented.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Inputs**: The code assumes lists as input. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for typical game lengths but may degrade for very long move sequences.  
  - **Undefined Expansions**: No expansion predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used or required.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Non-list inputs cause errors | Runtime failure | Add input validation. |
| 2   | Deep recursion may degrade performance | Scalability issue | Optimize tail recursion or limit move length. |

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No critical issues were found. Suggestions for improvement focus on robustness and scalability.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
