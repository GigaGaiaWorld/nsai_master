### **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, verify test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules function as intended:
- **Predicates**:  
  - `move/1`, `beats/2`, `play_round/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, `determine_winner/3`.
- **Rules**:  
  - The recursive logic in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for all inputs.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The logic is sound, with correct termination conditions for recursion (e.g., empty list base cases).  
  - The `beats/2` predicate accurately models the game rules.  
- **ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The result is deterministic.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no neural network integration).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The game logic is correctly implemented.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Inputs**: The code assumes lists as input. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for typical game lengths but may degrade for very long move sequences.  
  - **Undefined Expansions**: No expansion predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used or required.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Non-list inputs cause errors | Runtime failure | Add input validation. |
| 2   | Deep recursion may degrade performance | Scalability issue | Optimize tail recursion or limit move length. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No critical issues were found. Suggestions for improvement focus on robustness and scalability.
