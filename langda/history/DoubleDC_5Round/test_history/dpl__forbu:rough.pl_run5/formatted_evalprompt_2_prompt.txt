System: You are a coding assistant. You should use the available tools to complete the task.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in ProbLog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to analyze the provided code and its test results, strictly following the instructions below.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>bubble([X], [], X).
bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :-
    (H1 =< H2, X1 = H1, bubble([H2 | T], T1, X));
    (H1 > H2, X1 = H2, bubble([H1 | T], T1, X)).

bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L1, X),
    bubblesort(L1, [X | Acc], Sorted).

forth_sort(L, L2) :- is_list(L), bubblesort(L, [], L2).

query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation and Error Resolution**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort` algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics. The test results indicate a successful execution, but further analysis is required to confirm robustness and edge-case handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**: The implementation correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The predicate `forth_sort/2` includes a guard `is_list(L)`, ensuring it fails gracefully for invalid inputs.  
  - **Empty List**: Handled by the base case `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3` predicates correctly implement the bubblesort algorithm.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: Ensured by the base cases (`bubble([X], [], X)` and `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`).  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - **Probabilistic Features**: Not utilized in this implementation (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Compliance**: The code adheres to ProbLog's declarative semantics, avoiding unsupported constructs like `->/2`.  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic annotations).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Input Validation**: Handled by `is_list(L)`.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No probabilistic features | Limited to classical sorting | Add probabilistic annotations if needed. |
| 2 | Performance for large lists | Potential stack overflow | Optimize with tail recursion or iterative methods. |

---

### **Recommendations**  
1. **Enhance Probabilistic Features**:  
   ```prolog
   0.7::bubble_step(swap); 0.3::bubble_step(no_swap).
   ```  
   (Example of adding probabilistic behavior to the sorting steps.)  

2. **Optimize for Large Lists**:  
   - Use tail-recursive predicates or iterative methods to avoid stack overflow.  

3. **Test Additional Edge Cases**:  
   - Include tests for lists with duplicate elements, already sorted lists, and very large lists.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
