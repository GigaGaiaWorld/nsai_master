</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The evaluation aims to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Identify logical or syntactic errors.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's constraints and best practices.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Test Query:**  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```  

**Result:**  
The test failed due to the use of the unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog. The error message indicated:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for '->/2' at 41:77.
```  

**Interpretation:**  
The `->/2` operator (if-then) is not supported in ProbLog, which caused the failure.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
- **Error Location:** Line 41, where the `->/2` operator is used in the `determine_winner` predicate.  
- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
      compute_score(Results, Score),
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic for determining the winner is correct in classical Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined and terminate as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no issues arise in this regard.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration is used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the implementation fails due to ProbLog's syntactic constraints.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this code.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled, which could cause runtime errors.  
  - The `->/2` operator is a critical oversight in ProbLog compatibility.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog | Test failure | Replace with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `(Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw')`) |
| 2   | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation or guards in predicates. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**  
Replace the `determine_winner` predicate with:  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
```  

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The code is logically sound but requires minor adjustments to comply with ProbLog's syntax. The primary issue is the use of the unsupported `->/2` operator, which can be easily replaced. Once corrected, the implementation should pass all tests. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the evaluation is limited to classical reasoning.

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
