### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and calculating the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Identify any logical or syntactic errors.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's constraints and best practices.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Result:**
The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```

**Interpretation:**
The error indicates that the `->/2` operator (if-then) is not supported in ProbLog, which is confirmed by the syntax notes. This is the root cause of the failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`
- **Error Location:** Line 41, where the `->/2` operator is used in the `determine_winner` predicate.
- **Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
      compute_score(Results, Score),
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic for determining the winner is correct in a classical Prolog context but fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined and terminate as expected.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no issues arise in this regard.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration is used, so this feature is not applicable.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the implementation fails due to ProbLog's syntactic constraints.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this code.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled, which could cause runtime errors.
  - The `->/2` operator is a critical oversight in ProbLog compatibility.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog | Test failure | Replace with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `(Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw')` |
| 2   | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation or guards in predicates. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**
Replace the `determine_winner` predicate with:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The code is logically sound but requires minor adjustments to comply with ProbLog's syntax. The primary issue is the use of the unsupported `->/2` operator, which can be easily replaced. Once corrected, the implementation should pass all tests. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the evaluation is limited to classical reasoning.
