### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The evaluation aims to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Identify logical or syntactic errors.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's constraints and best practices.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Test Query:**  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```  

**Result:**  
The test failed due to the use of the unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog. The error message indicated:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for '->/2' at 41:77.
```  

**Interpretation:**  
The `->/2` operator (if-then) is not supported in ProbLog, which caused the failure.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
- **Error Location:** Line 41, where the `->/2` operator is used in the `determine_winner` predicate.  
- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
      compute_score(Results, Score),
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic for determining the winner is correct in classical Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined and terminate as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no issues arise in this regard.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration is used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the implementation fails due to ProbLog's syntactic constraints.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this code.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled, which could cause runtime errors.  
  - The `->/2` operator is a critical oversight in ProbLog compatibility.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog | Test failure | Replace with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `(Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw')`) |
| 2   | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation or guards in predicates. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**  
Replace the `determine_winner` predicate with:  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
```  

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The code is logically sound but requires minor adjustments to comply with ProbLog's syntax. The primary issue is the use of the unsupported `->/2` operator, which can be easily replaced. Once corrected, the implementation should pass all tests. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the evaluation is limited to classical reasoning.
