### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness, logical structure, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements. The evaluation includes verifying test results, analyzing failures (if any), and ensuring compliance with functional and edge-case requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passes with a probability of 1.0000, indicating correct sorting.  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `swap/3`: Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on comparison.  
  - `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3`: Recursively sort the list and terminate correctly.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `swap/3` predicate correctly implements the comparison logic (`X > Y` for swapping).  
  - The `bubble/3` predicate recursively processes the list, ensuring the largest element "bubbles" to the end.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively sorts the remaining list and accumulates the sorted elements.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The base case `bubblesort([],L,L)` ensures termination when the input list is empty.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Compliance**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - The query result (`1.0000`) confirms deterministic behavior.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**:  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) or probabilistic implications are present.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement           | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning   | Met         | Correctly implements bubble sort in Prolog.                                 |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used  | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion may lead to stack overflow for very large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, `implies/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error        | Add input validation.               |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow       | Optimize for tail recursion.        |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The ProbLog bubble sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized, making it a purely classical Prolog implementation.
