### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Digit Addition**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Addition**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a simple digit recognition and addition system. It includes:  
- Facts for digits (`digit/2`) mapping images to numbers (e.g., `digit(img_1, 1)`).  
- A rule for addition (`addition/3`) that sums the numbers corresponding to two images.  
- A test query (`addition(img_5, img_6, Z)`) to verify the logic.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
1. Verify the correctness of the code and test results.  
2. Analyze compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.  
3. Ensure functional requirements (classical reasoning) are met.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `addition(img_5, img_6, Z)`  
  - **Result:** `addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000`  
  - **Verification:** Correct (5 + 6 = 11).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The following predicates were verified:  
- **`digit/2`:** Correctly maps images to numbers.  
- **`addition/3`:** Correctly sums the numbers from two images.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
  - The `addition/3` rule is logically correct and terminates as it relies on ground facts (`digit/2`).  
  - No recursion or complex control structures are used, avoiding termination issues.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P::fact`).  
  - No negation or implications are present, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are irrelevant here.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly performs digit addition.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes all `digit/2` facts are defined. Missing facts would cause failures.  
  - **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
  - **Performance:** No recursion or large datasets, so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem               | Impact               | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic facts | Limited functionality| Add probabilistic rules if needed.  |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog usage  | No neural integration| Consider `nn/3` for image analysis. |

**Final Notes:**  
The code is correct for classical reasoning but lacks advanced features like probabilistic or neural integration. Edge cases (e.g., undefined inputs) should be handled in larger applications.
