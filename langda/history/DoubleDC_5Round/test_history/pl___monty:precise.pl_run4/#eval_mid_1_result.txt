### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules.
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities are correct:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any door (`prize/1`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is 1/3.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is 2/3.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the problem's requirements:
- The host opens a door that is neither selected nor hides the prize.
- The host's choice is random when two doors are available.
- The probabilities align with the theoretical solution.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- Logical correctness is ensured by:
  - Proper use of `member/2` for door selection.
  - Correct negation (`\+`) to exclude invalid doors.
- Recursive termination is guaranteed as `member/2` operates on finite lists.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- Probabilities comply with rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled by negation.
  - The host's random choice (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`) ensures fairness.
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., door selection and prize exclusion).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (correct probability distributions).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not relevant here.
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable (`member/2` ensures list input).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue (shallow recursion).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and clear.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all requirements.
