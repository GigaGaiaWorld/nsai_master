### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Addition Logic**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Addition**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of `digit` facts and an `addition` predicate to perform arithmetic addition on the digits represented by images. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(addition(img_5, img_6, Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as the result matches the expected output (`5 + 6 = 11`).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The single test case provided passes successfully. The `addition` predicate correctly computes the sum of the digits associated with the images.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `addition` predicate is logically correct. It retrieves the numeric values of the images using `digit/2` and computes their sum using `is/2`.  
  - **Termination**: The predicate terminates as it does not involve recursion or infinite loops.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  The `digit` facts are deterministic (probability = 1.0). No probabilistic rules or facts are used in this example.  
  - **Compliance**: The code adheres to ProbLog's rules, but no probabilistic features (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are utilized.

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Neural Network Calls**:  
  No `nn/3` or `tensor` predicates are used.  
  **Conclusion**: DeepProbLog feature not used.

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement           | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning   | Met         | The `addition` predicate correctly performs arithmetic addition.            |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Met   | No probabilistic facts or rules are included.                               |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Met | No DeepProbLog features are used.                                          |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**:  
  The code does not handle cases where `digit(X, A)` or `digit(Y, B)` is undefined (e.g., `digit(img_10, _)`).  
- **Non-Image Inputs**:  
  The predicate assumes inputs are valid image identifiers (`img_1` to `img_0`). Non-conforming inputs may cause errors.

| 2   | Undefined inputs not handled     | Potential runtime errors   | Add validation for `digit/2` facts.         |
| 3   | DeepProbLog not utilized         | No neural integration      | Consider adding `nn/3` for advanced tasks.  |
