### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are summarized below:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [3, 1, 2, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. The following predicates were verified:
- `stack_op/3` (lines 1–7)
- `get_top_n/4` (lines 8–9)
- `insertion_sort/2` and auxiliary predicates (lines 10–18)

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `stack_op(pop, [X | Rest], Rest)` correctly removes the top element.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate terminates because the base case (`insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc)`) is always reachable.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. All operations are deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Integration:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations are correctly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms) would fail.
- **Deep Recursion:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate may face performance issues with large lists due to its recursive nature.
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime failure | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2   | Deep recursion in `insertion_sort/2` | Performance bottleneck | Optimize sorting for larger stacks. |

**Final Verdict:** The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. Minor improvements for edge cases are recommended.
