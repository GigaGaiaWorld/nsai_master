### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the logic, test results, and adherence to functional requirements. The evaluation focuses on:
- Classical Prolog reasoning (e.g., predicate definitions, recursion).
- Probabilistic reasoning (if applicable).
- Edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
**Query Tested:**
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Results:**
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],'Player 2') = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],'Draw') = 1.0000`

**Verification:**
- The query returns two results with probability `1.0000`, which is contradictory (a game cannot simultaneously be a win for Player 2 and a draw).
- **Failure Identified:** The test fails because the logic does not correctly handle the case where the score is zero (draw).

**Conclusion:**  
The test fails due to incorrect handling of the draw condition.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Predicate:**  
`determine_winner/3` (line: `<Langda>` block).

**Issue:**  
The predicate does not correctly handle the case where the computed score is zero (draw). The current implementation allows both `'Player 2'` and `'Draw'` to be returned with probability `1.0000` for the same input.

**Code Block with Error:**
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

**Problem:**  
The disjunction (`;`) in the condition does not enforce mutual exclusivity, leading to overlapping results.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are logically correct and terminate properly.
- The error lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, where the conditions for `win`, `lose`, and `draw` are not mutually exclusive.

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core logic (e.g., `beats/2`, `result/3`) is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `determine_winner(rock, paper, W)` would fail).
- Deep recursion performance is not an issue here due to small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Overlapping conditions in `determine_winner/3` | Incorrect results for draw cases | Modify the predicate to enforce mutual exclusivity (e.g., use `if-else` logic). |
| 2   | No input validation              | Crashes for non-list inputs     | Add checks for list inputs (e.g., `is_list/1`).                            |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code requires fixes in the `determine_winner/3` predicate to handle edge cases and ensure correct results. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
