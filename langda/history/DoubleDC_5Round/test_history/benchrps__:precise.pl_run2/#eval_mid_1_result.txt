### **Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Identify any logical or syntactic errors.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's constraints and requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Result:**
The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```

**Analysis:**
- The error indicates that the `->/2` operator (if-then) is not supported in ProbLog, as highlighted in the syntax notes.
- The `determine_winner` predicate uses `->/2` to conditionally assign the winner based on the score.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
```prolog
determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W).
```

**Error Location:**
- **Predicate:** `determine_winner/3`
- **Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
- **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is unsupported in ProbLog.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Context:**
- The logic for determining the winner is correct in classical Prolog, but the use of `->/2` is problematic in ProbLog.
- Recursive termination is correctly handled in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.

**ProbLog Context:**
- ProbLog does not support imperative control constructs like `->/2`. Instead, logical disjunction (`;`) should be used for conditional branching.
- The probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are not relevant here, as the code does not involve probabilistic facts.

**DeepProbLog:**
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the use of unsupported operators causes failure.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input is a list of moves. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the move lists, which is manageable for typical use cases.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator in `determine_winner/3` | Test failure | Replace `->/2` with logical disjunction (`;`) or use `if-then-else` emulation. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |

---

### **Suggested Fix**
Replace the problematic line in `determine_winner/3` with:
```prolog
(Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
```

This avoids the unsupported `->/2` operator while maintaining the same logic.
