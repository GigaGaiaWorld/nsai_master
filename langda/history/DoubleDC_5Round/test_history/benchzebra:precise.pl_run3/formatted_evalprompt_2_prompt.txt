<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for the Zebra Puzzle: Error in `member/2` Predicate**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" by defining house arrangements and constraints. The goal is to deduce the correct arrangement of houses based on given rules. However, the code fails during execution due to an undefined `member/2` predicate. This report analyzes the failure, its root cause, and provides suggestions for resolution.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed**: `zebra(Houses)`.  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: The test fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)`.  
- **Error Location**: Line 4 of the code.  
- **Root Cause**:  
  - ProbLog does not include a built-in `member/2` predicate.  
  - The code assumes `member/2` is available, but it must be explicitly defined.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - In standard Prolog, `member/2` is a built-in predicate. However, ProbLog restricts the set of available predicates to maintain declarative semantics.  
  - The error occurs because the predicate is neither built-in nor user-defined.  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog requires all predicates to be explicitly defined or imported from supported libraries.  
  - The absence of `member/2` violates this requirement, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  

- **Solution**:  
  - Define `member/2` explicitly in the code:  
    ```prolog
    member(X, [X|_]).
    member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
    ```  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic for house arrangement is correct, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **DeepProbLog Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined predicates (`member/2`).  
  - Non-list inputs to `member/2` (handled by the explicit definition).  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| #  | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1  | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Code fails to execute           | Define `member/2` explicitly.       |
| 2  | Assumption of built-in predicates | Misalignment with ProbLog specs | Verify predicate availability.      |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. **Define `member/2`**: Add the explicit definition to the code.  
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure the solution handles non-list inputs and recursive termination.  
3. **Documentation**: Clarify dependencies on user-defined predicates in the code comments.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.

This report adheres to the requested structure and provides actionable insights for resolving the issue. Let me know if further details are needed!

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
