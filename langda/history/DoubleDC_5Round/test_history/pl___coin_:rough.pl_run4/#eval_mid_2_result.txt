### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Error Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of `UnknownClause` Error in ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate coin tosses and count the number of heads (`SC`) after tossing `CNT` coins. However, the code fails with an `UnknownClause` error. This report analyzes the error, its root cause, and provides suggestions for resolution.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
  problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:13.
  ```
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to an undefined `->/2` (if-then) construct in ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `coins_r/3`  
- **Code Location:** Line 7 (`(coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC is SC)`).  
- **Issue:** ProbLog does not support the `->/2` (if-then) construct, which is a Prolog feature not available in ProbLog's probabilistic context.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct but fails due to the unsupported `->/2` construct.  
  - Termination is ensured by decrementing `CNT` until it reaches 0.  

- **ProbLog Context:**  
  - ProbLog restricts certain Prolog constructs (e.g., `->/2`) to maintain declarative semantics.  
  - The error occurs because the `->/2` operator is not recognized in ProbLog.  

- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but unsupported constructs cause failure).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the unsupported `->/2` construct.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Unsupported Prolog constructs (e.g., `->/2`) must be replaced with ProbLog-compatible alternatives.  
  - Recursive performance is acceptable for small `CNT` but may not scale well for large values.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` construct     | Code fails to execute           | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)`). |
| 2   | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | ProbLog rejects the model       | Instantiate `C` before using it in `make_coin(C,PH)`. For example, use a list of coin IDs. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the unsupported `->/2` construct with ProbLog-compatible logic:  
```prolog
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT), NSC is SC + 1 ; \+ coin(CNT), NSC is SC),
    NCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC, S, NCNT).
```

Ensure all probabilistic facts are ground:  
```prolog
% Ground probabilistic facts
0.8::coin(1).
0.8::coin(2).
0.8::coin(3).
0.8::coin(4).
```
