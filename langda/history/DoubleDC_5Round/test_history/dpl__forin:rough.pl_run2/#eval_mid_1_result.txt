### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in ProbLog: Logical Correctness and Probabilistic Compliance**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify:  
- Logical correctness in classical Prolog.  
- Compliance with probabilistic reasoning rules in ProbLog.  
- Functional requirements (interpretability, edge cases, and performance).  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query:**  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The query returns the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000, confirming the logical correctness of the algorithm.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `insertion_sort/2` (lines 1–3).  
  - `insert/3` (lines 4–7).  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Empty list: `insertion_sort([], [])` works as expected.  
  - Single-element list: `insertion_sort([X], [X])` is implicitly correct.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The algorithm correctly implements insertion sort by recursively inserting elements into a sorted sublist.  
  - Termination is guaranteed as the list shrinks with each recursive call (`insertion_sort(T, SortedTail)`).  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - Base case (`insertion_sort([], [])`) ensures termination.  

**ProbLog Compliance:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - No probabilistic facts are used in this code.  
- **Negations/Implications:**  
  - Not applicable here, as the code is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **"DeepProbLog feature not used."**

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Status       | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met          | Correctly implements insertion sort in Prolog.                              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used    | No `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls.                                            |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) will fail.  
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance may degrade for very large lists due to recursive calls.

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| No. | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling  | Runtime failure      | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2   | Deep recursion           | Performance issue    | Consider iterative implementation for large lists. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is logically correct and passes all provided tests. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs and may face performance issues with deep recursion. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.

**Code Block for Reference:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert(H, SortedTail, Sorted).
insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :-
    X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :-
    X > Y,
    insert(X, Ys, Zs).
```
