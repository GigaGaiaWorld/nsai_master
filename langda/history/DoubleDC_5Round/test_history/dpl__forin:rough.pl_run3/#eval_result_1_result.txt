  "HASH": "501F546D",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. The code correctly implements insertion sort and passes all test cases. However, it lacks handling for non-list inputs and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for list type (e.g., `is_list/1` check). 2. Optionally extend with probabilistic rules if needed (e.g., uncertain comparisons).",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
