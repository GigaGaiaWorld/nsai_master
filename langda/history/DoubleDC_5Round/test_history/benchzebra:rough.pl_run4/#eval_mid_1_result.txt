### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Zebra Puzzle**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle that requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of constraints. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on:  
- Correctness of the logical constraints.  
- Verification of test results.  
- Analysis of edge cases and potential pitfalls.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed**: `zebra(Houses)`.  
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
        house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
        house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
        house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
        house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The solution satisfies all constraints of the puzzle.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly checks adjacency using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly checks if one house is immediately to the right of another.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The constraints are logically sound and cover all puzzle conditions (e.g., color, nationality, pets, beverages, and brands).  
  - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The solution does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `p::`). It is purely deterministic.  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The solution correctly deduces the house arrangement.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code assumes valid input (e.g., `Houses` is a list of 5 houses). Non-list inputs would fail.  
  - **Performance**: Recursive predicates are efficient for small lists but may face performance issues with larger datasets.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The implementation is correct and meets all classical reasoning requirements. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases are minimal for this specific puzzle.
