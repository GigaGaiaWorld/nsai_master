### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Meta-Interpreter Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extending it with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the meta-interpreter.  
- Analyze test results and identify failures.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error, specifically:  
- **Error:** `No clauses found for 'double/2' at 33:20.`  
- **Impact:** The error occurs during execution, halting further evaluation of queries.  

**Failed Queries:**  
1. `prove(expand(double(3),6))`  
   - **Error:** `UnknownClause` due to undefined `double/2` predicate.  
2. All other queries (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) were not executed due to the initial error.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    query(prove(expand(double(3),6))).
    ```  
  - **Issue:** The `double/2` predicate is not defined in the program.  
  - **Line:** 33, Column: 20.  

- **Impact:** The undefined predicate prevents the query from being evaluated, halting execution.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The `expand/2` predicate is correctly defined but relies on `double/2`, which is missing.  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here, as the error occurs due to a missing predicate.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The error prevents verification of probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
  - The `expand/2` predicate, if corrected, should comply with ProbLog's probabilistic semantics.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (missing `double/2` predicate).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not verified due to execution error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` rules (e.g., non-numeric inputs) were not tested.  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` were not evaluated.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `double/2` predicate | Execution failure, halts evaluation | Define `double/2` as `double(X, Y) :- Y is X * 2.` |
| 2   | Untested edge cases      | Potential runtime errors        | Add test cases for invalid inputs.  |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The meta-interpreter has a critical error due to the undefined `double/2` predicate, which must be corrected before further testing. Once fixed, the remaining predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) should be verified for both classical and probabilistic correctness.  

**Word Count:** 420

**Final Note:**  
- Define the missing `double/2` predicate and rerun tests.  
- Expand test coverage to include edge cases.  
- Verify probabilistic compliance post-correction.
