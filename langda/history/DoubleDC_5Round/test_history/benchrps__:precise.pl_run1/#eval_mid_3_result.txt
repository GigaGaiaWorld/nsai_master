### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic rock-paper-scissors game, where two players submit sequences of moves, and the winner is determined based on the game's rules. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query Tested:**  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```

**Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Draw') = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- The results are contradictory because the same query cannot yield both `'Player 2'` and `'Draw'` as winners.  
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to incorrect logic in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Predicate:**  
- `determine_winner/3`  
- **Issue:** The predicate incorrectly allows both `'Player 2'` and `'Draw'` to be valid outcomes for the same input.  

**Code Block:**  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
```

**Problem:**  
- The disjunction (`;`) in the predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity, leading to multiple valid outcomes.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails to ensure a single, unambiguous result.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for valid inputs.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is involved.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core logic for determining game results is correct, but the final winner determination is flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
- **Empty Lists:** Handled correctly by `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.  
- **Deep Recursion:** No performance issues observed for typical game lengths.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Ambiguous winner determination  | Incorrect game results          | Modify `determine_winner/3` to enforce mutual exclusivity. |
| 2   | No input validation             | Crashes for non-list inputs     | Add checks for list inputs.                |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Note:**  
The code requires minor fixes to ensure correct winner determination and robustness against invalid inputs. The core logic for game rules is sound, but the final predicate needs refinement.
