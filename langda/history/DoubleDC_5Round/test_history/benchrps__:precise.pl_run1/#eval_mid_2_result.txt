### **Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code and Error Resolution**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining wins, losses, and draws, as well as a scoring mechanism. The goal is to evaluate the code's correctness, identify errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**:  
  The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically in the conditional logic (`->` operator).  
- **Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
- **Issue**:  
  ProbLog does not support the `->` (if-then) operator. This is a Prolog feature not available in ProbLog's subset of control constructs.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The logic for determining the winner is sound in Prolog but incompatible with ProbLog due to the unsupported `->` operator.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented and terminates as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails due to unsupported operator).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - The `->` operator is a critical oversight.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog | Code fails to execute | Replace with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `(Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw')`). |
| 2   | No input validation for non-lists | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for list inputs. |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. Replace the `->` operator with a ProbLog-compatible alternative (e.g., nested disjunctions).  
2. Add input validation for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` to ensure they are lists.  
3. Test the revised code with additional edge cases (e.g., empty lists, mixed gestures).  

**Word Count**: 450 words.
