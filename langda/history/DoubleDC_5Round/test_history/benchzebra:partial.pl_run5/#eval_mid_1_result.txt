### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation against the provided test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test result provided is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**.
- The output matches the expected solution, satisfying all constraints:
  - The owner of the red house is English.
  - The Spanish person has a dog.
  - The green house owner drinks coffee.
  - The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
  - The middle house drinks milk.
  - The zebra is owned by the Japanese person.
  - Someone drinks water.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**.
- All predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are correctly defined and function as intended.
- The code adheres to ProbLog's supported constructs (conjunction, disjunction, negation-as-failure, etc.).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code correctly implements the puzzle constraints using recursive predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`).
- **Termination**: Recursive predicates terminate as they reduce the list size in each iteration.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::fact`). It is purely deterministic.
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable here.
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Houses` is a list of 5 houses. No handling for invalid inputs.
- **Deep Recursion**: Not an issue due to the fixed list size (5 houses).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code solves the puzzle deterministically.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not utilized.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases**: The code is robust for the given problem but lacks input validation.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The implementation is correct and meets the puzzle requirements. No improvements are needed for the given scope.
