### **Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap movement, with queries to evaluate goal achievement and overrun exceptions. This report verifies the correctness of the code, analyzes test results, and ensures compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and logical semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions remain minimal.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, including:  
- `flap_position/2` (Line 10-12): Ensures legal flap movement.  
- `overrun_exception/1` (Line 15-17): Detects illegal flap positions.  
- `goal_reached/1` (Line 20-22): Validates goal achievement.  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `legal_flap_position/1`, `actuator_strength/2`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for flap movement (`attempted_flap_position/2`) and goal validation (`goal_reached/1`) are logically sound. Recursion terminates as the time steps are bounded (`at(5)`).  
- **Edge Cases:** The system handles edge cases such as illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception/1`) and ensures termination by limiting steps to 5.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind/1` and `wind_effect/2` comply with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`. For example, `wind(weak)` has `P(weak) = 0.7` and `P(¬weak) = 0.3`.  
- **Implications:** The rules for `attempted_flap_position/2` correctly compute the new position using probabilistic actuator selection and wind effects.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly models flap movement and goal validation.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for wind and actuator selection are correctly computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Undefined `expand/2`: Not applicable.  
- Non-list input: Not relevant here.  
- Deep recursive performance: Bounded by `at(5)`, ensuring termination.
