<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller: Error Diagnosis and Recommendations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating the movement of flaps under probabilistic conditions (actuator choice, wind effects). The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within 5 time steps. The code includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and legal flap positions. However, an error (`UnknownClause`) was encountered during evaluation.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Error Encountered**:  
  ```plaintext
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 33:181.
  ```
  - The error occurs due to an unsupported ternary operator (`? :`) in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.
- **Queries**:  
  - `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` for `T` between `1` and `5`.  
  - No results were generated due to the parsing error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**:  
  - The error points to line 33, column 181 in the code. This corresponds to the ternary operator (`? :`) in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate:
    ```prolog
    Pos is PrevPos + (G - PrevPos > 0 ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect.
    ```
  - **Issue**: ProbLog does not support ternary operators (`? :`). This is a Prolog feature not available in ProbLog's syntax.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog vs. ProbLog**:  
  - The ternary operator is valid in Prolog but unsupported in ProbLog. ProbLog restricts control constructs to maintain declarative semantics.
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**:  
  - The probabilistic rules (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and does not affect probabilistic reasoning.
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (error prevents execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly modeled but untested due to error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The ternary operator is an edge case in ProbLog syntax.  
  - Recursive termination is correct (base case `Time > 0` is enforced).  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Ternary operator (`? :`) unsupported in ProbLog | Code fails to parse | Replace with `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` or nested `if-then-else` logic. |
| 2 | ProbLog syntax restrictions | Limited control constructs | Use supported constructs (e.g., `(G - PrevPos > 0, Pos is PrevPos + Strength ; Pos is PrevPos - Strength)`). |

---

### **Recommendations**  
1. **Replace Ternary Operator**:  
   ```prolog
   attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
     Time > 0,
     Prev is Time-1,
     flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
     goal(G),
     \+ goal_reached(Prev),
     use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
     actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
     wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
     (G - PrevPos > 0 -> 
         Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect
     ; 
         Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect
     ).
   ```
2. **Verify Probabilistic Rules**:  
   - Ensure all probabilistic facts (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined.  

3. **Test After Fix**:  
   - Re-run queries to verify `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` probabilities.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
