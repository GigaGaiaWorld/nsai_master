### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under varying actuator strengths and wind conditions, with probabilistic outcomes for goal achievement and overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000          |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030          |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110          |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127          |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114          |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions remain minimal.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts and implications comply with ProbLog's requirements.  

Key predicates verified:  
- `legal_flap_position/1`  
- `actuator_strength/2`  
- `use_actuator/2`  
- `wind_effect/2`  
- `flap_position/2`  
- `overrun_exception/1`  
- `goal_reached/1`  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive termination condition is satisfied (`Time > 0` ensures termination).  
- Logical correctness is maintained, e.g., `flap_position/2` only updates if the new position is legal.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities of `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with the rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` (e.g., `wind(weak)` and `wind(strong)` sum to 1).  
  - Implications are correctly modeled (e.g., `overrun_exception/1` is triggered only when the position is illegal).  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The system correctly updates flap positions and checks for goal achievement.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities are correctly computed and propagated.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Undefined `expand/2` or non-list inputs are not relevant here.  
- Deep recursion is avoided by limiting steps (`at(5)`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured, logically sound, and correctly implements probabilistic reasoning. No issues were identified during testing or analysis.
