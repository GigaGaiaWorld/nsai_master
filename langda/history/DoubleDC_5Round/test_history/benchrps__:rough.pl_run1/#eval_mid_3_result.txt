### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the game logic for rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of a round and calculating the overall score of a game. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the game logic.  
- Analyze the test results for accuracy.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query provided is:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```  

**Test Results:**  
- The query resulted in an error:  
  ```  
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 15:63.  
  ```  

**Analysis:**  
- The error indicates that the `->` (if-then) operator is not supported in ProbLog.  
- The test failed due to the use of unsupported Prolog control constructs in ProbLog.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Query:**  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```  

**Root Cause:**  
- The `play_round/3` predicate uses the `->` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog.  
- The problematic line:  
  ```prolog
  play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Outcome) :- (beats(P1Move, P2Move) -> Outcome = win; (beats(P2Move, P1Move) -> Outcome = lose; Outcome = draw).
  ```  

**Suggested Fix:**  
Replace the `->` operator with a supported construct, such as:  
```prolog
play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Outcome) :- 
    (beats(P1Move, P2Move), Outcome = win) ; 
    (beats(P2Move, P1Move), Outcome = lose) ; 
    Outcome = draw.
```  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Context:**  
- The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are logically correct and terminate properly.  
- The issue lies in the use of unsupported control constructs (`->`) in ProbLog.  

**ProbLog Context:**  
- ProbLog does not support imperative control constructs like `->` or `!` (cut).  
- No probabilistic facts or neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used, so DeepProbLog features are not utilized.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The game logic is correct, but the outcome determination is flawed due to unsupported constructs.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The results do not comply with probabilistic rules.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `determine_winner(rock, paper, W)`).  
- Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|-----|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator | Runtime error | Replace with supported disjunction (`;`) |  
| 2   | Probabilities sum to >1.0 | Violates ProbLog rules | Ensure mutual exclusivity of outcomes |  
| 3   | Non-list inputs not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |

**Final Note:** The code requires revision to replace unsupported constructs and ensure deterministic outcomes.
