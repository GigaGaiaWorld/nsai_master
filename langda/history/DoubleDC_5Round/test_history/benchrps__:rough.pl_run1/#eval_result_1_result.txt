  "ErrorSummary": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate allows multiple outcomes to be true simultaneously, violating ProbLog's probabilistic rules (probabilities sum to >1.0). The test results show contradictory outcomes with probability 1.0 each.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the disjunctive logic in `determine_winner/3` with deterministic logic. For example, use `if-then-else` or ensure mutual exclusivity of outcomes. Example fix:\n```prolog\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, S),\n    (S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n    ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n    ; Winner = draw).\n```",
