<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under probabilistic conditions (actuator choice, wind effects) and checks for legal positions, overrun exceptions, and goal achievement. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:  

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions remain minimal.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) comply with ProbLog's syntax.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `legal_flap_position/1`  
- `actuator_strength/2`  
- `use_actuator/2`  
- `wind/1`  
- `wind_effect/2`  
- `flap_position/2`  
- `overrun_exception/1`  
- `goal_reached/1`  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `flap_position`, `overrun_exception`, and `goal_reached` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.  
- **Edge Cases:** The system handles edge cases such as illegal flap positions (`\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`) and ensures termination within the first five steps (`at(5)`).  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with the rules `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` and `P(A ⇒ B) = P(¬A) + P(A ∧ B)`.  
- **Negation:** The negation-as-failure (`\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`) is correctly used in the `overrun_exception` rule.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The system correctly models the flap movement and checks for legal positions and exceptions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined and evaluated.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

**Edge Cases and Performance:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are present.  
- **Non-list Input:** The system does not handle list inputs, but this is irrelevant to the problem.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to five steps, ensuring performance is not an issue.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured, logically correct, and adheres to ProbLog's probabilistic rules. No errors or improvements are identified.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of the ProbLog code, ensuring its correctness and compliance with the specified requirements.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
