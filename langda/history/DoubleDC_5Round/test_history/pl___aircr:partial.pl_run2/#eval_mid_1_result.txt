### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under probabilistic conditions (actuator choice, wind effects) and checks for legal positions, overrun exceptions, and goal achievement. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:  

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions remain minimal.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) comply with ProbLog's syntax.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `legal_flap_position/1`  
- `actuator_strength/2`  
- `use_actuator/2`  
- `wind/1`  
- `wind_effect/2`  
- `flap_position/2`  
- `overrun_exception/1`  
- `goal_reached/1`

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `flap_position`, `overrun_exception`, and `goal_reached` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.  
- **Edge Cases:** The system handles edge cases such as illegal flap positions (`\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`) and ensures termination within the first five steps (`at(5)`).  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with the rules `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` and `P(A ⇒ B) = P(¬A) + P(A ∧ B)`.  
- **Negation:** The negation-as-failure (`\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`) is correctly used in the `overrun_exception` rule.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The system correctly models the flap movement and checks for legal positions and exceptions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined and evaluated.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

**Edge Cases and Performance:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are present.  
- **Non-list Input:** The system does not handle list inputs, but this is irrelevant to the problem.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to five steps, ensuring performance is not an issue.
