</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort Algorithm**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to verify its correctness, interpretability, and compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules. The evaluation focuses on:  
- Classical Prolog correctness (logical soundness, termination).  
- ProbLog-specific features (probabilistic facts, implications).  
- Edge cases and performance considerations.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query and Result:**  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Output:**  
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0, confirming deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `insertion_sort/2`, `insertion_sort/3`, and `insert/3` are logically sound and terminate correctly for all valid inputs.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The base case (`insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc)`) and recursive case (`insertion_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted)`) are correctly defined.  
  - The `insert/3` predicate handles element placement in the accumulator list with proper comparisons (`X =< Y` and `X > Y`).  

- **Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the list is progressively reduced (`[H|T]` to `T`), and the accumulator grows until the input list is empty.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The program does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P::fact`). Thus, no probabilistic implications or negations are involved.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not used.** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) or probabilistic fusion are present.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Status       | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | ✅ Met       | Correctly implements insertion sort in Prolog.                              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | ❌ Not Met | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Integration   | ❌ Not Met | No DeepProbLog features are utilized.                                       |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The program assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) will fail.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may cause stack overflow (typical Prolog limitation).  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No auxiliary predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are used or required.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| #  | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                          |
|----|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1  | No probabilistic features | Limited to classical use | Add probabilistic facts if needed.  |
| 2  | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural reasoning  | Use `nn/3` for hybrid reasoning.    |
| 3  | Non-list input handling  | Runtime failure      | Add input validation.               |

---

**Word Count:** 450  

**Final Notes:**  
The code is correct for classical Prolog but lacks ProbLog-specific features. Enhancements could include probabilistic sorting (e.g., uncertain comparisons) or neural network integration for hybrid reasoning. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
