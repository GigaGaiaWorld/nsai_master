### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort Algorithm**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to verify its correctness, interpretability, and compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules. The evaluation focuses on:  
- Classical Prolog correctness (logical soundness, termination).  
- ProbLog-specific features (probabilistic facts, implications).  
- Edge cases and performance considerations.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query and Result:**  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Output:**  
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0, confirming deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `insertion_sort/2`, `insertion_sort/3`, and `insert/3` are logically sound and terminate correctly for all valid inputs.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The base case (`insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc)`) and recursive case (`insertion_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted)`) are correctly defined.  
  - The `insert/3` predicate handles element placement in the accumulator list with proper comparisons (`X =< Y` and `X > Y`).  

- **Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the list is progressively reduced (`[H|T]` to `T`), and the accumulator grows until the input list is empty.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The program does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P::fact`). Thus, no probabilistic implications or negations are involved.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not used.** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) or probabilistic fusion are present.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Status       | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | ✅ Met       | Correctly implements insertion sort in Prolog.                              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | ❌ Not Met | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Integration   | ❌ Not Met | No DeepProbLog features are utilized.                                       |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The program assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) will fail.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may cause stack overflow (typical Prolog limitation).  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No auxiliary predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are used or required.

|----|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1  | No probabilistic features | Limited to classical use | Add probabilistic facts if needed.  |
| 2  | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural reasoning  | Use `nn/3` for hybrid reasoning.    |
| 3  | Non-list input handling  | Runtime failure      | Add input validation.               |

**Final Notes:**  
The code is correct for classical Prolog but lacks ProbLog-specific features. Enhancements could include probabilistic sorting (e.g., uncertain comparisons) or neural network integration for hybrid reasoning. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
