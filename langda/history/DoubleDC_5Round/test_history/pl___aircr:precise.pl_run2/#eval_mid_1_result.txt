### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates flap movement under probabilistic actuator selection and wind interference. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 steps. This report evaluates the code's correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time due to wind interference and actuator variability.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:  
- `legal_flap_position/1` (line 2).  
- `actuator_strength/2` (lines 4–5).  
- `use_actuator/2` (line 7).  
- `wind_effect/2` (lines 10–11).  
- `flap_position/2` and `overrun_exception/1` (lines 14–21).  
- `goal_reached/1` (lines 23–25).

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The code adheres to Prolog's declarative semantics. Recursion terminates correctly (e.g., `Time > 0` ensures termination).  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2` or non-list inputs are not applicable here.  
  - The system handles illegal flap positions via `overrun_exception/1`.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is respected (e.g., `wind_effect` probabilities sum to 1).  
  - `P(A⇒B)` is implicitly handled via negation (`\+ legal_flap_position`).  
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Correctly models flap movement and goal checking.                           |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met      | Accurately simulates actuator selection and wind effects.                   |
| Neural Network Integration | N/A    | No DeepProbLog features used.                                               |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Positions**: Handled by `overrun_exception/1`.  
- **Performance**: Recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.
