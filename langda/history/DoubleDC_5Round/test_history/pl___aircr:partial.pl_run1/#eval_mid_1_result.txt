#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller: Test Results, Failure Localization, and Root Cause Analysis**

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates flap movement under probabilistic actuator and wind conditions, with the goal of moving the flap from position 6 to 4. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the test results.  
- Identify any failures in the logic or probabilistic reasoning.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and probabilistic rules.  
- Confirm the absence of DeepProbLog features (if applicable).

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000          |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030          |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110          |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127          |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114          |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system under probabilistic actuator and wind conditions.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:  
- **`flap_position/2` (Line 10-12):** Correctly moves the flap if the attempted position is legal.  
- **`overrun_exception/1` (Line 15-17):** Correctly triggers an exception for illegal positions.  
- **`goal_reached/1` (Line 20-22):** Accurately checks if the flap reaches the goal position.  
- **`attempted_flap_position/2` (Line 25-34):** Computes the new position based on actuator strength and wind effect.  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `legal_flap_position/1`, `actuator_strength/2`) are correctly defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for flap movement and exception handling are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.  
- **Edge Cases:** The system handles edge cases such as illegal positions (`overrun_exception`) and goal verification (`goal_reached`).  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `use_actuator/2` and `wind_effect/2` comply with ProbLog rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- **Negation/Implication:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly implemented.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status   | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met      | The logic for flap movement and exception handling is correct.              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met   | Probabilities for actuators and wind effects are correctly modeled.         |
| Neural Network Integration | N/A  | No DeepProbLog features are used.                                           |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input:** The input is strictly numerical (positions and time steps).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), ensuring performance.
