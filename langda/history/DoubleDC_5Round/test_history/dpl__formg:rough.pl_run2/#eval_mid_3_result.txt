### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Merge Sort in ProbLog: Correctness and Edge Cases**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to verify its correctness, analyze its behavior in classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
- **Result**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The query successfully sorts the input list with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**. The implementation adheres to the expected behavior for the given test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates**: The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`), so no verification is required for them.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
##### **Classical Prolog Context**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` are logically correct. The recursion terminates as the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are properly defined.  
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion depth is controlled by splitting the list into halves, ensuring termination.  

##### **ProbLog Context**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or uncertainties are involved in this query.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**: The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in Prolog.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this case, as the test result is deterministic.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.  
- **Single-element List**: Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([X], [X])`.  
- **Performance**: The algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), but deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|--------|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |  
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Potential stack overflow | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |  

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog semantics. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and could benefit from optimizations for large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
