### **Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition ProbLog Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptarithmetic puzzle where the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` must hold true, with each letter representing a unique digit (0-9) and the first digit of any multi-digit number being non-zero. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided are as follows:
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). Each query returns a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the solutions satisfy all constraints (unique digits, non-zero leading digits, and correct arithmetic).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:
- **`leftdigit/1`**: Ensures non-zero leading digits (lines 1-5).
- **`sumdigit/5`**: Correctly simulates column addition with carry (lines 6-10).
- **`all_different/1`**: Ensures uniqueness of digits (lines 11-14).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code adheres to Prolog's declarative semantics. Recursive predicates like `all_different/1` terminate correctly.
- **Arithmetic Constraints**: The `sumdigit/5` predicate handles carry propagation and digit constraints accurately.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The code does not use probabilistic facts (`p::`). All constraints are deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used. The problem is purely symbolic.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle using deterministic Prolog rules.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.
- **Non-list Input**: The input is always a list of digits, as enforced by the query.
- **Performance**: The recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code is logically sound, passes all tests, and adheres to ProbLog's deterministic subset. No issues were identified. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic constraints or neural network integration if the problem scope expands.
