  "HASH": "5E40E418",
  "ErrorSummary": "1. Non-list input handling not addressed. 2. Empty stack edge cases not handled. 3. Performance of insertion_sort/2 could be improved for larger stacks.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for stack operations to ensure the stack is a list. 2. Add explicit checks for empty stacks in operations like pop, swap, and rot. 3. Replace insertion_sort/2 with a more efficient sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort) for better scalability.",
