### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 1, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of each stack operation.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are logically sound. For example, `stack_op(pop, [X | Stack], Stack)` correctly removes the top element.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate terminates because the base case (`insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc)`) is always reached after processing all elements of the input list.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations are correctly implemented and tested.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers) would cause errors.  
- **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `swap`, and `rot` require a non-empty stack. Edge cases for empty stacks are not explicitly handled.  
- **Performance:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate may suffer from performance issues for large lists due to its quadratic complexity.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling | Runtime errors | Add input validation for stack operations. |
| 2   | Empty stack edge cases | Undefined behavior | Explicitly handle empty stacks for operations like `pop`, `swap`, and `rot`. |
| 3   | Performance of `insertion_sort/2` | Scalability issues | Replace with a more efficient sorting algorithm for larger stacks. |

**Word Count:** 450 words  

**Final Verdict:** The implementation meets the classical reasoning requirements but lacks edge-case handling and probabilistic features. No failures were detected in the provided test cases.
