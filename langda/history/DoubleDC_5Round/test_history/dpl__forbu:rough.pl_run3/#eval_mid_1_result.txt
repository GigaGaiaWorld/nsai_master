### Code Evaluation Report: Bubblesort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, which is a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes with the expected output. The probability of the result is `1.0000`, indicating deterministic correctness.

**Conclusion**:  
All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list as expected.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/4` function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Context**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively sorts the list by repeatedly applying the `bubble/4` predicate, which moves the largest element to the end of the list. The logic is sound, and the recursion terminates when the list is empty.
  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion terminates because the list is reduced in size with each recursive call (`bubblesort(NT, [Max|Acc], Sorted)`), ensuring eventual termination.

##### **ProbLog Context**  
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules**:  
  The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. It operates purely in a deterministic context.  
  - No probabilistic facts (`0.5::fact.`) or rules (`P::head :- body.`) are present.  
  - No implications or negations are used, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` are irrelevant here.

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  The implementation meets the requirement of classical reasoning. The `bubblesort/3` algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic features.  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  Not applicable, as DeepProbLog features are not used.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  
- **Performance**:  
  The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, `implies/2`, etc.) are used, so this is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog features not used | Limited to classical reasoning | Consider extending for probabilistic use cases if needed. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and meets the classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. Enhancements could include input validation and optional probabilistic extensions.
