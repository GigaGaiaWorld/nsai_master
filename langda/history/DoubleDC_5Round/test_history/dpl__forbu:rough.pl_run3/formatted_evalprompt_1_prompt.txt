</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Bubblesort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, which is a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes with the expected output. The probability of the result is `1.0000`, indicating deterministic correctness.

**Conclusion**:  
All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list as expected.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/4` function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Context**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively sorts the list by repeatedly applying the `bubble/4` predicate, which moves the largest element to the end of the list. The logic is sound, and the recursion terminates when the list is empty.
  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion terminates because the list is reduced in size with each recursive call (`bubblesort(NT, [Max|Acc], Sorted)`), ensuring eventual termination.

##### **ProbLog Context**  
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules**:  
  The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. It operates purely in a deterministic context.  
  - No probabilistic facts (`0.5::fact.`) or rules (`P::head :- body.`) are present.  
  - No implications or negations are used, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` are irrelevant here.

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  The implementation meets the requirement of classical reasoning. The `bubblesort/3` algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic features.  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  Not applicable, as DeepProbLog features are not used.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  
- **Performance**:  
  The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, `implies/2`, etc.) are used, so this is not a concern.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog features not used | Limited to classical reasoning | Consider extending for probabilistic use cases if needed. |

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and meets the classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. Enhancements could include input validation and optional probabilistic extensions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
