### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating probabilistic actuator selection and wind effects to determine flap positions. The evaluation aims to:  
- Verify test results for correctness.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and logical constraints.  
- Identify edge cases and potential improvements.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Queries and Results**:  
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`  
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`  
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`  
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`  
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`  
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`  
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`  
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`  
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`  
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`  

- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilistic behavior of the system.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**: The code executes as intended, and all queries return valid probabilistic results.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `legal_flap_position/1`, `actuator_strength/2`, `use_actuator/2`, `wind_effect/2`, `flap_position/2`, `overrun_exception/1`, `goal_reached/1`.  
  - No unsupported constructs (e.g., `->/2`) are present.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive logic in `attempted_flap_position/2` correctly updates the flap position based on actuator strength and wind effects.  
  - Termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and decrementing `Time`.  

- **Probabilistic Compliance**:  
  - Probabilities for `use_actuator/2` and `wind_effect/2` adhere to ProbLog rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`).  
  - Negation (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) is correctly handled.  

- **DeepProbLog**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met (logical rules are sound).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Fully met (probabilities are correctly computed).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not used.  
  - **Non-list Inputs**: Not applicable.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: No performance issues detected (limited to 5 steps).

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|---|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |  

---

#### **8. Corrected Code (N/A)**  
No corrections needed. The original code is correct and passes all tests.  

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The aircraft flap controller model is logically and probabilistically sound. All test results are valid, and no edge cases were overlooked. For future work, consider extending the model to include more complex wind effects or actuator behaviors.
