### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic (as expected).
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules adhere to the problem's requirements:
- **`open_door/1` Rules:**
  - Correctly handles cases where both unselected doors are empty (random selection).
  - Correctly handles cases where one unselected door has a prize (host opens the empty door).
- **`win_keep` and `win_switch`:**
  - Accurately reflect the winning conditions for both strategies.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- Logical correctness is ensured:
  - Recursive predicates (e.g., `member/2`) terminate correctly.
  - Negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used appropriately.
- No undefined predicates or edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs) are present.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- Probabilities comply with rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled by `\+ prize(A)`.
  - Disjunctive probabilities (e.g., `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`) are correctly modeled.
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `prize/1`, `open_door/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs.
- Recursive performance is efficient (small problem size).

|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |
