### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Number Detection and Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to:  
- Detect numbers from images (e.g., `detect_number(image_0, 0)`).  
- Detect arithmetic operators (e.g., `detect_operator(image_plus, +)`).  
- Parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions (e.g., `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`).  

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
1. Verify the correctness of the code and its test results.  
2. Analyze logical and probabilistic correctness.  
3. Check for edge cases and potential improvements.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```  
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], -10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification**:  
  The result matches the expected calculation:  
  `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7 = -10.333...`.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- All predicates (`detect_number`, `detect_operator`, `detect_all`, `parse`) function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive predicate `detect_all` correctly processes lists of numbers and operators.  
  - The `parse` predicate handles arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) accurately.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion in `detect_all` and `parse` terminates correctly for valid inputs.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)`).  
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - No neural predicates (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement            | Status       | Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning    | Met          | The code correctly parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.             |
| Probabilistic Reasoning| Not Applicable| No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used  | No DeepProbLog features are utilized.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**:  
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs or malformed expressions (e.g., `[image_2, image_plus]`).  
- **Division by Zero**:  
  - The `parse` predicate checks for division by zero (`N2 \== 0`), which is correct.  
- **Deep Recursion**:  
  - Performance may degrade for very long lists due to recursive calls.

| No. | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list Input Handling  | Potential runtime error | Add input validation for lists.            |
| 2   | Deep Recursion           | Performance issues   | Optimize or limit recursion depth.          |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog Features  | Limited functionality | Consider integrating neural predicates.    |

### **Final Remarks**  
The code meets classical reasoning requirements but lacks probabilistic and neural network features. Edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness.
