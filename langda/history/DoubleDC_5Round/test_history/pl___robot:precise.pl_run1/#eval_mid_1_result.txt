### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a robot's behavior in a dynamic environment where it can pick up, carry, or drop a key. The scenario includes probabilistic events such as successful/failed movements, slippery keys, and fumbling. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the code against the given test results.  
- Analyze logical and probabilistic consistency.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.4331  
- `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.9000  
- `at(robot, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0900  
- `at(robot, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0100  
- `at(key, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.5670  
- `at(key, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.4330  
- `at(key, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0000  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key dynamics, including probabilistic outcomes.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts adhere to the expected behavior.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Logical Correctness**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
  - The recursive predicates (e.g., `carrying/2`, `at/3`) terminate correctly due to the base case and time increment (`s(T)`).  
  - Negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used appropriately to model absence of actions (e.g., `\+ do(putdown(key), T)`).  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - Probabilities are correctly computed (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`).  
  - The rules for `drops/2` and `slippery/2` comply with probabilistic implications (e.g., `P(A ⇒ B) = P(¬A) + P(A ∧ B)`).  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key dynamics.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. Probabilities are computed accurately, and the rules align with ProbLog semantics.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are called.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable (no list operations).  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable due to the time increment (`s(T)`).
