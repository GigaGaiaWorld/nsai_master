### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller: Error Diagnosis and Recommendations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates flap movements under probabilistic wind effects and actuator choices. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 steps. The code includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and legal flap positions. However, the test results indicate a parsing error related to a missing binary operator.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Error Encountered**:  
  ```plaintext
  ParseError: Expected binary operator at 33:204.
  ```
- **Queries**:  
  - `goal_reached(T)` for `T` between 1 and 5.  
  - `overrun_exception(T)` for `T` between 1 and 5.  
- **Results**:  
  - No queries could be executed due to the parsing error.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**:  
  The error occurs in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate, specifically in the ternary conditional expression:  
  ```prolog
  Pos is PrevPos + (Target - PrevPos > 0 ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect.
  ```
  - **Issue**: ProbLog does not support ternary operators (`? :`).  
  - **Line**: The error points to line 33, column 204.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The ternary operator is invalid in ProbLog. The logic should be rewritten using Prolog's `if-then-else` or arithmetic comparisons.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The probabilistic rules (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are syntactically correct but cannot be evaluated due to the parsing error.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (except for the ternary operator issue).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly modeled but untested due to the error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2` or similar predicates are not present.  
  - Non-list inputs are not a concern here.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Ternary operator unsupported     | Code fails to parse             | Replace with `(Target - PrevPos > 0 -> Strength ; -Strength)` or arithmetic. |
| 2   | Probabilistic rules untested     | Functionality unverified        | Fix syntax and re-run tests.                                               |

---

### **Recommendations**  
1. **Rewrite the Ternary Operator**:  
   Replace:  
   ```prolog
   Pos is PrevPos + (Target - PrevPos > 0 ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect.
   ```  
   With:  
   ```prolog
   (Target - PrevPos > 0 -> Delta is Strength ; Delta is -Strength),
   Pos is PrevPos + Delta + WindEffect.
   ```  

2. **Re-run Tests**:  
   After fixing the syntax, verify the probabilistic behavior of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception`.  

3. **Edge Case Testing**:  
   Test with extreme wind effects (e.g., `WindEffect = 3`) to ensure no overrun occurs unexpectedly.
