### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Identify and analyze any errors or failures.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of the `member/2` predicate in the ProbLog environment. The error message is:
```prolog
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```
This suggests that the predicate `member/2` is not natively supported in ProbLog or is incorrectly defined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The entire `zebra/1` predicate fails because it relies on `member/2`.
- **Error Location**: Line 4 of the code, where `member/2` is first used.
- **Root Cause**: ProbLog does not support the `member/2` predicate as it is not part of its standard library or built-in predicates.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic of the puzzle is sound, but the implementation fails due to the unsupported `member/2` predicate.
- **Probabilistic Context**: The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so this aspect is not relevant here.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, and `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and should terminate properly.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The puzzle's logical constraints are correctly modeled, but the unsupported `member/2` predicate prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this context.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The absence of `member/2` is a critical oversight.
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not tested but could be problematic if not handled.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `member/2` not supported    | Entire puzzle cannot be solved  | Replace `member/2` with a custom implementation or use ProbLog's `lists` module if available. |
| 2   | No DeepProbLog features     | N/A                             | Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."     |

---

### **Recommendations**
1. **Replace `member/2`**:
   - Define a custom `member/2` predicate in ProbLog or use an alternative supported by ProbLog's `lists` module.
   ```prolog
   member(X, [X|_]).
   member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
   ```
2. **Verify Predicate Support**:
   - Ensure all predicates used are supported in ProbLog by consulting the official documentation.
