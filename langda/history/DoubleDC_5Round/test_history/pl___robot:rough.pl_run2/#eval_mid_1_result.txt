### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` = 0.8743  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` = 0.9000  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0900  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0100  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` = 0.8559  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` = 0.1324  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0117  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the probabilistic rules and actions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (e.g., `slippery(key,0)`).  
- **Negation-as-Failure:** The use of `\+` (negation) in predicates like `drops(key,T)` adheres to Prolog semantics.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `goto_succeeds/1` comply with ProbLog rules.  
- **Negation and Implications:** The probabilities for negated events (e.g., `\+ drops(key,T)`) are correctly computed as `1 - P(drops(key,T))`.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic rules and facts are correctly implemented.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are called.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable (no list operations).  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable (e.g., `s(s(s(0)))`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**  
The ProbLog code is well-structured and correctly implements the specified requirements. All test cases pass, and the probabilistic reasoning adheres to ProbLog's rules. No issues were identified during the evaluation.
