### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Density Calculation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Population Density Comparison**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code calculates the population density of countries and identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The functional requirements include:  
- Classical reasoning for density calculation.  
- Probabilistic reasoning (though not explicitly used here).  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., neural network integration).  

The code uses deterministic arithmetic operations to compute densities and compare them.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results show the following successful queries:  
1. `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
2. `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
3. `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
4. `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected output, confirming the correctness of the density calculation and comparison logic.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `density/2` and `query_pop/1` are correctly implemented, and the arithmetic operations (`is`, `>`, `<`) comply with ProbLog's deterministic requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Correctness:**  
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly computes density as `(P*100)//A`.  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures `D1 > D2` and checks the 20:21 ratio constraint.  
  - No recursive termination issues (no recursion used).  

- **ProbLog Compliance:**  
  - The code uses deterministic arithmetic (`is`, `>`, `<`), which is fully supported in ProbLog.  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used, so no need to verify `P(¬A)` or `P(A⇒B)`.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements Met:**  
  - Classical reasoning: Fully met.  
  - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - Neural network integration: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes all `pop/2` and `area/2` facts are defined. Missing facts would lead to silent failures.  
  - **Non-list Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list; non-list inputs would fail.  
  - **Performance:** The current implementation is efficient for the given dataset but may scale poorly for larger datasets due to the quadratic comparison (`O(n^2)`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing input validation | Silent failures for undefined countries | Add checks for `pop/2` and `area/2` facts. |
| 2   | Non-list input handling | Predicate fails for malformed inputs | Validate input format in `query_pop/1`. |
| 3   | Scalability | Quadratic complexity for large datasets | Optimize with indexing or filtering. |
