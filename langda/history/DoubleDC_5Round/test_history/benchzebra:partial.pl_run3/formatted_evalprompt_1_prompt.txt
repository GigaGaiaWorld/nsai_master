<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation by analyzing the test results and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result shows the following output:  
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```  
- **All tests passed (no failures)**: The output satisfies all the given constraints (e.g., the owner of the red house is English, the Spanish has a dog, etc.). The probability of 1.0000 indicates certainty in the solution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules (e.g., `my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are correctly implemented and align with the requirements.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The code adheres to the puzzle's constraints. For example:  
  - `my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)` ensures the English own the red house.  
  - `right_of(house(green,_,_,_,_), house(ivory,_,_,_,_), Houses)` correctly enforces the green house being to the right of the ivory house.  
- **Recursive Termination**: Recursive predicates like `right_of` and `next_to` terminate correctly due to the base cases and proper list traversal.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not relevant here.  
- **Non-list Input**: The `houses` predicate ensures the input is a list of five houses.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is fixed (five houses), so performance is not an issue.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle is correct and meets all specified requirements. The test results confirm the solution's validity, and no edge cases or failures were identified. The code is well-structured and adheres to ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
</Final_Answer>
