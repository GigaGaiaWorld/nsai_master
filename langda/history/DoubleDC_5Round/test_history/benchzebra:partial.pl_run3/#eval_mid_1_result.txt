### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation by analyzing the test results and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result shows the following output:  
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```  
- **All tests passed (no failures)**: The output satisfies all the given constraints (e.g., the owner of the red house is English, the Spanish has a dog, etc.). The probability of 1.0000 indicates certainty in the solution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules (e.g., `my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are correctly implemented and align with the requirements.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The code adheres to the puzzle's constraints. For example:  
  - `my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)` ensures the English own the red house.  
  - `right_of(house(green,_,_,_,_), house(ivory,_,_,_,_), Houses)` correctly enforces the green house being to the right of the ivory house.  
- **Recursive Termination**: Recursive predicates like `right_of` and `next_to` terminate correctly due to the base cases and proper list traversal.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not relevant here.  
- **Non-list Input**: The `houses` predicate ensures the input is a list of five houses.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is fixed (five houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

### **Conclusion**  
The ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle is correct and meets all specified requirements. The test results confirm the solution's validity, and no edge cases or failures were identified. The code is well-structured and adheres to ProbLog's syntax and semantics.
