### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a robot's actions (e.g., `goto`, `pickup`, `putdown`) and probabilistic outcomes (e.g., `pickup_succeeds`, `drops`). The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the code and its test results, focusing on classical and probabilistic reasoning, as well as edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the predicates and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic outcomes comply with the given probabilities (e.g., `0.9::goto_succeeds(T)`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `carrying/2` and `at/3` predicates correctly model the robot's actions and key movements.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base case (`s(0)`) and the use of `s(T)` for time steps.  

- **Negation-as-Failure (`\+`):**  
  - Used correctly to handle cases like `\+ do(putdown(key),T)` and `\+ slippery(key,T)`.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds`, `drop_slippery_key`, and `fumbles_key` comply with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
  - Example: `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.3::pickup_fails(T)` correctly sums to 1.  

- **Negation and Implications:**  
  - No violations of probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`).  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Predicates correctly model robot actions and key movements.                 |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met      | Probabilities and negation comply with ProbLog rules.                       |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable (limited to `s(s(s(0)))`).
