### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules.
- Verification of test results.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- Logical correctness is ensured by:
  - Proper use of `member/2` for door selection.
  - Correct negation (`\+`) to exclude invalid doors.
- Recursive termination is guaranteed as `member/2` operates on finite lists.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- Probabilities comply with rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled by `\+`.
  - The disjunction (`;`) in `open_door/1` correctly models random selection.
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `member/2`, negation).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., uniform distribution for `prize/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not relevant here.
- **Non-list Input:** Guarded by `member/2`.
- **Deep Recursion:** Not an issue due to small input size.
