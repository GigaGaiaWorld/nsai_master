### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to classical and probabilistic reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the specified functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query and result:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability of correctness is 1.0000, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` function as intended.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Recursively sorts the tail list and inserts the head element.  
- `insert_element/3`: Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

**Line Numbers:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Lines 1–3  
- `insert_element/3`: Lines 4–8  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation adheres to the insertion sort algorithm. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or uncertainties are involved in this deterministic scenario.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...`, or related calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements insertion sort.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance may degrade with very long lists due to recursive calls.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Performance bottleneck     | Consider iterative optimization.    |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Verdict:**  
The code is functionally correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog rules. However, improvements can be made to handle edge cases and optimize performance. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.

**Code Block for Reference:**
```prolog
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).

insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
    X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
    X > H,
    insert_element(X, T, RT).
