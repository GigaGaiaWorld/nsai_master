### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Population Density Query**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population density. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division, adhering to the requirement of approximating `D1/D2 < 1.05` using the inequality `20 × D1 < 21 × D2`. The code includes predicates for calculating population density and a query predicate to identify matching country pairs.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided show the following queries and their probabilities:
```prolog
query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000
query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population density, as per the specified inequality.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** All queries returned the expected results with a probability of `1.0000`, indicating successful execution.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `density/2`: Correctly calculates population density using integer arithmetic.
  - `query_pop/1`: Correctly filters pairs of countries based on the given inequality.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `density/2` predicate accurately computes the population density using floor division, as required.
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that pairs of countries are distinct (`C1 \= C2`) and satisfy the inequality `20 × D1 < 21 × D2` (and its symmetric counterpart).
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning checks are needed.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the required logic for querying and filtering country pairs.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`, `query_pop/1`) are defined and correctly implemented.
  - **Non-list Input:** The query assumes a list input format `[C1, D1, C2, D2]`. No edge cases for invalid input formats were tested, but the code is robust for the given use case.
  - **Performance:** The code does not involve recursion or complex computations, so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**
The ProbLog code successfully meets the specified requirements for querying countries with approximately equal population density. The test results confirm its correctness, and no edge cases or failures were identified. The code is concise, efficient, and adheres to the constraints provided. No further modifications are necessary.
