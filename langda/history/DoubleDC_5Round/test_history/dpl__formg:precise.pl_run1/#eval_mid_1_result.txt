### **Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.
- Analyze edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:**  
  The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.

**All tests passed (no failures).**  
The implementation correctly handles the input list and produces the expected sorted output.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The code adheres to the merge sort algorithm's logic:
  1. **Base Cases:**  
     - `merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])` correctly handle empty and single-element lists.
  2. **Recursive Splitting:**  
     - The `split_list` predicate divides the list into two halves (`Left` and `Right`).
  3. **Recursive Sorting and Merging:**  
     - The `merge_sort` predicate recursively sorts the sublists and merges them using the `merge` predicate.

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates correctly when the list length is 0 or 1, ensuring no infinite loops.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules:**  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required. The result probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic behavior.

- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  Fully met. The implementation correctly performs merge sort in a deterministic Prolog context.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules used).
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases**
1. **Non-List Input:**  
   The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
2. **Performance for Large Lists:**  
   The recursive splitting and merging may face performance issues for very large lists due to stack usage.
3. **Empty List:**  
   Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation for list type. |
| 2      | Performance for large lists | Potential stack overflow | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The merge sort implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical Prolog logic. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
