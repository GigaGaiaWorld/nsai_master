### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Image-Based Number and Operator Detection**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect numbers and operators from images and perform arithmetic operations. The goal is to evaluate the logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and edge-case handling of the implementation.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], -10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes with the correct result (`-10.333333333333332`).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  - The code does not use expansion predicates like `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, or `expand/2`.  
  - No classical or probabilistic contexts require additional verification.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The predicates `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` are correctly defined.  
  - The recursive predicate `detect_all/2` successfully parses lists of numbers and operators.  
  - The `parse/2` predicate handles arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and termination conditions (`[N]`).  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion in `detect_all/2` and `parse/2` terminates correctly for valid inputs.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`).  
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present.  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement            | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning    | Met         | The code correctly parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.             |
| Probabilistic Reasoning| Not Used    | No probabilistic facts or rules are employed.                               |
| Neural Network Fusion  | Not Used    | No DeepProbLog features are utilized.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**:  
  - Non-list inputs to `detect_all/2` or `parse/2` are not handled.  
  - Division by zero (`N2 \== 0`) is checked, but other edge cases (e.g., invalid operators) are not.  
- **Performance**:  
  - Deep recursion for long lists may impact performance.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic rules   | Limited functionality      | Add probabilistic facts if needed.  |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features  | No neural integration      | Use `nn/3` for advanced tasks.      |
| 3      | Edge cases unhandled     | Potential runtime errors   | Validate inputs and operators.      |

### **Final Remarks**  
The code meets classical reasoning requirements but lacks probabilistic and neural network features. Edge-case handling and input validation could be improved for robustness. No failures were detected in the provided test case.
