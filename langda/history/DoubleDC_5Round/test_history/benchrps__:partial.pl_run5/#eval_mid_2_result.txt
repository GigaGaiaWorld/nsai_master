### **Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the rules, game logic, and test results. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, recursive termination, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. Player 2 wins because:
  - `paper` beats `rock` (twice).
  - `scissor` loses to `rock` (once).
  - Net score: `-1` (Player 2 wins).

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The following predicates were verified:
- `move/1`: Correctly defines gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
- `beats/2`: Correctly encodes win-lose relationships.
- `result/3`: Handles `draw`, `win`, and `lose` cases.
- `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Recursively process moves and scores.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Correctness**:  
  - Logical rules are sound (e.g., `beats(paper, rock)` is correct).
  - Recursive termination is ensured for `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used (pure classical Prolog).
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are **not used**.
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms) are not handled but are irrelevant here.
  - Deep recursion is avoided due to fixed-length move lists.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met (rules and results are correct).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined gestures (e.g., `move(lizard)`) are not handled.
  - Empty move lists are correctly processed (`play([], [], [])`).
