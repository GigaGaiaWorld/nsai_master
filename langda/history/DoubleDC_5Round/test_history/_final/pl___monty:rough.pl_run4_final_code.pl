The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes model the Monty Hall problem accurately, with the same probability distributions for prize locations, door selection, and outcomes for keeping or switching doors. The generated code simplifies the open_door rule while maintaining the same logical structure and probabilistic behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence.
