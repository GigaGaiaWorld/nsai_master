### **Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under probabilistic actuator and wind conditions, aiming to reach a goal position while avoiding overrun exceptions. This report evaluates the code's correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  

| Query                | Probability Result |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions remain minimal.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules function as intended:  
- **`goal_reached/1`** correctly checks if the flap position matches the goal.  
- **`overrun_exception/1`** accurately identifies illegal flap positions.  
- The probabilistic rules for actuator selection (`use_actuator/2`) and wind effects (`wind_effect/2`) comply with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures no unnecessary calculations once the goal is reached.  
  - The arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., `sign(GP - Old) * AS`) are correctly implemented.  

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The probabilities for actuator selection (`0.5::use_actuator(T,a); 0.5::use_actuator(T,b)`) and wind effects (`0.7::wind(weak); 0.3::wind(strong)`) adhere to ProbLog's rules.  
  - Negation (`\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`) is handled correctly, with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The logic for flap movement and goal checking is sound.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** None detected.  
  - **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
  - **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.
