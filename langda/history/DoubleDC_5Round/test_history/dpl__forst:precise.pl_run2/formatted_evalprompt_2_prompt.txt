</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations: Functional and Probabilistic Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a stack data structure in ProbLog, supporting operations like `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and a custom `sort` operation. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the stack operations.  
- Analyze the probabilistic and classical logical aspects.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's constraints and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and all returned the expected results with a probability of `1.0000`:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [3, 1, 2, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align perfectly with the requirements for each operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** Each predicate adheres to the stack operation definitions. For example:  
  - `push(X, Stack, [X|Stack])` correctly prepends `X` to the stack.  
  - `sort` uses `get_top_n` to isolate the top 3 elements, sorts them, and appends them back.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used, so termination is not an issue.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. All operations are deterministic (probability `1.0000`).  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All stack operations behave as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) would fail.  
- **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, etc., require a non-empty stack. No handling for empty stacks is provided.  
- **Performance:** The `sort` operation uses `append`, which could be inefficient for large stacks.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | No handling for empty stacks | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add guards (e.g., `Stack \= []`). |
| 2   | Non-list inputs cause failures | Unpredictable behavior | Validate input type. |
| 3   | `sort` inefficiency for large stacks | Performance degradation | Optimize or limit `sort` to small stacks. |

---

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Verdict:** The code is functionally correct but lacks robustness for edge cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
