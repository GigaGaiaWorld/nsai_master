</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Example**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Recursive Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a recursive coin-tossing scenario where the success count (`SC`) increments if a coin lands heads (`coin(CNT)`). The counter (`CNT`) decrements recursively until it reaches zero. The test results show the probabilities of different success counts (`total(S)`). This report evaluates the code's correctness, identifies potential issues, and ensures compliance with ProbLog's syntax and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Queries and Results:**  
  ```plaintext
  total(4) = 0.4096
  total(3) = 0.8192
  total(2) = 0.9728
  total(1) = 0.9984
  total(0) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities for a binomial distribution with `P(heads) = 0.8` and `CNT = 4`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `coin/1`: Correctly defines a probabilistic fact with `P(heads) = 0.8`.  
  - `coins_r/3`: Recursively updates `SC` and `CNT` without unsupported constructs (e.g., `->/2`).  
  - `total/1`: Initializes `SC = 0` and calls `coins_r/3` with `CNT = 4`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT = 0`.  
  - The disjunction (`;`) and conjunction (`,`) in `coins_r/3` ensure compatibility with ProbLog's declarative semantics.  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The probability of `coin(CNT)` being true (`0.8`) is correctly propagated through recursive calls.  
  - No negation or implication rules are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (recursive logic is sound).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (probabilities computed correctly).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Negative `CNT`:** Unchecked (could lead to non-termination).  
  - **Unsupported Syntax:** None detected.  
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion may impact performance for large `CNT`.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unchecked negative `CNT` | Non-termination risk | Add guard `CNT >= 0` in `coins_r/3`. |
| 2 | Deep recursion | Performance overhead | Consider iterative solutions for large `CNT`. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code (Optional)**  
```prolog
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT), 
        NewSC is SC + 1, 
        NewCNT is CNT - 1, 
        coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT)
    ; 
        NewCNT is CNT - 1, 
        coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT)
    ).
```

**Explanation:**  
- Ensures compatibility with ProbLog's syntax.  
- Guards against negative `CNT` (if added).

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
