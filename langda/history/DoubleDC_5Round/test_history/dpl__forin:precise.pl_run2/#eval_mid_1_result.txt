### **Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Insertion Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The code adheres to the requirements:  
  1. Recursively sorts the tail list.  
  2. Inserts the head element `H` into the sorted list.  
  No discrepancies were found between the actual and expected results.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`[]`), and the insertion logic correctly places elements in ascending order.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, ensuring termination for finite lists.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The result probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic behavior.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement               | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning       | Met         | The code correctly implements insertion sort in classical Prolog.           |
| Probabilistic Reasoning   | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration| Not Used    | DeepProbLog features are absent.                                            |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Performance**: Recursive performance is linear in the worst case (O(nÂ²)), typical for insertion sort.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used     | No impact            | N/A (if not required).              |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The insertion sort implementation is correct for classical Prolog and meets the specified requirements. Edge cases like non-list inputs could be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized, making this a purely deterministic solution.
