### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot navigates between locations while potentially carrying a key. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like `pickup`, `goto`, and `drop`, along with their outcomes. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the code against the given test results.  
- Analyze logical and probabilistic consistency.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.4331  
- `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.9000  
- `at(robot, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0900  
- `at(robot, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0100  
- `at(key, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.5670  
- `at(key, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.4330  
- `at(key, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = 0.0000  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key dynamics.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic outcomes adhere to the specified probabilities (e.g., `0.9::goto_succeeds(T)`).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates (`carrying/2`, `at/3`) correctly model the robot's actions and key movements. Recursive termination is ensured by the base case (`s(0)`) and the absence of infinite loops.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases like `drops(key, T)` and `slippery(key, T)` without undefined behavior.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds(T)`, `drop_slippery_key(T)`, and `goto_succeeds(T)` comply with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`. For example:  
  - `P(pickup_fails(T)) = 1 − 0.7 = 0.3`.  
- **Negation:** The use of `\+` (negation-as-failure) is correct and does not violate probabilistic semantics.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Predicates correctly model robot and key behavior.                          |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met      | Probabilities are correctly computed and combined.                          |
| Neural Network Integration | N/A    | No DeepProbLog features are used.                                           |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are called.  
- **Non-List Input:** The code does not process lists, so this is irrelevant.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the time steps (`s(T)`), ensuring performance.
