### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and identify any failures or logical inconsistencies.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a `NonGroundQuery` error for the query `at(X3, X4, s(s(s(0))))`. This error occurs because the query contains unbound variables (`X3`, `X4`) after grounding, which is not allowed in ProbLog.

**Failed Queries:**  
1. `at(X3, X4, s(s(s(0))))`  
   - **Error:** `NonGroundQuery` (variables `X3` and `X4` remain unbound).  
   - **Expected:** Grounded query with specific values for `X3` and `X4`.

**Passed Queries:**  
1. `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))`  
   - **Result:** No error reported (grounded successfully).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `at(X3, X4, s(s(s(0))))`  
  - **Location:** Line 51 (where the query is defined).  
  - **Root Cause:** The query is not grounded, as it contains variables (`X3`, `X4`) that are not instantiated.  
  - **Affected Predicates:**  
    - `at/3` (lines defining robot and key positions).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The `at/3` predicate is defined recursively but does not ensure grounding for all variables in the query.  
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `at/3` are logically sound, but the query is not properly constrained.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (e.g., `0.9::goto_succeeds(T)`) are correctly defined.  
  - The negation `\+` in `drops(key, T)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - **Issue:** The query `at(X3, X4, s(s(s(0))))` violates ProbLog's requirement for grounded queries.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Feature Not Used:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical rules are correct, but query grounding fails).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
  - **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable (no performance issues).  
  - **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `NonGroundQuery` error   | Query evaluation fails          | Ground the query (e.g., `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0))))`). |
| 2   | Unbound variables in query | Incorrect results               | Ensure all queries are fully instantiated. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code is logically sound but requires grounding for all queries to avoid `NonGroundQuery` errors. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented, and no DeepProbLog features are used. Fixing the query grounding will resolve the test failures.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.
