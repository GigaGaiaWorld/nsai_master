</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and identify any failures or logical inconsistencies.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a `NonGroundQuery` error for the query `at(X3, X4, s(s(s(0))))`. This error occurs because the query contains unbound variables (`X3`, `X4`) after grounding, which is not allowed in ProbLog.

**Failed Queries:**  
1. `at(X3, X4, s(s(s(0))))`  
   - **Error:** `NonGroundQuery` (variables `X3` and `X4` remain unbound).  
   - **Expected:** Grounded query with specific values for `X3` and `X4`.

**Passed Queries:**  
1. `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))`  
   - **Result:** No error reported (grounded successfully).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `at(X3, X4, s(s(s(0))))`  
  - **Location:** Line 51 (where the query is defined).  
  - **Root Cause:** The query is not grounded, as it contains variables (`X3`, `X4`) that are not instantiated.  
  - **Affected Predicates:**  
    - `at/3` (lines defining robot and key positions).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The `at/3` predicate is defined recursively but does not ensure grounding for all variables in the query.  
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `at/3` are logically sound, but the query is not properly constrained.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (e.g., `0.9::goto_succeeds(T)`) are correctly defined.  
  - The negation `\+` in `drops(key, T)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - **Issue:** The query `at(X3, X4, s(s(s(0))))` violates ProbLog's requirement for grounded queries.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Feature Not Used:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical rules are correct, but query grounding fails).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
  - **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable (no performance issues).  
  - **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `NonGroundQuery` error   | Query evaluation fails          | Ground the query (e.g., `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0))))`). |
| 2   | Unbound variables in query | Incorrect results               | Ensure all queries are fully instantiated. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code is logically sound but requires grounding for all queries to avoid `NonGroundQuery` errors. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented, and no DeepProbLog features are used. Fixing the query grounding will resolve the test failures.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

**End of Report**

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
