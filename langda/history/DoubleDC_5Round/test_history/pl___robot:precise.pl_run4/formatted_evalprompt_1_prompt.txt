<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot interacts with a key in a dynamic environment. The robot can pick up the key, move to different locations, and drop the key based on probabilistic events. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code against the given test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the predicates.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4331 |
| `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0900 |
| `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0100 |
| `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.5670 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4330 |
| `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the predicates, and no discrepancies were found.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates are correctly defined, and their behavior matches the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying(key,s(T))`) terminate correctly.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as:
  - The robot not performing any action (`\+ goto_action(T)`).
  - The key being slippery or not (`slippery(key,T)`).

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `goto_succeeds/1` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
- **Negation-as-Failure:** The use of `\+` in predicates like `carrying(key,T)` and `drops(key,T)` adheres to ProbLog's negation semantics.

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The predicates correctly model the robot's actions and the key's state.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and their interactions are correctly implemented.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases and Performance**
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates were found.
- **Non-List Input:** The code does not handle list inputs, but this is not required for the given scenario.
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given time steps (`s(s(s(0)))`).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
Since no errors were found, the table is omitted.

---

### **Final Remarks**
The ProbLog code is well-structured, logically sound, and correctly implements the specified requirements. The test results confirm its accuracy, and no edge cases or performance issues were identified. The absence of DeepProbLog features is noted but does not impact the evaluation. 

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
