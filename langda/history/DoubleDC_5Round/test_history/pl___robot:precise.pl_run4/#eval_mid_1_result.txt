### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot interacts with a key in a dynamic environment. The robot can pick up the key, move to different locations, and drop the key based on probabilistic events. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code against the given test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the predicates.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4331 |
| `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0900 |
| `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0100 |
| `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.5670 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4330 |
| `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the predicates, and no discrepancies were found.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates are correctly defined, and their behavior matches the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying(key,s(T))`) terminate correctly.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as:
  - The robot not performing any action (`\+ goto_action(T)`).
  - The key being slippery or not (`slippery(key,T)`).

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `goto_succeeds/1` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
- **Negation-as-Failure:** The use of `\+` in predicates like `carrying(key,T)` and `drops(key,T)` adheres to ProbLog's negation semantics.

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The predicates correctly model the robot's actions and the key's state.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and their interactions are correctly implemented.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases and Performance**
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates were found.
- **Non-List Input:** The code does not handle list inputs, but this is not required for the given scenario.
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given time steps (`s(s(s(0)))`).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
Since no errors were found, the table is omitted.

---

### **Final Remarks**
The ProbLog code is well-structured, logically sound, and correctly implements the specified requirements. The test results confirm its accuracy, and no edge cases or performance issues were identified. The absence of DeepProbLog features is noted but does not impact the evaluation.
