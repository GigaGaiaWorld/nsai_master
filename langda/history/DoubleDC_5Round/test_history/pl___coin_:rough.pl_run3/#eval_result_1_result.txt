{
  "HASH": "DF1FDC54",
  "ErrorSummary": "Non-ground probabilistic clause 'PH::make_coin(C, PH)' violates ProbLog's requirement for ground probabilistic facts. The recursive logic is correct but cannot execute due to this error.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the non-ground clause with grounded probabilistic facts (e.g., '0.8::coin(heads).'). Also, ensure the 'coin/1' predicate is properly defined for probabilistic reasoning.",
