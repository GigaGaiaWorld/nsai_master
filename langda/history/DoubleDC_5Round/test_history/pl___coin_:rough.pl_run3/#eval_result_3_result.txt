  "ErrorSummary": "Non-ground probabilistic clause 'PH::make_coin(C, PH)' violates ProbLog's requirement for ground probabilistic facts. The recursive logic in 'coins_r/3' is correct but cannot execute due to the grounding error.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Replace 'PH::make_coin(C, PH)' with grounded probabilistic facts (e.g., '0.8::coin(heads)'). 2. Ensure all probabilistic facts are instantiated (e.g., 'coin(heads) :- make_coin(heads, 0.8).'). 3. Add input validation for CNT >= 0.",
