### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Density Calculation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Comparison**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code calculates the population density of countries and identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The code uses deterministic arithmetic operations and logical predicates to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`

**Verification:**  
All test cases pass with a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the code correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities.  

**Conclusion:**  
**All tests passed (no failures).** The results align with the expected behavior of the `query_pop` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned the expected values.  

**Expansion Predicates Verification:**  
The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`). Therefore, this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density using integer division (`//`). The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the densities of the two countries meet the specified conditions (`D1 > D2` and `20*D1 < 21*D2`).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The code does not involve recursion, so termination is not a concern.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. All calculations are deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the logic for comparing population densities.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`, `query_pop/1`) are defined.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list of four elements. Non-list inputs or malformed lists would fail, but this is not tested here.  
- **Performance:** The code does not involve recursion or large datasets, so performance is not a concern.
