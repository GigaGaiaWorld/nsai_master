### **Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant chooses one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens a door that does not contain the prize and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The problem demonstrates counterintuitive probabilistic reasoning.  

This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, focusing on:  
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.  
- Adherence to the problem's rules.  
- Functional requirements (classical and probabilistic reasoning).

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are uniform (1/3 each), as expected.  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic (1.0), matching the code.  
- `win_keep` (probability of winning by keeping the initial choice) is 1/3, correct.  
- `win_switch` (probability of winning by switching) is 2/3, correct.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Uniform Random Opening:** When two doors are available, Monty chooses one uniformly (50% probability).  
2. **Forced Opening:** When only one door is available, Monty must open it.  

The `open_door/1` predicate correctly implements these rules.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list traversal.  
- Recursion in `member/2` terminates as expected.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- Probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly defined (1/3 each).  
- Negation (`\+`) and probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door(Door)`) comply with probabilistic rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled.  
  - The `findall/3` and `length/2` predicates ensure correct door selection.  

**DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Satisfied (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Satisfied (e.g., uniform prize distribution, correct `open_door/1` behavior).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** None detected.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable (input is fixed).  
- **Deep Recursion:** Not an issue (shallow recursion in `member/2`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic rules. No issues were found in classical or probabilistic reasoning. The code is concise and handles edge cases implicitly.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.
