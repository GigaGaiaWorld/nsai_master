### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in ProbLog: Logical Correctness and Probabilistic Compliance**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the logical correctness of the classical Prolog implementation.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules (if applicable).  
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query:**  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed with the correct output and a probability of 1.0000.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are correctly defined and terminate recursively.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The base case (`insertion_sort([], [])`) and recursive case (`insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted)`) are correctly implemented.  
  - The `insert/3` predicate handles the insertion of elements into the sorted list, respecting the order (`X =< Y` and `X > Y`).  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the list is progressively reduced in size (`insertion_sort(T, SortedTail)`).  

##### **ProbLog Analysis**  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior (no probabilistic facts or rules are used).  
  - No violations of probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are present.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement           | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning   | Met         | The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.                              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                  |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls are present.                               |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists (not tested).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list Input Handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2      | Deep Recursion           | Stack overflow risk        | Optimize for tail recursion or use loops.  |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with deep recursion. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
