### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, logical consistency, and adherence to probabilistic rules. The code simulates the scenario where a player selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize, followed by the player's decision to switch or stay.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the results match the expected outcomes.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `open_door/1` predicate correctly implements the Monty Hall rules:  
  - If two doors are available, one is chosen uniformly at random.  
  - If only one door is available, it is opened.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is well-defined and terminates for finite lists.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly computed as `1/3` for each door.  
- Negation (`\+`) is used correctly, adhering to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic correctly simulates the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed accurately.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., doors 1, 2, or 3). Non-list inputs or invalid door numbers would cause errors.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not a concern.

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's theoretical solution. No issues were found in the classical or probabilistic reasoning components. Edge cases are minimal and do not affect the core functionality.
