### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.8743 |
| `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 1.0000 |
| `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9730 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0270 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, where the robot successfully picks up the key and retains it with high probability, while the key's location updates correctly based on the robot's actions.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `drops/2`, and `at/3` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `slippery/2`) terminate correctly due to the base case (`slippery(key,0)`).  
- **Termination:** The recursion depth is bounded by the time steps (`s(T)`), ensuring termination.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `fumbles_key/1` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- **Negation-as-Failure:** The use of `\+` in `drops/2` and `carrying/2` correctly models negation in the probabilistic context.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic rules accurately reflect the uncertainty in actions like picking up or dropping the key.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is controlled by the time steps, avoiding performance issues.
