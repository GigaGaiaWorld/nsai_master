### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Zebra Puzzle**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle, also known as Einstein's Riddle, is a classic logic puzzle requiring deductive reasoning to solve. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on:  
- **Correctness**: Logical accuracy and adherence to puzzle constraints.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance**: Whether the solution aligns with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.  
- **Edge Cases**: Handling of undefined predicates, non-list inputs, and recursive performance.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query**: `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification**: The output matches the expected solution for the Zebra Puzzle.  
- **Conclusion**: **All tests passed (no failures)**. The solution satisfies all puzzle constraints.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Properly checks adjacency using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Accurately verifies relative positioning.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - All constraints (e.g., "the Englishman lives in the red house") are correctly encoded.  
  - Recursive predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`) terminate as expected.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or malformed `house` structures would fail gracefully due to Prolog's unification.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The solution uses deterministic reasoning (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - No violations of `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` observed.  
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement       | Status  | Explanation                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning | Met    | All puzzle constraints are logically enforced.                              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | N/A   | No probabilistic facts/rules used.                                          |
| Neural Integration | N/A     | DeepProbLog features not utilized.                                          |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates**: None found.  
- **Non-list Inputs**: Unlikely due to fixed `houses` structure.  
- **Recursive Performance**: Efficient for small lists (5 houses).
