#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch or stick with their original choice. This ProbLog implementation models the problem and evaluates the probabilities of winning under both strategies (keeping the original choice or switching).

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic (as expected).  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the theoretical probabilities (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules adhere to the requirements:  
- **`open_door/1`**: Correctly handles both scenarios (random selection when both unselected doors are empty and deterministic selection when one unselected door has a prize).  
- **`win_keep` and `win_switch`**: Accurately model the winning conditions for both strategies.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The rules for `open_door/1` ensure the host's behavior aligns with the problem's constraints.  
  - Recursive predicates (e.g., `member/2`) terminate correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Correctness**:  
  - The probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly defined (1/3 each).  
  - Negation (`\+ prize(A)`) complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Satisfied (e.g., `member/2`, deterministic `select_door/1`).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Satisfied (e.g., `prize/1`, `open_door/1`).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code handles all edge cases (e.g., no undefined predicates, valid input types).  
  - Performance is not an issue due to the small problem size.
