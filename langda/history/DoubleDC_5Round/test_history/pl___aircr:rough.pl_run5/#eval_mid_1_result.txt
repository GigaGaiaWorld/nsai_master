### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under probabilistic conditions (actuator choice, wind effects) and checks for goal achievement or overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and logical rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  

| Query                | Probability Result |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions remain minimal.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules function as intended:  
- **`attempted_flap_position/2`** (Lines 20–25): Correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and goal direction.  
- **`legal_flap_position/1`** (Line 3): Ensures positions are within bounds.  
- **`overrun_exception/1`** (Lines 16–18): Triggers when an illegal position is attempted.  

All expansion predicates (e.g., negation, arithmetic) comply with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the decrement of `Time`.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles illegal positions (`\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`) and avoids infinite recursion.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The rules for `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` correctly model uncertainty.  
- **Negation:** The negation `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met (e.g., goal checking, position updates).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (e.g., actuator selection, wind effects).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Undefined positions are handled via `legal_flap_position/1`.  
- Non-list inputs are irrelevant here.  
- Recursive performance is efficient due to bounded time steps (`at(5)`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is robust, logically sound, and probabilistically accurate. No modifications are required.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.
