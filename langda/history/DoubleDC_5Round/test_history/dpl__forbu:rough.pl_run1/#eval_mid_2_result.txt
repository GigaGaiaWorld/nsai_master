---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, aiming to sort a list of integers. The query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` was tested, and the result was verified. This report evaluates the code's correctness, identifies potential issues, and ensures compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`.  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**: The test passed successfully.  
- **Verification of Expansion Predicates**:  
  - No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`) are used in the code.  
  - The code adheres to classical Prolog reasoning without probabilistic extensions.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3` predicates are logically correct and terminate for valid inputs.  
  - The algorithm correctly implements the bubblesort logic by comparing and swapping adjacent elements.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used. The code is purely deterministic.  
  - The result probability of 1.0000 confirms deterministic behavior.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the bubblesort algorithm.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Inputs**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very large lists due to the recursive nature of the algorithm.  
  - **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the base case `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list inputs unhandled | Runtime errors | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2 | Deep recursion | Performance issues | Consider iterative approaches for large lists. |
| 3 | No probabilistic features | Limited to classical reasoning | Extend with probabilistic annotations if needed. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Improvements**  
1. **Input Validation**:  
   ```prolog
   forth_sort(L, L2) :- is_list(L), bubblesort(L, [], L2).
   ```  
2. **Performance Optimization**:  
   - For large lists, consider using a more efficient sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort).  

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The provided ProbLog code successfully implements the bubblesort algorithm and passes all tested queries. While the code is logically sound, improvements such as input validation and performance optimization could enhance robustness. The absence of probabilistic features or neural network integration limits the code to classical reasoning, but it meets the specified requirements effectively.
