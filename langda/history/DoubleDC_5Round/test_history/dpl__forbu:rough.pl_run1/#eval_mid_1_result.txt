### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation and Error Resolution**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, aiming to sort a list of integers. The query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` was tested, resulting in an `UnknownClause` error. This report evaluates the code's correctness, identifies the root cause of the failure, and provides suggestions for resolution.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`.  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 3:15.
  ```  
- **Failure**: The test failed due to an unsupported control construct (`->/2`) in ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `bubble/3` (Line 3).  
- **Error Cause**:  
  - The `->/2` (if-then-else) construct is not supported in ProbLog.  
  - ProbLog restricts control constructs to declarative logic (e.g., conjunction, disjunction, negation-as-failure).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The algorithm is logically correct in Prolog but violates ProbLog's syntax rules.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured for valid inputs.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used.  
  - The error is purely syntactic, not probabilistic.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but syntactically invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not handled.  
  - The `expand/2` predicate is undefined (not relevant here).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported `->/2` construct | Code fails to execute | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)`). |
| 2 | No probabilistic features | Limited to classical reasoning | Add probabilistic annotations (e.g., `p::fact`) if needed. |
| 3 | Edge cases unhandled | Potential runtime errors | Validate input types and limit recursion depth. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the `bubble/3` predicate with ProbLog-compatible logic:  
```prolog
bubble([X], [], X).
bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :-
    (H1 =< H2, X1 = H1, bubble([H2 | T], T1, X));
    (H1 > H2, X1 = H2, bubble([H1 | T], T1, X)).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The code's logical structure is sound, but its reliance on Prolog's `->/2` construct makes it incompatible with ProbLog. By adapting the control flow to ProbLog's declarative syntax, the algorithm can be successfully executed. Further enhancements could include probabilistic extensions and edge-case handling.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.
