System: You are a coding assistant. You should use the available tools to complete the task.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in ProbLog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to analyze the provided code and its test results, strictly following the instructions below.

<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>bubble([X], [], X).
bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :-
    (H1 =< H2, X1 = H1, bubble([H2 | T], T1, X));
    (H1 > H2, X1 = H2, bubble([H1 | T], T1, X)).

bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L1, X),
    bubblesort(L1, [X | Acc], Sorted).

forth_sort(L, L2) :- bubblesort(L, [], L2).

query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).</Code_Block>
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, aiming to sort a list of integers. The query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` was tested, and the result was verified. This report evaluates the code's correctness, identifies potential issues, and ensures compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`.  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**: The test passed successfully.  
- **Verification of Expansion Predicates**:  
  - No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`) are used in the code.  
  - The code adheres to classical Prolog reasoning without probabilistic extensions.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3` predicates are logically correct and terminate for valid inputs.  
  - The algorithm correctly implements the bubblesort logic by comparing and swapping adjacent elements.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used. The code is purely deterministic.  
  - The result probability of 1.0000 confirms deterministic behavior.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the bubblesort algorithm.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Inputs**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very large lists due to the recursive nature of the algorithm.  
  - **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the base case `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list inputs unhandled | Runtime errors | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2 | Deep recursion | Performance issues | Consider iterative approaches for large lists. |
| 3 | No probabilistic features | Limited to classical reasoning | Extend with probabilistic annotations if needed. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Improvements**  
1. **Input Validation**:  
   ```prolog
   forth_sort(L, L2) :- is_list(L), bubblesort(L, [], L2).
   ```  
2. **Performance Optimization**:  
   - For large lists, consider using a more efficient sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort).  

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The provided ProbLog code successfully implements the bubblesort algorithm and passes all tested queries. While the code is logically sound, improvements such as input validation and performance optimization could enhance robustness. The absence of probabilistic features or neural network integration limits the code to classical reasoning, but it meets the specified requirements effectively.  

**Word Count**: 400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
