</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for moves, win/lose conditions, and a scoring mechanism. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The query failed with the error:  
  ```
  CallModeError: Invalid argument types for call to '</2': arguments: (X1, 0), expected: (ground, ground) at 41:108.
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test failed due to non-ground arguments in the comparison operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically at line 41.  
- **Root Cause**:  
  The comparison `Score > 0` (or `<`) requires both arguments to be ground (instantiated) in ProbLog. The error suggests `Score` is not ground at the time of comparison.  
- **Affected Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The comparison operators (`>`, `<`) require ground arguments.  
  - The `compute_score` predicate must ensure `Score` is ground before comparison.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are involved in this error.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) is used.  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails due to non-ground comparison).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not handled explicitly.  
  - The `expand/2` predicate is not defined or used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground comparison (`Score > 0`) | Query fails                     | Ensure `Score` is ground before comparison. |
| 2   | Undefined `expand/2`             | Not applicable here             | Define if needed for future extensions.    |
| 3   | No input validation              | May crash on non-list inputs    | Add checks for list inputs.                |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. **Ground the `Score` Variable**:  
   Modify the `compute_score` predicate to ensure `Score` is ground before comparison. For example:  
   ```prolog
   compute_score([], 0).
   compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
   compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
   compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.
   ```
2. **Input Validation**:  
   Add checks to ensure `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists.  
3. **Document Edge Cases**:  
   Explicitly handle edge cases like empty lists or invalid moves.  

**Word Count**: 400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
