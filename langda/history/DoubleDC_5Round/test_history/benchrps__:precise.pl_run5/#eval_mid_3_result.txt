### **Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for moves, win/lose conditions, and a scoring mechanism. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The query failed with the error:  
  ```
  CallModeError: Invalid argument types for call to '</2': arguments: (X1, 0), expected: (ground, ground) at 41:108.
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test failed due to non-ground arguments in the comparison operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically at line 41.  
- **Root Cause**:  
  The comparison `Score > 0` (or `<`) requires both arguments to be ground (instantiated) in ProbLog. The error suggests `Score` is not ground at the time of comparison.  
- **Affected Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The comparison operators (`>`, `<`) require ground arguments.  
  - The `compute_score` predicate must ensure `Score` is ground before comparison.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are involved in this error.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) is used.  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails due to non-ground comparison).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not handled explicitly.  
  - The `expand/2` predicate is not defined or used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground comparison (`Score > 0`) | Query fails                     | Ensure `Score` is ground before comparison. |
| 2   | Undefined `expand/2`             | Not applicable here             | Define if needed for future extensions.    |
| 3   | No input validation              | May crash on non-list inputs    | Add checks for list inputs.                |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. **Ground the `Score` Variable**:  
   Modify the `compute_score` predicate to ensure `Score` is ground before comparison. For example:  
   ```prolog
   compute_score([], 0).
   compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
   compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
   compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.
   ```
2. **Input Validation**:  
   Add checks to ensure `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists.  
3. **Document Edge Cases**:  
   Explicitly handle edge cases like empty lists or invalid moves.  

**Word Count**: 400 words.
