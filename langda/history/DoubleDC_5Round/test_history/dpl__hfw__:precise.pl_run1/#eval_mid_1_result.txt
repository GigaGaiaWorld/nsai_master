### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of symbols (numbers and operators). The goal is to ensure correctness in classical Prolog reasoning and probabilistic scenarios (if applicable). The evaluation focuses on:  
- **Test Results Verification**  
- **Failure Localization**  
- **Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Overall Functional Compliance**  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query Executed:**  
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
- `X = 0.0000` (correct for `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`).  

**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The result matches the expected value, confirming the correctness of the `parse/2` predicates for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The following predicates were verified:  
- `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, `detect_all/2`, `almost_equal/2`, `expression/2`, and `parse/2`.  
- **Expansion Predicates:** Not applicable (no `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc., were used).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive `parse/2` predicates correctly handle nested operations (e.g., `[N1, + | T]`).  
  - Termination is ensured by base case `parse([N], R)`.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined operators would fail gracefully (not explicitly handled).  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **DeepProbLog Features:** Not used (`nn/3`, `tensor/…` absent).  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or negations).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements Met:**  
| Requirement          | Status  | Explanation                                  |
|----------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | ✅      | Correct parsing and evaluation of expressions. |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | ❌    | No probabilistic facts or rules used.         |
| Neural Network Integration | ❌  | DeepProbLog features not utilized.            |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid symbols are not handled.  
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance impact for very long lists is unverified.

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| No. | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                          |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | No probabilistic features | Limited functionality | Add probabilistic facts if needed.  |
| 2   | No input validation      | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for list structure.      |
