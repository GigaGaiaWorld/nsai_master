### **Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Analyze compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  
- Identify potential edge cases and performance issues.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Length Check**: The predicate `length(List, Len)` ensures recursive splitting only for lists with `Len > 1`.  
2. **Recursive Boundary**: Base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) handle lists of length 0 and 1.  
3. **Splitting and Merging**: The `split_list` and `merge` predicates correctly split and merge sublists.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursion terminates correctly for all list lengths.  
  - The `merge` predicate ensures the sorted order by comparing elements (`H1 =< H2` or `H1 > H2`).  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Empty lists and single-element lists are handled explicitly.  
  - Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers) are not addressed but are irrelevant for this implementation.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior.  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used**. No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement               | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning       | Satisfied   | The implementation correctly sorts lists using merge sort.                  |
| Probabilistic Reasoning   | Not Used    | No probabilistic facts or rules are employed.                               |
| Neural Network Integration| Not Used    | No DeepProbLog features are utilized.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases and Performance**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms) are not handled but are beyond the scope of this implementation.  
- **Deep Recursion**: The algorithm splits lists recursively, which could lead to stack overflow for very large lists. However, this is inherent to the merge sort algorithm.  
- **Performance**: Merge sort in Prolog/ProbLog is efficient for typical use cases but may suffer from overhead due to list manipulation.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling  | Low (edge case)      | Add input validation if required.           |
| 2   | Deep recursion           | Moderate (large lists)| Optimize tail recursion if possible.        |

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is correct and adheres to ProbLog's syntax. While it lacks probabilistic features, it serves as a robust classical Prolog program. Future enhancements could include input validation and performance optimizations for large datasets.
