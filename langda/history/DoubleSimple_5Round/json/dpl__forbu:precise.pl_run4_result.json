  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm in Prolog, and they produce the same sorted output for the given input list. The main difference lies in the definition of the 'swap' predicate. The original code uses negation ('\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)') to determine a swap, while the generated code directly checks 'X > Y' for a swap and 'X =< Y' for no swap. This change is logically equivalent and does not affect the outcome."
