  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, the first rule for 'carrying(key,s(T))' is incomplete as it misses the conditions 'at(robot,Pos,T)' and 'at(key,Pos,T)'. Second, the second rule for 'carrying(key,s(T))' incorrectly uses 'retains_key(T)' instead of the original conditions. Third, there is a syntax error in the 'at(robot,NewPos,s(T))' rule due to an unmatched parenthesis. These issues make the generated code invalid and inconsistent with the original code."
