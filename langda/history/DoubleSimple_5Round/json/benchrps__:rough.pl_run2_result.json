  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it redundantly repeats the definitions of 'move' and 'beats' predicates, which are already defined in the original code. Second, the 'play' predicate in the generated code uses a different implementation with conditional statements (->) instead of the original 'result' predicate, which changes the logic structure. Most critically, the generated code contains a syntax error (unmatched '(') that prevents it from running, as indicated by the error message. This makes the generated code invalid and its results inconsistent with the original code."
