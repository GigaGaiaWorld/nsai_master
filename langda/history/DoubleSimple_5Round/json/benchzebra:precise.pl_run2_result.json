  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code, with one minor difference: 'snails' in the original code is written as 'snail' in the generated code. This typo does not affect the overall logic or the correctness of the solution, as the rest of the constraints and structure remain the same. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the requirements."
