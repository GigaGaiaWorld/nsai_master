  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image digits into a numerical value. It then uses this to perform addition of multi-digit numbers, which is a logical extension of the original single-digit addition. The code is syntactically correct and produces the expected result for the given query. The result (79 + 312 = 391) is correct, demonstrating that the generated code works as intended."
