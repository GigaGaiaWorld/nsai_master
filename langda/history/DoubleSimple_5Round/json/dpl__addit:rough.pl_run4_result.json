  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle lists of digits and form multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The code is logically consistent with the original but operates on a more complex input structure. The result correctly computes the sum of 79 and 312 as 391, demonstrating that the generated code meets the extended requirements. Both the form and the result are valid."
