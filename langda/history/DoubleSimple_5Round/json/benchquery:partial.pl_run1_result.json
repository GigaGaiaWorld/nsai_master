  "final_report": "The generated code is identical to the original code in both structure and functionality. It correctly implements the query to find countries with approximately equal population density. The generated code maintains all the original data entries for population and area, and the logic for calculating density and comparing countries remains unchanged. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output pairs of countries with similar population densities."
