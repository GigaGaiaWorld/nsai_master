  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the cryptoaddition problem. Both codes correctly implement the constraints and logic for solving AB + BCD = CDE with unique digits. The generated code is slightly more compact in its predicate definitions but maintains all necessary conditions and calculations. No functional differences or problems are observed."
