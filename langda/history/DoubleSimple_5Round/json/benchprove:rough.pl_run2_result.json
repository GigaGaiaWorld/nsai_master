  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there are some redundancies, such as the duplicate definitions of 'prove(true)', 'prove(Goal)', and 'prove((A,B))'. The logic for 'prove(implies(A,B))' in the generated code is incorrect as it requires both A and B to be provable, whereas the original code correctly implements the implication (A ⇒ B) by checking if A is unprovable or B is provable. Despite this, the running results are consistent with the original code for the given queries."
