  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The main difference is in the implementation of the 'sort' operation, where the generated code uses 'sort0' instead of 'insertion_sort', but this does not affect the functionality as both achieve the same result. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their consistency."
