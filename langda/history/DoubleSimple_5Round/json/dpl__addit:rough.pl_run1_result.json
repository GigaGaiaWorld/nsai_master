  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle lists of digits and form multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. This is a valid extension of the original code's logic. The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements. The running result correctly shows the addition of 79 and 312, yielding 391, which is consistent with the expected behavior based on the original code's logic."
