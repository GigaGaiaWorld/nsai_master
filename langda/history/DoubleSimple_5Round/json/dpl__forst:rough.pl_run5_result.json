  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct but has a critical issue in the 'rot' operation where it incorrectly rotates elements (should be [Z,X,Y|Stack] but is [Y,Z,X|Stack]). The sorting operation is simplified to sort the entire stack rather than just the top N elements, which deviates from the original specification. The generated code is valid in form but does not fully meet the original requirements. The results are consistent except for the 'rot' operation."
