  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define the same digit facts and the addition predicate, which performs the same arithmetic operation. The only difference is the formatting and variable naming (XD and YD instead of X2 and Y2), which does not affect the logic or outcome. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same output for the query."
