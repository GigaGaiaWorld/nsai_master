  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. The key differences are in the ordering of conditions in some rules (e.g., the second rule for 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))'), but these do not affect the semantic meaning or the execution results. The generated code maintains all the probabilistic facts and rules from the original, and the queries remain unchanged. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code correctly replicates the behavior of the original."
