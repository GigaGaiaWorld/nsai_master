  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It successfully solves the zebra puzzle with the same constraints and produces identical results. The main difference lies in the reorganization of predicate definitions (my_member, next_to, right_of) and the removal of redundant next_to clauses, which does not affect the outcome. The generated code is more concise while maintaining all necessary logic."
