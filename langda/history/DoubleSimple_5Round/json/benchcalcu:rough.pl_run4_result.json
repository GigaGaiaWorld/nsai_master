  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the cryptoaddition problem. The main differences are in formatting and the order of constraints in the 'query_sum' predicate, which does not affect the logic or outcome. The generated code maintains all necessary constraints and operations, including digit definitions, leftdigit checks, sumdigit calculations, and all_different checks. Both codes yield identical results, confirming their consistency."
