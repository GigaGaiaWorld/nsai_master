  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm in Prolog, and they produce the same sorted output for the given input list. The main difference lies in the definition of the 'swap' predicate. The original code uses negation ('\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)') for the swap case, while the generated code directly defines the conditions for swapping ('X > Y') and not swapping ('X =< Y'). This change does not affect the correctness or the result of the sorting algorithm."
