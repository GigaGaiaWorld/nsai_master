  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for prize selection, door opening, and winning outcomes (keep vs switch). The generated code simplifies some conditions and adds clarity by explicitly stating the selection of doors, but maintains the same logical flow and outcomes. No problems are identified in the generated code."
