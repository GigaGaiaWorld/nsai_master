  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the original Monty Hall problem implementation but introduces errors. The main issue is in the 'open_door' predicate, which lacks proper probabilistic handling and causes an 'UnknownClause' error during execution. The original code correctly models the problem with probabilistic choices for opening doors, while the generated version fails to maintain this probabilistic nature. The generated code is not valid as it doesn't run successfully."
