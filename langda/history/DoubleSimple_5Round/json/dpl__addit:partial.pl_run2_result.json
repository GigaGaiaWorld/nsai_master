  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define the same digit facts and the addition predicate, which performs the same arithmetic operation. The only difference is the formatting of the addition predicate, where the generated code splits the clause into multiple lines, but this does not affect the logic or execution. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same output for the query addition(img_5,img_6,Z)."
