  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, the extended logic processing definitions (implies, opposite, expand, includes, extend, refute) are incorrectly placed outside the prove/1 predicate, which changes their functionality and causes them to not work as meta-interpreter extensions. This structural difference leads to incorrect behavior and a timeout during execution. The original code correctly embeds these extensions within the prove/1 predicate, maintaining the meta-interpreter structure. The generated code's form is invalid due to this misplacement, and its results are inconsistent with the original code."
