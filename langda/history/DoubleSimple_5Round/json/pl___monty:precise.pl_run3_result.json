  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for the prize, select_door, win_keep, and win_switch queries. The generated code introduces some syntactic differences, such as the explicit use of 'Selected' in the open_door rules, but these do not affect the logic or outcomes. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
