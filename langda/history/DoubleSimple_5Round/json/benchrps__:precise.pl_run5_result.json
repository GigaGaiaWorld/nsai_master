  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it introduces a syntax error by using an arrow operator '->' in the 'determine_winner' predicate, which is not valid in standard Prolog syntax. This causes the code to fail during execution. The original code correctly uses semicolons ';' for disjunction. The logic for determining the winner based on the score is otherwise the same."
