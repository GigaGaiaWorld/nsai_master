  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm, but the generated code uses a different approach by separating the bubble and bubblesort predicates more clearly. The generated code is more concise and avoids the use of auxiliary predicates like 'hole' and 'swap'. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list."
