The original code directly uses 'coin(C)' within the 'coins_r' predicate to determine the outcome, while the generated code attempts to separate this logic into a new predicate, leading to incorrect syntax and execution failure. The generated code does not meet the requirements as it fails to run and produces different results compared to the original code."
