  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a minor issue in the `compute_score` predicate where the clause for `draw` incorrectly passes `S1` directly instead of assigning it to `S`. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output for the given query."
