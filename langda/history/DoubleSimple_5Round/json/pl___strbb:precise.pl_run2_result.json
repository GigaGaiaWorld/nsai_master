  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there is a subtle difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'pick(I+1,b)' directly instead of first calculating 'II is I+1' and then using 'pick(II,b)'. This change does not affect the logical correctness but leads to a different probability calculation, resulting in a different output (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results due to this modification."
