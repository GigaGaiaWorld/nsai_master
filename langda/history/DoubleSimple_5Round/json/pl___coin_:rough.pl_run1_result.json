  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. The original code uses a single predicate with disjunction (;) to handle both coin success and failure cases, while the generated code splits these into two separate predicates. This structural change does not affect the logic or the outcome, as evidenced by the identical run results. Both codes correctly model the probabilistic scenario of flipping four coins with an 0.8 probability of success each, and the results match the expected binomial distribution probabilities."
