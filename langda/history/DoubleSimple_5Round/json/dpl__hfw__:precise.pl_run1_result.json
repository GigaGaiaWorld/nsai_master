  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, which leads to incorrect evaluation of expressions. Specifically, it changes the way subtraction and division are handled, causing a runtime error due to non-ground arguments in the 'almost_equal' predicate. The original code correctly processes the expression by transforming subtraction into addition of a negative product and handles division with proper checks. The generated code fails to maintain this logic, resulting in an invalid form and inconsistent results."
