  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image references into a multi-digit number, and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these multi-digit numbers. This is a valid extension of the original code's concept. The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements of handling multi-digit addition. The running result correctly shows the addition of 79 and 312 to yield 391, demonstrating that the code works as intended."
