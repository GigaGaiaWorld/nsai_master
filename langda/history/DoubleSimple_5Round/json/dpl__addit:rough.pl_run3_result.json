  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle lists of digits and form multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. This is a valid extension of the original concept. The code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements. The result of the query is correct, demonstrating that 79 + 231 equals 310, which is consistent with the expected behavior."
