  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic, but there are some differences in the implementation of the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate. The generated code uses 'Target is PrevPos - 2' to calculate the target position, which is a fixed value, whereas the original code dynamically calculates the target based on the goal position. This difference leads to inconsistent results between the two codes. The generated code is valid in form but produces different probabilities for goal_reached and overrun_exception compared to the original code."
