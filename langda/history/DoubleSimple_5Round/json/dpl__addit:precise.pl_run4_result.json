  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image identifiers into a multi-digit number and then performs addition. This is a valid extension of the original concept, which only handled single-digit additions. The code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements. The result of the query 'multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)' correctly computes 79 + 312 = 391, demonstrating that the generated code works as intended."
