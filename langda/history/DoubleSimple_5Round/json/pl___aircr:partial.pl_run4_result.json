  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code. It maintains all the core logic, including the flap position control, actuator selection, wind effect modeling, and exception handling. The only differences are minor formatting changes (line breaks and spacing) which do not affect the program's behavior. The running results are identical, confirming that the generated code produces the same probabilities for goal_reached and overrun_exception as the original."
