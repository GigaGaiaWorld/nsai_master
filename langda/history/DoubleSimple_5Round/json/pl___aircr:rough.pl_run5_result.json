  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. The logic and structure of the generated code match the original, with only minor syntactic differences (like variable naming and line breaks) that do not affect functionality. The generated code correctly implements the aircraft flap controller logic, including actuator selection, wind effects, and position updates. The running results are identical to the original, confirming functional equivalence."
