  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it introduces a syntax error by using an arrow operator '->' in the determine_winner predicate, which is not valid in standard Prolog syntax. This causes the code to fail during execution. The original code uses a correct disjunction with semicolons. The logic for determining the winner based on the score is conceptually the same in both codes, but the generated code's syntax error prevents it from running successfully."
