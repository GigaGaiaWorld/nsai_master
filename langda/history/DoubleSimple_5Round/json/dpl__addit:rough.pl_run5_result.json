  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of digit images into a numerical value. This allows for multi-digit addition, which is a logical extension of the original single-digit addition. The code is correctly implemented and produces the expected result for the given query. The result of 310 for adding [img_7, img_9] (79) and [img_3, img_1, img_2] (312) is correct, demonstrating that the generated code works as intended."
