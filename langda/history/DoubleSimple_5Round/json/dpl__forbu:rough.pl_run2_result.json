  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm, though the generated code simplifies the logic by directly comparing and swapping elements without using auxiliary predicates like 'hole' and 'swap'. The generated code is more concise and easier to understand. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list."
