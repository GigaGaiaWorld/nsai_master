  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The only differences are minor formatting changes, such as the removal of comments and slight adjustments to the layout of some predicates. These changes do not affect the behavior or results of the code. Both pieces of code produce identical results when run, as evidenced by the matching run results."
