  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with a few minor issues. The main difference is the use of 'snail' instead of 'snails' in the generated code, which is a typographical error. Additionally, the generated code redundantly repeats some predicate definitions (houses, right_of, next_to, my_member, query) at the end, which is unnecessary but does not affect functionality. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same solution to the zebra puzzle."
