  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the incorrect use of the conditional operator '->' which is not valid in Problog syntax. This leads to a runtime error ('UnknownClause') as Problog does not recognize this operator. The original code uses a disjunction (;) to handle the probabilistic choice, which is the correct approach in Problog. The generated code fails both in form and in producing consistent results with the original code."
