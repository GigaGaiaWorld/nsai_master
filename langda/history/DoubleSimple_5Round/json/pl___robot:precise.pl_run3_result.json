  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. Both codes produce identical run results, indicating that the generated code correctly implements the intended probabilistic logic. The only minor difference is in the ordering of conditions in some rules (e.g., the second rule for 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))'), which does not affect the semantics or the outcome. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
