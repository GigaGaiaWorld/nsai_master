  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but contains a syntax error in the 'open_door' predicate, specifically with the '->/2' operator, which causes the Problog engine to fail. The original code correctly implements the problem with proper probabilistic rules for opening doors and calculating win probabilities for both keeping and switching choices. The generated code's structure is similar but invalid due to the syntax error, preventing it from running successfully."
