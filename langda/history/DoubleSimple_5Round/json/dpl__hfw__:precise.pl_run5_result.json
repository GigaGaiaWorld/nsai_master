  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, which leads to incorrect handling of operator precedence and associativity. Specifically, it fails to properly process nested expressions like '2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7'. The error occurs because the generated code attempts to evaluate 'abs(X1-2*7.0)' in a non-ground context, violating Prolog's mode constraints. The original code correctly handles such expressions by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts."
