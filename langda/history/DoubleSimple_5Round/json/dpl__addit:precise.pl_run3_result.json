  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image identifiers into a multi-digit number. The 'multi_addition' predicate then performs addition on these multi-digit numbers. The code is valid and correctly implements the extended functionality, as evidenced by the correct result (79 + 312 = 391). The generated code is consistent with the original in terms of logic but handles more complex cases. No problems were identified."
