  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for the queries. The generated code has some syntactic differences, such as the addition of 'select_door(Selected)' in the open_door rules, but these do not affect the logic or outcomes. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
