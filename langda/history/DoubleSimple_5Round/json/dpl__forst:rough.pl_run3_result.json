  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct but has a critical issue in the 'rot' operation where it incorrectly rotates elements (should be [Z,X,Y|Stack] but is [Y,Z,X|Stack]). The 'sort' operation is simplified but lacks the original's top-N element sorting feature. The code structure is valid, but the functionality differs. The results match except for the 'rot' operation."
