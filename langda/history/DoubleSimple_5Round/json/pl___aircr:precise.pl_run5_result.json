  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. The only change is in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where the condition '\\+ goal(Old)' is replaced with '\\+ goal_reached(Prev)'. This change does not affect the logic or the results, as both conditions ensure that the flap continues to move only if the goal has not been reached. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
