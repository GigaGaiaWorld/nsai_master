{"HASH": "FA856BCD","ErrorSummary": "The predicate bb(N) is incomplete and incorrectly implemented. The current implementation doesn't properly check for adjacent 'b's as required. Also, the test result shows bb(5) = 1.0000 which is incorrect as it should be a probability less than 1.","SuggestedFix": "Replace the bb(N) predicate with:\nbb(N) :-\n    Max is N-1,\n    between(1,Max,I),\n    pick(I,b),\n    pick(I+1,b).\nAlso ensure the query is properly defined as:\nquery(bb(X)) :- len(X).\nThe probabilities should be properly calculated based on the 0.5 probability for each pick.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
