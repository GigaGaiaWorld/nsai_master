Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly implement the `open_door/1` predicate according to the Monty Hall problem rules. Here's the complete regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "55F6DA26","Code": "1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).\nselect_door(1).\nmember(X,[X|T]).\nmember(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).\n\nopen_door(D) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X\\=Selected, \+prize(X)), PossibleDoors),\n    (   length(PossibleDoors, 2) ->\n        member(D, PossibleDoors)\n    ;   PossibleDoors = [D]\n    ).\n\nwin_keep :-\n    select_door(A),\n    prize(A).\nwin_switch :-\n    member(A, [1,2,3]),\n    \\+ select_door(A),\n    prize(A),\n    \\+ open_door(A).\nquery(prize(_)).\nquery(select_door(_)).\nquery(win_keep).\nquery(win_switch)."}
```

The key changes made:
1. Implemented the `open_door/1` predicate with two cases:
   - When there are two possible doors (neither has prize nor is selected), it chooses uniformly at random
   - When there's only one possible door, it must choose that one
2. Used `findall` to collect all possible doors Monty can open
3. Used length check to determine which case applies
4. Maintained all other existing predicates and queries

The implementation now correctly follows the Monty Hall problem rules as specified in the requirements.
