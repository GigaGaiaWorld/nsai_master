{"HASH": "55F6DA26","ErrorSummary": "Missing predicate definition for open_door/1 and incorrect syntax in the query statements","SuggestedFix": "1. Add the open_door/1 predicate definition before its use in win_switch. 2. Move the query statements to be after all predicate definitions. The corrected code should have the structure: prize/1 definitions, select_door/1, member/2, open_door/1, win_keep, win_switch, then query statements.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
