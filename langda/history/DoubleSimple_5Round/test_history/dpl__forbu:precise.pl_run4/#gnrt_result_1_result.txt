Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly implement the bubblesort algorithm by recursively calling bubblesort on L2 and putting the current maximum value X into the sorted part [X|L3].

```problog
{"HASH": "2971FD2F","Code": "bubblesort([X|L1],L3,Sorted) :- bubble([X|L1],L2,X), bubblesort(L2,[X|L3],Sorted)."}
```

The regenerated code completes the bubblesort predicate by:
1. Calling bubble to get the current maximum X and the remaining list L2
2. Recursively calling bubblesort on L2 while accumulating the sorted elements in [X|L3]
3. This matches the requirement of recursively processing L2 and building the sorted list properly
