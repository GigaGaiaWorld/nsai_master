{"HASH": "BCB17653","ErrorSummary": "The second at/3 predicate for the key's position incorrectly uses carrying(key,s(T)) in the negative condition, which should be carrying(key,T) to match the time step with the robot's position","SuggestedFix": "Change the second at/3 predicate to: at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- \\+ carrying(key,T), at(key,Pos,T). This ensures the key remains stationary when not being carried at the current time step.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
