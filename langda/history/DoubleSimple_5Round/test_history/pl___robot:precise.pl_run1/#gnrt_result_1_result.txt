Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to add two `at/3` predicates for the key's position that weren't present in the original code. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "BCB17653","Code": "at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- carrying(key,T), at(robot,Pos,T).\nat(key,Pos,s(T)) :- \\+ carrying(key,s(T)), at(key,Pos,T)."}
```

The first predicate states that if the robot is carrying the key at time T and is at position Pos, then the key is also at Pos at time s(T). The second predicate states that if the robot is not carrying the key at time s(T), then the key remains where it was at time T. These rules implement the requirements that:
1. When the robot carries the key, they move together
2. When the robot doesn't carry the key, the key stays in place
