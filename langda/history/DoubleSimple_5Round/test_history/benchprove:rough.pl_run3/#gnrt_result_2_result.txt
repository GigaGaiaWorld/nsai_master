Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to include all the specified extended logic processing predicates. Here's the complete regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "2DFC0CFD","Code": "% --------- Extended logic processing ---------
implies(A, B) :- prove(A), prove(B).
opposite(A) :- \+ prove(A).
expand(Goal, Result) :- clause(Goal, Body), prove(Body), Result = Goal.
includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).
extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).
refute(Goal) :- opposite(Goal)."}
```

This regenerated code includes:
1. implies/2 - succeeds if both arguments can be proven
2. opposite/1 - succeeds if the argument cannot be proven
3. expand/2 - uses existing rules to expand a goal
4. includes/2 - checks if an element is in a list (using member/2)
5. extend/2 - adds an element to the head of a list
6. refute/1 - alias for opposite/1

The code maintains the same functionality while adding all the required predicates in a concise format as requested.
