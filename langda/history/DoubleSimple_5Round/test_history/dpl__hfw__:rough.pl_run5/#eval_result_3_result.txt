{"HASH": "FB41E2F7","ErrorSummary": "Operator precedence not handled correctly in parse/2, leading to incorrect evaluation order (current implementation evaluates left-to-right without considering operator precedence)","SuggestedFix": "Modify parse/2 to handle operator precedence by either: 1) restructuring the rules to evaluate higher precedence operators first, or 2) implementing a proper expression parser that builds an AST. For immediate fix, add parentheses grouping for multiplication/division operations.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
