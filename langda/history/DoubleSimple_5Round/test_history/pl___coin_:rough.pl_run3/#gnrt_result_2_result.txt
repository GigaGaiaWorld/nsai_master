Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly sample CNT independent coins and accumulate the number of heads. The current code is incomplete and doesn't implement the coin tossing logic.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","Code": "PH::make_coin(C,PH).\ncoin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n coin(C),\n (C -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC is SC),\n CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).\ntotal(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).\nquery(total(_))."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Keeps the original coin definition with 0.8 probability of heads
2. Properly implements the recursive coins_r/3 predicate that:
   - Samples a coin toss (coin(C))
   - Increments the head count if heads (C is true)
   - Decrements the counter and recurses
3. Maintains the same interface with total/1 and query/1 predicates

The code now correctly accumulates the number of heads when tossing 4 coins with 0.8 probability of heads each.
