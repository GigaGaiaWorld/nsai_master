<Requirements>  1. Check if the goal has been reached:  If Old already satisfies goal(Old), no new trial position is calculated.    2.Determine the current actuator and its strength:  Select actuator A (use_actuator) according to time Time, and get its thrust AS from actuator_strength(A).    3. Calculate the direction and contribution of the actuator  Take the global target position GP (goal(GP)), and compare the difference direction between GP and Old:  - If the target is in front of the current direction, AE = +AS; if in the opposite direction, AE = −AS;  - Specific calculation: AE = sign(GP − Old) × AS.    4. Superimpose wind interference:  Take the additional effect WE of the wind force on the position at that moment from wind_effect(Time).    Combine the trial position of this step:  Add the three parts and get the current attempt flapping position Pos. </Requirements></Langda>

 % Problog Inference Result：

goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
