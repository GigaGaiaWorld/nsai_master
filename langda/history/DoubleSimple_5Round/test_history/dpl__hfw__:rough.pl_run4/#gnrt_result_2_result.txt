Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to regenerate the parse/2 predicate to handle arithmetic operations in list form while considering the almost_equal predicate. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "FB41E2F7","Code": "parse([N, '+', M], R) :- almost_equal(N + M, R).\nparse([N, '-', M], R) :- almost_equal(N - M, R).\nparse([N, '*', M], R) :- almost_equal(N * M, R).\nparse([N, '/', M], R) :- almost_equal(N / M, R).\nparse([N, Op, M|Rest], R) :- \n    parse([N, Op, M], Temp),\n    parse([Temp|Rest], R)."}
```

This implementation:
1. Defines separate parse/2 predicates for each arithmetic operation
2. Uses the almost_equal predicate for floating point comparisons
3. Handles chained operations through recursion
4. Matches the operator symbols detected by detect_operator/2
5. Follows the requirement to have each operation under a separate parse/2 predicate
