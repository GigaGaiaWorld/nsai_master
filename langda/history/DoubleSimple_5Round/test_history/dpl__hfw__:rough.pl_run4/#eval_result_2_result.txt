{"HASH": "FB41E2F7", "ErrorSummary": "The parse/2 predicate does not correctly handle the case where the list has more than one operation, leading to incorrect calculation order (not following standard arithmetic precedence).", "SuggestedFix": "Modify the parse/2 predicate to properly handle operator precedence by either: 1) implementing proper precedence rules in the parsing logic, or 2) using parentheses to enforce evaluation order. For example, the current implementation evaluates '2/3+3-2*7' left-to-right without considering operator precedence, resulting in 11.666... instead of the correct -10.333...", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
