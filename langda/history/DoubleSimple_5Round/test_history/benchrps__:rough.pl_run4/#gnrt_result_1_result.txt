Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code for defining the rock-paper-scissors game rules. The current code is incomplete as it's missing the core game play logic (the `play/3` predicate) that determines win/lose/draw outcomes between moves.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "Code": "move(rock).\nmove(paper).\nmove(scissor).\nbeats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(scissor, paper).\nbeats(paper, rock).\n\nplay([], [], []).\nplay([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-\n    (beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win;\n     beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose;\n     Result = draw),\n    play(P1s, P2s, Results).\n\ncompute_score([], 0).\ncompute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.\ncompute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.\ncompute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.\n\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- \n    play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), \n    compute_score(Results,S), \n    (S > 0, Winner = player1; \n     S < 0, Winner = player2; \n     S = 0, Winner = draw).\n\nquery(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W))."}
