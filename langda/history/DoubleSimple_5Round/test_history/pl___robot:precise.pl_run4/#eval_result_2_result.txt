{"HASH": "BCB17653", "ErrorSummary": "The second at/3 predicate for the key's position is incorrect. It should maintain the key's position when not carried, but the current implementation incorrectly checks for carrying at s(T) instead of T.", "SuggestedFix": "Replace the second at/3 predicate with: 'at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- at(key,Pos,T), \\+ carrying(key,T).' This ensures the key stays in its position when not being carried at time T.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
