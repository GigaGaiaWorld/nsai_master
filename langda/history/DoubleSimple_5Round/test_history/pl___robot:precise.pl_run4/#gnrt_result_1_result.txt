Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to add two `at/3` predicates for the key's position that weren't present in the original code. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "BCB17653","Code": "at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- carrying(key,T), at(robot,Pos,T).\nat(key,Pos,s(T)) :- at(key,Pos,T), \\+ carrying(key,s(T))."}
```

This implements the two required predicates:
1. The first rule states that if the robot is carrying the key at time T and is at position Pos, then the key is also at Pos at time s(T) (next time step).
2. The second rule states that if the key is at position Pos at time T and is not being carried at time s(T), then it remains at Pos at time s(T) (stationary when not carried).

The original code didn't include these key position rules, which are necessary to properly track the key's location based on whether it's being carried or not.
