{"HASH": "9BA21093","ErrorSummary": "The error occurs in the almost_equal predicate when comparing non-ground terms in the parse rules. The current implementation fails when Y is not ground in the arithmetic operations.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the parse rules to ensure both arguments are ground before comparison. Change the parse rules to first compute the result and then use almost_equal with ground terms. For example: parse([N1,+|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R_temp is N1 + R2, almost_equal(R, R_temp). Apply this pattern to all four operation rules.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
