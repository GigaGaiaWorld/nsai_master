{"HASH": "9BA21093", "ErrorSummary": "The error occurs in the almost_equal predicate when handling non-ground arguments in the arithmetic comparison. The current implementation fails when Y is not ground in the comparison abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.", "SuggestedFix": "Modify the almost_equal predicate to handle both ground and non-ground cases properly. The fix should ensure that arithmetic comparisons are only performed when both arguments are ground. Here's the corrected version:\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- \n    ground(X), ground(Y), \n    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- \n    var(Y), \n    Y is float(X).\nAlso modify the parse predicates to ensure proper grounding before arithmetic operations.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
