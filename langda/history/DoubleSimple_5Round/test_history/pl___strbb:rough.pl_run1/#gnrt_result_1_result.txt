Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, we need to define `bb(N)` to succeed when there exists consecutive 'b's in a random string of length N. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "0805B4F6","Code": "bb(N) :- between(1,N,I), I1 is I+1, I1 =< N, pick(I,b), pick(I1,b)."}
```

This implementation:
1. Uses `between(1,N,I)` to generate all possible indices I in 1..N
2. Calculates I+1 and checks it's within bounds
3. Requires both position I and I+1 to have character 'b'
4. Succeeds if any such pair exists

The original code was incomplete - it didn't implement the required check for consecutive 'b's. The new code properly implements the requirement by checking all possible consecutive pairs in the string.
