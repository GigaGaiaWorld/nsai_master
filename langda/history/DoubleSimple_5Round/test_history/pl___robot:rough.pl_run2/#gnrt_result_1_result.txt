Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, we need to define two at/3 predicates for the robot's movement success and failure cases. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "8EB675E6","Code": "at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_succeeds(T), do(goto(Pos),T).\nat(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_fails(T), at(robot,Pos,T)."}
```

This defines:
1. The first predicate handles the success case where the robot successfully moves to a new position
2. The second predicate handles the failure case where the robot stays in its current position when the goto action fails

The original code only had one at/3 predicate for the robot's position that didn't distinguish between success and failure cases, which didn't meet the requirements. The regenerated code properly separates these two cases.
