{"HASH": "35747D5A","ErrorSummary": "The query_sum predicate produces multiple solutions when it should have a unique solution. The current implementation allows invalid solutions where C (the hundreds digit of the sum) equals the carry from the tens addition (Cout2), which is incorrect for some cases.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the query_sum predicate to properly enforce the carry constraints and digit uniqueness. The corrected version should be:\n\nquery_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-\n    leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C),\n    sumdigit(0, B, B, D, Cout1),\n    sumdigit(Cout1, A, C, E, Cout2),\n    C = Cout2,\n    all_different([A,B,C,D,E]),\n    AB is 10*A + B,\n    BCD is 100*B + 10*C + D,\n    CDE is 100*C + 10*D + E,\n    AB + BCD =:= CDE.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
