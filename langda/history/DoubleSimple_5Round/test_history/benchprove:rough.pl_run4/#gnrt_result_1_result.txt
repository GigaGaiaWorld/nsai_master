Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to include all the specified extended logic processing predicates. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "2DFC0CFD", "Code": "implies(A,B) :- prove(A), prove(B).\nopposite(A) :- \\+ prove(A).\nexpand(Goal, Result) :- clause(Goal, Body), prove(Body), Result = Goal.\nincludes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).\nextend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).\nrefute(Goal) :- opposite(Goal)."}
```

This implementation:
1. `implies/2` proves both A and B
2. `opposite/1` succeeds when the goal cannot be proved
3. `expand/2` uses existing rules to expand a goal
4. `includes/2` checks if an element is in a list using member/2
5. `extend/2` adds an element to the head of a list
6. `refute/1` is simply an alias for opposite/1

The code maintains compatibility with the examples provided in the template.
