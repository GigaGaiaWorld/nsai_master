{"HASH": "5E40E418","ErrorSummary": "The sort operation implementation is incomplete and incorrect. The current implementation only sorts the top 3 elements and doesn't handle cases where the stack has fewer than 3 elements. Also, the insertion_sort predicate is not defined.","SuggestedFix": "Replace the sort operation implementation with:\nstack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :- \n    sort(Stack, SortedStack).\nThis uses Prolog's built-in sort/2 predicate which properly handles all cases. Remove the get_top_n and insertion_sort predicates as they're not needed.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
