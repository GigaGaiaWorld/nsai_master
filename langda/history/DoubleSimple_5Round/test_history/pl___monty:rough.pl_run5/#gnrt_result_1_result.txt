Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code for the open_door/1 predicate according to the specified conditions. Here's the complete regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "55F6DA26", "Code": "1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).\nselect_door(1).\nmember(X,[X|T]).\nmember(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).\n\nopen_door(D) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \\+ prize(X), X \\= Selected), Doors,\n    (   length(Doors, 2) ->\n        member(D, Doors),\n        0.5::open_door(D) ; 0.5::open_door(D)\n    ;   member(D, Doors)\n    ).\n\nwin_keep :-\n    select_door(A),\n    prize(A).\nwin_switch :-\n    member(A, [1,2,3]),\n    \\+ select_door(A),\n    prize(A),\n    \\+ open_door(A).\nquery(prize(_)).\nquery(select_door(_)).\nquery(win_keep).\nquery(win_switch)."}
```

The regenerated code includes:
1. The original probability definitions and helper predicates
2. A new implementation of open_door/1 that:
   - Finds all doors without prizes that aren't the selected door
   - If there are 2 such doors, chooses between them with equal probability (0.5)
   - If there's only 1 such door, must open it
3. Maintains all the original query predicates

The implementation uses findall to collect the eligible doors and then handles both cases (1 or 2 eligible doors) as specified in the requirements.
