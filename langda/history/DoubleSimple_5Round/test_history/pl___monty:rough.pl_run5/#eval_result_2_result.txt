{"HASH": "55F6DA26","ErrorSummary": "Syntax error in open_door/1 predicate due to unmatched parentheses and incorrect probability distribution handling","SuggestedFix": "Correct the syntax by properly closing the findall predicate and fixing the probability distribution logic. Here's the corrected version:\n\nopen_door(D) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \\+ prize(X), X \\= Selected), Doors),\n    (   length(Doors, 2) ->\n        member(D, Doors)\n    ;   member(D, Doors)\n    ).\n\nAlso, add probability annotations separately using the ProbLog syntax for probabilistic choices.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
