The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for the queries. The generated code simplifies some conditions in the 'open_door' rules but maintains the logical equivalence. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their consistency.
