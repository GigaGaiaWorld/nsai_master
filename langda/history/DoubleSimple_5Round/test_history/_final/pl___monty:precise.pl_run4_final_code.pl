The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the Monty Hall problem. Both codes correctly calculate the probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors. However, the generated code introduces an unused variable 'Selected' in the 'open_door' clauses, which is syntactically correct but unnecessary. The logic remains consistent with the original, ensuring the same outcomes.
