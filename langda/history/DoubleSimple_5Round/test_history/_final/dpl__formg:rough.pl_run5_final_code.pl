Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm and produces the same result as the original code. The main difference lies in the implementation of the 'split' function, which in the generated code splits the list by alternating elements, whereas the original code splits the list into two halves based on length. Despite this difference, both implementations correctly divide the list for sorting. The 'merge' function is identical in both codes and works as expected. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements.
