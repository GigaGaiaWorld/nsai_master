problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5. 

***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause 'coin(C)' which causes an error during execution. The original code uses 'coin(CNT)' which is properly grounded, while the generated code uses 'coin(C)' without proper instantiation. This leads to a runtime error. The generated code also incorrectly uses 'C' in the conditional statement where it should be using the result of the coin flip.
