The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It correctly implements the rock-paper-scissors game rules and computes the winner based on the moves provided. However, the generated code has redundant declarations of 'move' and 'beats' predicates, which were already defined in the original code. This redundancy does not affect the functionality but is unnecessary. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected output.
