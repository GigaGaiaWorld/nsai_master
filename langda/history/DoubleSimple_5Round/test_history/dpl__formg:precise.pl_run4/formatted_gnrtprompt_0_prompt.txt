System: You are a coding assistant.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 95E704F2 </HASH>
<Requirements>Should contain following rules: 1.Get the length of the current list, Len, to determine whether to continue splitting. 2.Recursive boundary judgment: Only lists with a length greater than 1 need to be sorted, otherwise they are sorted by default. 3.Split the list into two parts, Left and Right, for subsequent recursive processing. </Requirements></Langda>
,
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 26E82D5D </HASH>
<Requirements>Should contain following rules: 1.Recursively call merge sort on the left half, and the result is SortedLeft. 2.Recursively sort the right half, and the result is SortedRight. 3.Merge the two sorted sublists into the final sorted result Sorted. </Requirements></Langda>
.
split_list(List, Left, Right) :-
 length(List, Len),
 Half is Len // 2,
 length(Left, Half),
 append(Left, Right, List).
merge([], List, List).
merge(List, [], List).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H1|Merged]) :-
 H1 =< H2,
 merge(T1, [H2|T2], Merged).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H2|Merged]) :-
 H1 > H2,
 merge([H1|T1], T2, Merged).
 
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
