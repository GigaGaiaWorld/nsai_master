{"HASH": "0805B4F6","ErrorSummary": "The bb(N) predicate is incomplete and incorrectly defined. It should check for consecutive 'b's in any position, but the current implementation doesn't properly iterate through all possible positions. Also, the test result shows bb(5) = 1.0000 which is incorrect as the probability should be less than 1.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the bb(N) predicate to:\nbb(N) :-\n    between(1, N, I),\n    I < N,\n    pick(I, b),\n    pick(I+1, b).\nAlso ensure len(5) is properly defined before evidence and query calls.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
