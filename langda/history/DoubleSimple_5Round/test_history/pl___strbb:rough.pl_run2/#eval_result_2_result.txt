{"HASH": "0805B4F6","ErrorSummary": "The predicate bb(N) does not correctly implement the requirement to check for consecutive 'b's in a string of length N. The current implementation uses between/3 and additional arithmetic which is unnecessary and incorrect for the given requirement.","SuggestedFix": "Replace the current bb(N) definition with: bb(N) :- between(1, N, I), J is I+1, J =< N, pick(I, b), pick(J, b). This correctly checks for consecutive 'b's by iterating through each position and its successor.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
