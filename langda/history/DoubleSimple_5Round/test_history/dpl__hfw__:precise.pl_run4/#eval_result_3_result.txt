{"HASH": "9BA21093", "ErrorSummary": "The error occurs in the almost_equal predicate when handling non-ground arguments in arithmetic operations. The current implementation fails when Y is not ground in the second clause of almost_equal.", "SuggestedFix": "Modify the almost_equal predicate to handle both ground and non-ground cases properly. Replace the second clause with: 'almost_equal(X, Y) :- var(Y), Y = float(X).' and ensure all arithmetic operations are performed on ground values before comparison.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
