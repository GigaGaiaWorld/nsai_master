Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code snippet that calculates the attempted flap position based on previous position, actuator used, and wind effect. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A5C06F43","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),\n \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n use_actuator(Time,Actuator),\n actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),\n wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),\n Target is PrevPos - 2,\n Pos is Target + Strength + WindEffect."}
```

This code:
1. Takes the previous flap position
2. Checks if goal hasn't been reached yet
3. Gets the actuator being used and its strength
4. Incorporates wind effect
5. Calculates the target position (2 steps left from initial position 6)
6. Computes the new attempted position by combining these factors

The original code was incomplete and didn't show how to calculate the new position based on all required factors. This regeneration implements the full calculation as specified in the requirements.
