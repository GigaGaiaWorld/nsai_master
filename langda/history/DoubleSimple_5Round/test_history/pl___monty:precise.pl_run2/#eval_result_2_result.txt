{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","ErrorSummary": "The open_door/1 rule is incomplete and incorrectly structured. The current implementation doesn't properly handle the case where there are two empty doors available for the host to choose from.","SuggestedFix": "Replace the current open_door/1 rule with a complete implementation that correctly handles both cases (when one or two empty doors are available). The fix should include proper conditions for when there's only one empty door versus when there are two empty doors (where the host chooses randomly).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}

{"HASH": "GLOBAL","ErrorSummary": "The overall implementation produces correct probabilities for win_keep and win_switch, matching the expected Monty Hall problem solution (1/3 for keeping, 2/3 for switching). However, the implementation could be clearer.","SuggestedFix": "Consider restructuring the code to make the host's door selection logic more explicit and separated from the prize selection. The current implementation works but is somewhat convoluted.","Dependencies": ["A4F0EAE2"],"NeedRegenerate": false}
