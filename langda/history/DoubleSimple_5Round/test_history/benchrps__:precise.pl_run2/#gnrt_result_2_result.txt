Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the `determine_winner` predicate to properly calculate the winner by comparing the moves and computing the final score. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CE4B5362","Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), compute_score(Results,Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw')."}
```

This implementation:
1. Calls `play/3` to compare the moves and generate Results
2. Computes the total score using `compute_score/2`
3. Determines the winner based on whether the score is positive (Player 1 wins), negative (Player 2 wins), or zero (Draw)
4. Matches the query format shown in the example
