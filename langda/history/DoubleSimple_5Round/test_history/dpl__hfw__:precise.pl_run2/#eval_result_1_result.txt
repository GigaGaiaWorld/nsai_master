{"HASH": "9BA21093","ErrorSummary": "The error occurs in the almost_equal predicate when handling non-ground variables in arithmetic operations. The current implementation fails when comparing expressions involving multiplication/division before subtraction/addition due to order of operations.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the parse predicates to ensure proper order of operations (PEMDAS) and handle ground/non-ground cases correctly. The fix should include:\n1. Adding parentheses handling in parse/2\n2. Ensuring all arithmetic operations are performed on ground values before comparison\n3. Restructuring the parse rules to handle operator precedence correctly","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
