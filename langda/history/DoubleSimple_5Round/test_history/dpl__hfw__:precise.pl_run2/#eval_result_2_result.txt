{"HASH": "9BA21093", "ErrorSummary": "The error occurs in the almost_equal predicate when handling non-ground arguments in the arithmetic comparison. The current implementation fails when Y is not ground in the first clause.", "SuggestedFix": "Modify the almost_equal predicate to handle both ground and non-ground cases properly. Replace the existing almost_equal definition with:\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- \n    (ground(Y) -> abs(X - Y) < 0.0001; Y is float(X)).", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
