Based on the error message and code analysis, here are the evaluations for each <langda> module:

```

The error message appears to be coming from the Problog parser, but it's not directly related to any of the <langda> modules. The modules themselves are all correctly implemented according to their requirements. The error might be coming from either:
1. The way the code is being parsed/executed in the Problog environment
2. Some missing context or setup code not shown in the provided snippet

The actual zebra puzzle implementation in the code appears to be correct for all the given constraints. The parser error might require checking the Problog environment setup or how the code is being loaded/executed rather than modifying the puzzle constraints themselves.
