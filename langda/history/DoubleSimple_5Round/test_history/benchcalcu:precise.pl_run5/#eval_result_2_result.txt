The test results show 10 valid solutions, indicating the constraints are not strict enough to enforce uniqueness.","SuggestedFix": "Add additional constraints to ensure uniqueness, such as checking that AB + BCD equals CDE numerically. Modify the query_sum predicate to include: AB is 10*A + B, BCD is 100*B + 10*C + D, CDE is 100*C + 10*D + E, Sum is AB + BCD, Sum =:= CDE.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
