Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, the code needs to be regenerated to properly sample CNT independent coins and accumulate the number of heads. The current code is incomplete and doesn't implement the coin tossing logic. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","Code": "coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :- CNT > 0, coin(C), (C -> NSC is SC + 1; NSC is SC), NCNT is CNT - 1, coins_r(NSC,S,NCNT)."}
```

This implementation:
1. Takes the current head count SC, final count S, and remaining coins CNT
2. When CNT > 0, samples a coin C
3. If C is heads (true), increments the head count
4. Decrements the remaining coin count and recurses
5. Base case (coins_r(SC,SC,0)) handles when no coins remain

The code now properly accumulates the number of heads from tossing CNT independent coins with 0.8 probability of heads each.
