The main error in the code appears to be a parsing error at the top level (line 35:1), likely due to incorrect syntax or structure in the main query_sum predicate definition. The individual modules are mostly correct except for the hundreds digit calculation which needs adjustment. The parsing error might be resolved by properly formatting the predicate definition and ensuring all clauses are correctly terminated.
