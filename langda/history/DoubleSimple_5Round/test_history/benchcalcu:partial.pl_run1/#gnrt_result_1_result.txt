Based on the requirements in each <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code snippets:

1. For the first block (HASH F91C6038) which needs to define digits and ensure first digit is non-zero:
```problog
{"HASH": "F91C6038","Code": "leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C), digit(D), digit(E),"}
```

2. For the second block (HASH A8860BE4) which needs to compute units digit:
```problog
{"HASH": "A8860BE4","Code": "sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Cout1),"}
```

3. For the third block (HASH 57FD427B) which needs to compute hundreds digit:
```problog
{"HASH": "57FD427B","Code": "sumdigit(Cout1, A, B, C, Cout2),"}
```
