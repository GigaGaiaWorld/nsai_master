System: You are a coding assistant.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

<Requirements>Define two at/3 predicates (they have three parameters: key, position and time), they describe respectively:  If at the same moment T the robot is "carrying" the key (carrying(key, T) is true) and the robot is at position Pos, then the key is also at that position Pos. In other words: as long as the robot is holding the key, the key and the robot always move in sync.  If at time s(T) (the next time step) the robot does not have the key, then at s(T) the key is stationary. </Requirements></Langda>

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
</Regenerate_Instructions>
<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
