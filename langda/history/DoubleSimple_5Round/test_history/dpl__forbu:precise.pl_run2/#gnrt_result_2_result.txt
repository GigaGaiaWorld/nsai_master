Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly implement the bubblesort algorithm by recursively calling bubblesort on L2 and putting the current maximum value X into the sorted part [X|L3]. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "2971FD2F","Code": "bubblesort([X|L1],L3,Sorted) :- bubble([X|L1],L2,X), bubblesort(L2,[X|L3],Sorted)."}
```

The regenerated code completes the bubblesort predicate by:
1. Calling bubble/3 to perform one pass of bubbling through the list
2. Taking the resulting maximum element X and adding it to the sorted part [X|L3]
3. Recursively calling bubblesort on the remaining list L2
This implements the classic bubble sort algorithm in Prolog style.
