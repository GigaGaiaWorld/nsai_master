Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to regenerate the bubblesort predicate to recursively call bubblesort on L2 and put the current maximum value X into the sorted part [X|L3]. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "2971FD2F","Code": "bubblesort([X|L],L3,Sorted) :- bubble([X|L],L2,X), bubblesort(L2,[X|L3],Sorted)."}
```

The original code was incomplete and didn't properly implement the recursive sorting process. The regenerated code:
1. Takes the current list [X|L]
2. Uses bubble/3 to find the maximum element X and the remaining list L2
3. Recursively calls bubblesort on L2 while accumulating the sorted elements in [X|L3]
4. The base case (empty list) is already provided in the original code
