Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the `bb(N)` predicate to correctly implement the specified functionality. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "FA856BCD","Code": "bb(N) :- Max is N-1, between(1,Max,I), pick(I,b), pick(I+1,b)."}
```

This implementation:
1. Calculates Max as N-1 (the maximum starting position for a pair)
2. Uses `between/3` to enumerate all positions I from 1 to Max
3. For each I, checks if both position I and I+1 have character 'b'
4. Succeeds if any such pair is found

The original code was incomplete, missing the actual implementation of the `bb(N)` predicate. The regenerated version now properly implements the required functionality according to the specifications.
