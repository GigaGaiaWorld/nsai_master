Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, the current code needs to be regenerated to properly handle the case where there are two empty doors (neither selected nor containing the prize) and the host randomly chooses one to open. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A,[1,2,3]),\n    member(B,[1,2,3]),\n    A < B,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ select_door(B)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Ensures we only consider pairs where A < B to avoid duplicate cases
2. Properly handles the case where both A and B are empty doors (no prize and not selected)
3. Gives equal probability (0.5) to opening either door when two empty doors are available
4. Maintains the original requirements of the Monty Hall problem while fixing the random door selection logic
