{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","ErrorSummary": "The rule for open_door/1 is incomplete and incorrectly structured. The current implementation doesn't properly handle the case where there's only one unselected, non-prize door available.","SuggestedFix": "Replace the current open_door/1 rule with:\n\nopen_door(A) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A,[1,2,3]),\n    \\+ prize(A),\n    \\+ select_door(A),\n    \\+ (member(OtherDoor,[1,2,3]),\n        OtherDoor \\= A,\n        OtherDoor \\= Selected,\n        \\+ prize(OtherDoor)).\n\nAnd ensure the probabilistic rule for open_door/2 handles the case when two doors are available correctly.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
