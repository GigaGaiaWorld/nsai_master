Based on the requirements, I'll regenerate the code for the `determine_winner` predicate in the <langda> block. The current code is incomplete and needs to properly calculate the winner by comparing scores from the game results.

```problog
{"HASH": "CE4B5362","Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), compute_score(Results,Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw')."}
```

This regenerated code:
1. Calls play/3 to get the Results list comparing P1Moves and P2Moves
2. Computes the total score using compute_score/2
3. Determines the winner based on whether the score is positive (Player 1 wins), negative (Player 2 wins), or zero (Draw)
4. Matches the example query format shown in the requirements
