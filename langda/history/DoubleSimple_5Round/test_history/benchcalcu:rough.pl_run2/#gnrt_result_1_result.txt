Based on the requirements, I'll regenerate the code for the cryptoaddition puzzle AB + BCD = CDE. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "35747D5A","Code": "leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C), digit(D), digit(E), all_different([A,B,C,D,E]), sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Carry1), sumdigit(Carry1, A, C, D, Carry2), sumdigit(Carry2, 0, B, C, _)."}
```

This code:
1. Ensures A, B, and C are non-zero digits (left digits)
2. Allows D and E to be any digits
3. Ensures all letters represent different digits
4. Models the column-wise addition with carry propagation for AB + BCD = CDE
5. The three sumdigit calls represent the addition from right to left (units, tens, hundreds places)
6. The final carry is ignored with _ as it's not needed for this 3-digit result
