{"HASH": "55F6DA26","ErrorSummary": "Syntax error in the open_door/1 predicate definition. The arrow operators (->) are not properly formatted and the predicate lacks proper structure.","SuggestedFix": "Rewrite the open_door/1 predicate with proper syntax for conditional statements. Here's the corrected version:\n\nopen_door(D) :- \n    select_door(S), \n    prize(P), \n    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X\\=S, X\\=P), Doors), \n    length(Doors, L), \n    (L=2 -> \n        random_member(D, Doors) ; \n    L=1 -> \n        Doors=[D]\n    ).\n\nAlso ensure the random_member/2 predicate is defined or imported.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
