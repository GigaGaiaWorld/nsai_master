Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code for the open_door/1 predicate according to the Monty Hall problem specifications. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "55F6DA26","Code": "open_door(D) :- select_door(S), prize(P), findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X\\=S, X\\=P), Doors), length(Doors, L), (L=2 -> member(D, Doors) ; L=1 -> Doors=[D])."}
```

This implementation:
1. Finds all doors that are not selected and don't have a prize
2. Checks how many such doors exist (length)
3. If there are 2 such doors (L=2), randomly selects one
4. If there's only 1 such door (L=1), must select it

The code follows the exact requirements specified in the <Requirements> section of the <langda> block.
