Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly handle the case when both unselected doors are empty (no prize) by opening one of them randomly. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "C5B4A895","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :- select_door(Selected), member(A,[1,2,3]), A \\= Selected, \\+ prize(A), member(B,[1,2,3]), B \\= Selected, B \\= A, \\+ prize(B)."}
```

This code ensures that when there are two empty doors not selected by the player, the host will randomly open one of them with equal probability (50/50 chance). The code checks that:
1. Both doors A and B are different from the selected door
2. Neither door A nor B has the prize
3. Doors A and B are different from each other
4. Then randomly chooses between them with equal probability
