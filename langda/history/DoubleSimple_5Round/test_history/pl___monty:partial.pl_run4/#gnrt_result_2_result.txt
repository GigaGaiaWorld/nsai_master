Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly handle the case when both unselected doors are empty (no prize) by randomly opening one of them. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "C5B4A895","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A,[1,2,3]),\n    member(B,[1,2,3]),\n    A \\= Selected,\n    B \\= Selected,\n    A \\= B,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B)."}
```

This code modification ensures that:
1. When both remaining doors (A and B) are empty (no prize)
2. And neither is the selected door
3. Then it randomly chooses between them with equal probability (0.5 for each)
4. The original conditions about door selection and prize location are maintained

The new code properly implements the requirement to randomly open one of the empty doors when both unselected doors are empty.
