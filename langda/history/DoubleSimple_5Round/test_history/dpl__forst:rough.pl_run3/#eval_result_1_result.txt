{"HASH": "5E40E418","ErrorSummary": "The code only implements 'sort' operation but queries test other unimplemented operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot). All queries return 0 probability due to missing implementations.","SuggestedFix": "1. Implement missing stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) as additional clauses for stack_op/3. 2. Alternatively, remove queries for unimplemented operations if they're not needed.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
