Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly implement the coin counting logic where the success count SC increases by 1 when a coin turns up heads, and remains unchanged otherwise, while decrementing the counter until it reaches 0.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "EA5E8D55","Code": "PH::make_coin(C,PH).\ncoin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n (coin(CNT) ->\n  SC1 is SC + 1,\n  coins_r(SC1,S,CNT1)\n ;\n  coins_r(SC,S,CNT1)\n ).\ntotal(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).\nquery(total(_))."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Properly handles the coin toss for each CNT value
2. Increments SC only when the coin turns up heads (using the probabilistic coin/1 predicate)
3. Recursively processes all coins until CNT reaches 0
4. Maintains the same interface with total/1 and query/1 predicates
5. Uses the same probability (0.8) for coin tosses as in the original code
