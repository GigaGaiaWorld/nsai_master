```

The main error in the code appears to be a syntax error in the determine_winner predicate where the clause is missing its terminating period. This is causing the "No clauses found" error when trying to evaluate the query. The fix is simply to add the missing period at the end of the determine_winner clause.

The other modules (D324979D and FD850DEC) are correctly implemented and don't require any changes. They properly handle the score calculation for lose and draw outcomes respectively.
