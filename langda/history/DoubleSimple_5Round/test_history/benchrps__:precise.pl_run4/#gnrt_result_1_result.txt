Based on the requirements, I'll regenerate the code for the <langda> block. The current code is incomplete and needs to implement the `determine_winner` predicate properly by using the `play` and `compute_score` predicates.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CE4B5362","Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), compute_score(Results,Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw')."}
```

This implementation:
1. Uses `play/3` to compare the moves and generate Results
2. Uses `compute_score/2` to calculate the total score
3. Determines the winner based on whether the score is positive (Player 1 wins), negative (Player 2 wins), or zero (Draw)
