Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to regenerate the parse/2 predicate to handle arithmetic operations in a list format, with each operation as a separate rule. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "FB41E2F7","Code": "parse([N, '+', M | T], R) :- R1 is N + M, parse([R1 | T], R).\nparse([N, '-', M | T], R) :- R1 is N - M, parse([R1 | T], R).\nparse([N, '*', M | T], R) :- R1 is N * M, parse([R1 | T], R).\nparse([N, '/', M | T], R) :- R1 is N / M, parse([R1 | T], R)."}
```

This implementation:
1. Defines separate parse/2 rules for each arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /)
2. Handles operations in left-associative order by recursively processing the list
3. Uses intermediate results (R1) to accumulate the computation
4. Maintains compatibility with the almost_equal/2 predicate for floating point comparisons
