{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","ErrorSummary": "The rule correctly implements the Monty Hall problem's host behavior when two empty doors are available. However, the probability distribution could be made more explicit by ensuring A and B are distinct and valid doors.","SuggestedFix": "The current implementation is correct but could be clarified by adding explicit checks for A \\= B and ensuring both are valid doors (1,2,3).
