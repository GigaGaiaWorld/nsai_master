<HASH> Hash tag of code: A4F0EAE2 </HASH>
<Requirements>If there are two doors that are not selected and neither of them hides a prize  Let the two doors be numbered A and B (and A < B ensures that each pair is counted only once).  When faced with two empty doors, the host randomly and fairly chooses one to open. </Requirements></Langda>

<HASH> Hash tag of code: F0FDE8AB </HASH>
<Requirements>If only one door is not selected and does not contain a prize.   This means that the other unselected door is exactly the one that contains the prize.  Then this rule will match the only empty door A and open it with certainty (probability 1). </Requirements></Langda>

win_keep :-
 select_door(A),
 prize(A).
win_switch :-
 member(A, [1,2,3]),
 \+ select_door(A),

query(prize(_)).
query(select_door(_)).
query(win_keep).
query(win_switch).
<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
</Result> 
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
