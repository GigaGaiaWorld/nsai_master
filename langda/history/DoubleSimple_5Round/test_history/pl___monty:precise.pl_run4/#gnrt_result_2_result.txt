Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, the current code needs to be regenerated to properly handle the case where there are two unselected doors without prizes, and the host randomly chooses one to open. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A,[1,2,3]),\n    member(B,[1,2,3]),\n    A < B,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ select_door(B)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Ensures A < B to count each pair only once
2. Properly handles the case where there are two unselected doors without prizes
3. Gives each door a 50% chance of being opened in this scenario
4. Maintains all the necessary conditions (not selected, no prize)
