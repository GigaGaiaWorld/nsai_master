Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, the current code needs to be regenerated to properly handle the case where there are two unselected doors without prizes, and the host randomly chooses one to open. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A,[1,2,3]),\n    member(B,[1,2,3]),\n    A < B,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ select_door(B)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Ensures we consider pairs of doors A and B where A < B to avoid duplicate cases
2. Both doors must be unselected and not have prizes
3. When these conditions are met, the host randomly chooses between them with equal probability
4. Removes the incorrect condition that was preventing proper handling of the two-empty-doors case
