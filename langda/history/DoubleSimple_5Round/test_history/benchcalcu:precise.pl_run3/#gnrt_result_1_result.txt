Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code for the cryptarithmetic puzzle AB + BCD = CDE. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "623E07CC","Code": "query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :- leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C), digit(D), digit(E), all_different([A,B,C,D,E]), sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Carry1), sumdigit(Carry1, A, C, D, Carry2), sumdigit(Carry2, 0, B, C, _)."}
```

This code:
1. Ensures A, B, and C are left digits (can't be 0)
2. Makes all letters represent different digits
3. Performs the column-wise addition with proper carry handling for AB + BCD = CDE
4. Matches the structure of the original problem while implementing all requirements
