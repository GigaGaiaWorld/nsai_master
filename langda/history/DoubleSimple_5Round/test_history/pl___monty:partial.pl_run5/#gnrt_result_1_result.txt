Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, the code needs to be regenerated to handle the case when both unselected doors are empty (no prize) by opening one of them randomly. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "C5B4A895","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :- select_door(Selected), member(A,[1,2,3]), A \\= Selected, member(B,[1,2,3]), B \\= Selected, A \\= B, \\+ prize(A), \\+ prize(B)."}
```

This code modification ensures that:
1. When both remaining unselected doors are empty (no prize)
2. The host will randomly open one of them with equal probability (0.5 for each)
3. The selection is made between two distinct doors (A and B) that are not the initially selected door
