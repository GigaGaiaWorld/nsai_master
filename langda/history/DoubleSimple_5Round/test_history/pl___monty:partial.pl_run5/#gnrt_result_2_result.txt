Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, I'll regenerate the code portion that handles opening a door when both unselected doors are empty. The current code needs to be modified to ensure that when both unselected doors don't have the prize, one is opened randomly with equal probability.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "C5B4A895","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A,[1,2,3]), A \\= Selected, \\+ prize(A),\n    member(B,[1,2,3]), B \\= Selected, B \\= A, \\+ prize(B)."}
```

This code ensures that:
1. When there are two empty doors (neither has the prize) that weren't selected
2. It randomly opens one of them with 50% probability for each
3. The conditions properly check that both doors are different from the selected door and from each other
4. Neither of the doors being considered has the prize
