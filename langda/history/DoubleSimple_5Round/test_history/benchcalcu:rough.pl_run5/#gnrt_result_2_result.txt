Based on the requirements, I'll regenerate the code for the cryptoaddition puzzle AB + BCD = CDE. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "35747D5A","Code": "leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C), digit(D), digit(E), all_different([A,B,C,D,E]), sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Cout1), sumdigit(Cout1, A, C, D, Cout2), sumdigit(Cout2, 0, B, C, _)."}
```

This code:
1. Ensures A, B, and C are non-zero digits (leftdigit)
2. Allows D and E to be any digits
3. Enforces all letters represent different digits
4. Models the column-wise addition with carry for AB + BCD = CDE:
   - First column (units): B + D = E
   - Second column (tens): A + C = D (with carry from first column)
   - Third column (hundreds): 0 + B = C (with carry from second column)
