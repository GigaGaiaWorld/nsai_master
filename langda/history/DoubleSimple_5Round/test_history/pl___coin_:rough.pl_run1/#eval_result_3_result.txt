{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","ErrorSummary": "The coin/1 predicate incorrectly uses CNT as the coin identifier instead of a unique identifier, and the recursive cases have incorrect probability handling","SuggestedFix": "Modify the code as follows:\n1. Change 'coin(CNT)' to 'coin(C)' and add a unique coin identifier system\n2. Fix the probability handling in the recursive cases\n3.
