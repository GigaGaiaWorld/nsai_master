Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly sample CNT independent coins and accumulate the number of heads. The current code is incomplete and doesn't implement the coin tossing logic.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","Code": "PH::make_coin(C,PH).\ncoin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n coin(CNT),\n (make_coin(CNT,PH) -> NewSC is SC + 1; NewSC = SC),\n CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n coins_r(NewSC,S,CNT1).\ntotal(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).\nquery(total(_))."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Keeps the same base definitions for coins
2. Properly implements the recursive coins_r predicate to:
   - Sample each coin (CNT)
   - Check if it lands heads (using make_coin)
   - Increment the head count if it does
   - Decrement the counter and recurse
3. Maintains the same interface with total/1 and query
