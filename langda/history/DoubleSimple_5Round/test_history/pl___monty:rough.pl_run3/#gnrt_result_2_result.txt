Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly implement the `open_door/1` predicate according to the Monty Hall problem rules. Here's the complete regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "55F6DA26","Code": "1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).\nselect_door(1).\nmember(X,[X|T]).\nmember(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).\n\nopen_door(D) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X\\=Selected, \+prize(X)), AvailableDoors),\n    (   length(AvailableDoors, 2) ->\n        member(D, AvailableDoors)\n    ;   AvailableDoors = [D]\n    ).\n\nwin_keep :-\n    select_door(A),\n    prize(A).\nwin_switch :-\n    member(A, [1,2,3]),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    prize(A),\n    \+ open_door(A).\nquery(prize(_)).\nquery(select_door(_)).\nquery(win_keep).\nquery(win_switch)."}
```

The key changes are:
1. Added the `open_door/1` predicate that implements both required clauses:
   - When there are two available doors (neither has prize nor is selected), it chooses one uniformly at random
   - When there's only one available door, it must choose that one
2. Kept all other existing predicates and queries unchanged
3. Removed all comments as instructed

The implementation uses `findall/3` to collect available doors and then checks the length to determine which case applies.
