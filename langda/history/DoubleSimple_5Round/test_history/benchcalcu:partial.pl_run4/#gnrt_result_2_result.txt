Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, I'll regenerate the code portion that defines the digits and ensures the first digit is non-zero. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "F91C6038","Code": "leftdigit(A). leftdigit(B). leftdigit(C). digit(D). digit(E)."}
```

This code ensures that:
1. The first digits (A, B, C) of each number cannot be zero by using leftdigit/1
2. Other digits (D, E) can be any digit including zero
3. Matches the cryptarithmetic puzzle structure where AB, BCD, and CDE are all valid numbers (with leading digits non-zero)
