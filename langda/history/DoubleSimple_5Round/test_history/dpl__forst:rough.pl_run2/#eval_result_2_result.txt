{"HASH": "5E40E418","ErrorSummary": "The sort operation implementation is incomplete and incorrect. The current implementation tries to sort only the top 3 elements and doesn't match the expected behavior of sorting the entire stack. Also, the insertion_sort predicate is not defined.","SuggestedFix": "Replace the current sort implementation with a complete one that sorts the entire stack:\nstack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :- \n    sort(Stack, SortedStack).\nAlso remove the get_top_n predicate as it's not needed for the correct implementation.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
