Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to add two `at/3` predicates for the key's position that weren't present in the original code. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "BCB17653","Code": "at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- carrying(key,T), at(robot,Pos,T).\nat(key,Pos,s(T)) :- \+ carrying(key,s(T)), at(key,Pos,T)."}
```

This implements the two required predicates:
1. The first rule states that if the robot is carrying the key at time T and is at position Pos, then the key is also at Pos (they move together).
2. The second rule states that if the robot is not carrying the key at the next time step s(T), then the key stays where it was (stationary).

The original code was missing these key position rules entirely, which were necessary to properly model the key's movement behavior in relation to the robot.
