Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to add two `at/3` predicates for the key's position that weren't present in the original code. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "BCB17653","Code": "at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- carrying(key,T), at(robot,Pos,T).\nat(key,Pos,s(T)) :- \\+ carrying(key,s(T)), at(key,Pos,T)."}
```

The first rule implements the requirement that when the robot is carrying the key, the key's position matches the robot's position. The second rule implements that when the robot isn't carrying the key at the next time step, the key stays where it was (stationary). These rules complement the existing `at/3` predicates for the robot's position.
