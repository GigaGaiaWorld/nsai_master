Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, we need to define two at/3 predicates for the robot's movement success and failure cases. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "8EB675E6","Code": "at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_succeeds(T), do(goto(Pos),T).\nat(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_fails(T), at(robot,Pos,T).\n\n0.9::goto_succeeds(T); 0.1::goto_fails(T)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Defines two separate cases for at/3 predicate for the robot:
   - First case handles successful goto action
   - Second case handles failed goto action (robot stays in same position)
2. Keeps the probabilistic facts for goto success/failure
3. Maintains the same hash for tracking purposes
4. Removes all comments as requested
