{"HASH": "8EB675E6","ErrorSummary": "The goto_action/1 predicate is defined incorrectly, causing all goto actions to be considered as happening at all time points. Also, the at/3 predicate for the key's position when not carried should check the current time step (s(T)) rather than the next time step.","SuggestedFix": "1. Modify the goto_action/1 predicate to only be true when a goto action is actually performed at time T. 2. Change the at(key,Pos,s(T)) predicate to check carrying(key,T) instead of carrying(key,s(T)).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
