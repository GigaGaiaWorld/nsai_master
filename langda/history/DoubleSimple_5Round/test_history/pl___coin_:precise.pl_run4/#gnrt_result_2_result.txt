Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly implement the coin counting logic where the success count SC increases by 1 when a coin turns up heads, and remains unchanged otherwise, with the counter decreasing to 0.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "EA5E8D55", "Code": "coin_flip(C,1) :- coin(C).\ncoin_flip(C,0) :- \+ coin(C).\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n    CNT > 0,\n    CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n    coin_flip(CNT,Result),\n    NewSC is SC + Result,\n    coins_r(NewSC,S,CNT1)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Adds a coin_flip/2 predicate to determine if a coin flip results in head (1) or tail (0)
2. Properly implements the recursive counting:
   - Decrements the counter each recursion
   - Adds 1 to SC if the coin is heads, 0 otherwise
   - Continues recursion until CNT reaches 0
3. Maintains the same interface with the total/1 predicate and query
