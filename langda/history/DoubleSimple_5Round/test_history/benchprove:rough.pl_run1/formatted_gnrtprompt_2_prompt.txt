System: You are a coding assistant.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Regenerate_format>
% member/2 for ProbLog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
% --------- Basic meta-interpreter ---------
% Prove "true" always succeeds
prove(true).
prove(Goal) :-
	% For all other goals, use the clause/2 facts/rules defined in the program
	clause(Goal, Body),
	prove(Body).
% Prove compound goal A,B: prove A first, then prove B
prove((A,B)) :-
	prove(A),
	prove(B).
% --------- Extended logic processing ---------
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 2DFC0CFD </HASH>
<Requirements>Extended define multiple prove/1 logic processing predicates, which should contain: 	1.implies/2 	2.opposite/1 	3.expand/2 (use already defined rules) 	4.includes/2 	5.extend/2(add Elem to the head of List) 	6.refute/1 </Requirements></Langda>
.
% --------- Examples ---------- %
% Define some expand rules:
expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.
expand(square(X), Y) :- Y is X*X.
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, carol).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y).
% --------- Queries ---------- %
query(prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))).
query(prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))).
query(prove(expand(double(3),6))).
query(prove(includes([a,b,c],b))).
query(prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))).

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
</Regenerate_Instructions>
<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
