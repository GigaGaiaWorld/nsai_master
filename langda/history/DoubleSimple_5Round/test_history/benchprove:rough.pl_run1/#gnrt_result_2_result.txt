Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to include all the specified extended logic processing predicates. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "2DFC0CFD","Code": "% --------- Extended logic processing ---------\nimplies(A, B) :- A, B.\nopposite(A) :- \\+ A.\nexpand(Goal, Result) :- call(Goal, Result).\nincludes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).\nextend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).\nrefute(Goal) :- \\+ Goal."}
```

This implementation includes:
1. implies/2 - succeeds if both A and B can be proven
2. opposite/1 - succeeds if A cannot be proven (negation)
3. expand/2 - uses call/2 to evaluate goals that produce results
4. includes/2 - checks if Elem is a member of List
5. extend/2 - adds Elem to the head of List (note this is actually extend/3 to match the example query)
6. refute/1 - succeeds if Goal cannot be proven (same as opposite but with different name)

Note that the extend/2 in the requirements appears to be extend/3 in the example query, so I've implemented it as extend/3 to match the usage in the query.
