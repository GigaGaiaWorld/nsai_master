Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to include all the specified extended logic processing predicates. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "2DFC0CFD","Code": "% --------- Extended logic processing ---------\nimplies(A,B) :- prove(A), prove(B).\nopposite(A) :- \\+ prove(A).\nexpand(Goal, Result) :- clause(Goal, Body), prove(Body), Result = Goal.\nincludes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).\nextend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).\nrefute(Goal) :- opposite(Goal)."}
```

The regenerated code includes:
1. implies/2 - succeeds if both A and B can be proved
2. opposite/1 - succeeds if the goal cannot be proved (negation)
3. expand/2 - uses existing rules to expand a goal
4. includes/2 - checks if an element is in a list (using member/2)
5. extend/2 - adds an element to the head of a list
6. refute/1 - alias for opposite/1

All predicates are implemented according to the requirements while maintaining Prolog syntax and compatibility with the existing code structure.
