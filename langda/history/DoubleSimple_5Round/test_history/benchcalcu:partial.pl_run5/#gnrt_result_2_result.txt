Based on the requirements in each <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code snippets for computing the units, tens, and hundreds digits in the cryptarithmetic puzzle AB + BCD = CDE.

For the units digit (A8860BE4):
```problog
{"HASH": "A8860BE4","Code": "sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Cout1)."}
```

For the tens digit (702CD838):
```problog
{"HASH": "702CD838","Code": "sumdigit(Cout1, A, C, D, Cout2)."}
```

For the hundreds digit (57FD427B):
```problog
{"HASH": "57FD427B","Code": "sumdigit(Cout2, 0, B, C, _)."}
```

These regenerated code snippets:
1. Compute the units digit (E) by adding B and D with initial carry 0
2. Compute the tens digit (D) by adding A and C with carry from units addition
3. Compute the hundreds digit (C) by adding 0 and B with carry from tens addition
The final carry is ignored as we don't need it for this 3-digit result.
