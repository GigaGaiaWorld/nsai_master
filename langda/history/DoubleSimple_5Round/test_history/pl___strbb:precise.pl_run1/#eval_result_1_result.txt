{"HASH": "FA856BCD","ErrorSummary": "The predicate bb(N) is incomplete and incorrectly formatted in the original code block (missing body before Max is N-1). Also, the test result shows bb(5) = 1.0000 which is unexpected since the probability should be less than 1 for adjacent b's in a 5-length string.","SuggestedFix": "1. Fix the bb(N) predicate formatting by removing the line break before Max is N-1. 2. Correct the probability calculation by ensuring the query properly evaluates the probability of adjacent b's (which should be 0.5*0.5 = 0.25 per pair, with multiple possible pairs).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
