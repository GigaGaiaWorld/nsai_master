Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the `bb(N)` predicate to check for adjacent 'b' characters in a string of length N. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "FA856BCD", "Code": "bb(N) :- Max is N-1, between(1,Max,I), pick(I,b), pick(I+1,b)."}
```

This implementation:
1. Calculates the maximum starting position as N-1 (since we're checking pairs)
2. Uses `between/3` to enumerate all positions I from 1 to Max
3. For each position I, checks if both position I and I+1 have character 'b'
4. Succeeds if any such pair is found

The original code was incomplete (cut off after `bb(N) :-`), so this completes it according to the specified requirements.
