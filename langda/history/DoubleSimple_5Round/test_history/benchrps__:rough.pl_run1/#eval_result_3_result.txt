{"HASH": "CFA63C1E","ErrorSummary": "The game_result predicate incorrectly returns 'draw' when both players make the same move, but the current implementation returns 'draw' in all other cases where neither player beats the other. This is logically correct but could be made more explicit.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the game_result predicate to explicitly check for equal moves: game_result(X, X, draw). and keep the other two clauses for win/lose. This makes the intention clearer.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}

```report
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E","ErrorSummary": "The test result shows 'draw' as the outcome when it should be 'player2' wins (since player2 wins 2 rounds and loses 1). This indicates an error in the compute_score or determine_winner logic.","SuggestedFix": "The compute_score predicate is correct, but the determine_winner predicate needs to be checked. The current implementation correctly compares the score S, but the test case suggests the play predicate might not be generating the correct Results list. Verify the play predicate's results generation.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
