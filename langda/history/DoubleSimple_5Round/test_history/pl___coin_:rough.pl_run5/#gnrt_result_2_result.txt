Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, the code needs to be regenerated to properly sample CNT independent coins and accumulate the number of heads. The current code is incomplete and doesn't implement the coin tossing logic. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","Code": "coins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n    CNT > 0,\n    coin(C),\n    (C -> NSC is SC + 1; NSC is SC),\n    NCNT is CNT - 1,\n    coins_r(NSC,S,NCNT)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Keeps the base case where when CNT=0, S=SC
2. For the recursive case:
   - Checks that CNT > 0
   - Samples a coin toss (coin(C))
   - Increments the head count if the toss is heads (C is true)
   - Decrements the counter
   - Recursively continues the process
