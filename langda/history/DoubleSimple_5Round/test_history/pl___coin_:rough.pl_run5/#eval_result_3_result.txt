{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","ErrorSummary": "Non-ground probabilistic clause in coin/1 definition and missing probabilistic handling in coins_r/3","SuggestedFix": "1. Replace 'PH::make_coin(C,PH)' with a concrete probability like '0.8::make_coin(C)'. 2. Ensure all probabilistic facts are properly grounded by modifying the coin/1 definition to use a concrete probability. 3. The coins_r/3 predicate should handle probabilistic outcomes properly.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
