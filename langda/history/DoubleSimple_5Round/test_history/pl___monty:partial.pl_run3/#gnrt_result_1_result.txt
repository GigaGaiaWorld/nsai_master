Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly handle the case when both unselected doors are empty (no prize), ensuring one is opened randomly. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "C5B4A895","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(S),\n    member(A,[1,2,3]),\n    member(B,[1,2,3]),\n    A < B,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ select_door(B)."}
```

This solution:
1. Randomly selects between two empty doors (A and B) when both are available
2. Ensures A < B to avoid duplicate cases
3. Checks that neither door has the prize
4. Verifies neither door is the selected door
5. Maintains the 0.5 probability for each choice when both doors are empty
