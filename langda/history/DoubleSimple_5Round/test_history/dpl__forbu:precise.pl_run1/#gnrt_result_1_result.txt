Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly implement the bubblesort algorithm with recursive calls. The current code is incomplete and needs to properly handle the recursive sorting step.

```problog
{"HASH": "2971FD2F","Code": "bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :- bubble(L,L2,X), bubblesort(L2,[X|L3],Sorted)."}
```

This completes the bubblesort predicate by:
1. First calling bubble/3 to get the current maximum element X and remaining list L2
2. Then recursively calling bubblesort on L2 while accumulating the sorted elements in [X|L3]
3. The base case (bubblesort([],L,L)) handles the termination when the list is empty

The rest of the code (hole/4, bubble/3, swap/3, forth_sort/2) remains correct and doesn't need regeneration.
