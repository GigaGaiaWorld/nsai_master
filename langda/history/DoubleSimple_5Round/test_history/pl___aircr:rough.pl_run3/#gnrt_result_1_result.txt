Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code snippet that calculates the attempted flap position based on previous position, actuator used, and wind effect. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A5C06F43","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),\n \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n use_actuator(Time,Actuator),\n actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),\n wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),\n Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect."}
```

This code:
1. Takes the previous flap position
2. Checks if goal hasn't been reached yet
3. Gets the actuator being used and its strength
4. Incorporates the wind effect
5. Calculates the new attempted position by adding actuator strength and wind effect to previous position

The regeneration addresses the requirement to calculate the current position based on previous position, actuator used, and wind effect while ensuring we only move when the goal hasn't been reached yet.
