Based on the requirements, I need to complete the `multi_addition` predicate in the <langda> block that will parse two lists of images into numbers and add them together. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Code": "multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,Xnum), number(Y,Ynum), Z is Xnum + Ynum."}
```

This completes the `multi_addition` predicate by:
1. First converting both image lists X and Y to their numeric representations (Xnum and Ynum) using the existing `number` predicate
2. Then calculating Z as the sum of these two numbers
3. The predicate will work with the example query `multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)` to produce Z = 79 + 312 = 391
