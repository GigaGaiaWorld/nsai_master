System: You are a coding assistant.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: EA5E8D55 </HASH>
<Requirements>With the counter CNT decreasing to 0, each step:  If the CNTth coin coin(CNT) turns up heads, the success count SC increases by 1;  Otherwise, it remains unchanged;  Finally, all steps are accumulated to S. </Requirements></Langda>
.
total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).

</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
