Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to regenerate the `prove(expand(A,B))` clause to properly use the defined expand/2 rules. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "22D05CCC","Code": "prove(expand(A,B)) :- expand(A,B)."}
```

This implementation:
1. Directly calls the expand/2 predicate which will use the user-defined expansion rules
2. Matches the requirement to "use defined expand/2 rules below to expand A into B"
3. Provides the proper interface between the meta-interpreter and the expansion rules

The original code was incomplete (cut off mid-implementation), while this version properly connects the meta-interpreter's expand proof goal with the actual expansion rules defined in the program.
