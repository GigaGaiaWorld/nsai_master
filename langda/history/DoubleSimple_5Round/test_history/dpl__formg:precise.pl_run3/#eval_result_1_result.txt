{"HASH": "MAIN_CODE","ErrorSummary": "Parser error due to malformed code structure (likely from empty Langda blocks)","SuggestedFix": "1. Remove empty Langda blocks or fill them with proper implementations. 2. Ensure proper predicate formatting (the merge_sort/2 predicate was split incorrectly). The complete correct implementation should be: merge_sort(List, Sorted) :- length(List, Len), Len > 1, split_list(List, Left, Right), merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft), merge_sort(Right, SortedRight), merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).","Dependencies": ["95E704F2", "26E82D5D"],"NeedRegenerate": true}
