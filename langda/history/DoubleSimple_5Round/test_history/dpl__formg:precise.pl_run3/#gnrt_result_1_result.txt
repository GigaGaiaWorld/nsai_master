Based on the requirements in the <langda> blocks, I'll regenerate the code sections while maintaining the overall structure. Here are the completed code snippets:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2","Code": "merge_sort(List, Sorted) :- length(List, Len), Len > 1, split_list(List, Left, Right), merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft), merge_sort(Right, SortedRight), merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Code": "merge_sort(List, Sorted) :- length(List, Len), Len > 1, split_list(List, Left, Right), merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft), merge_sort(Right, SortedRight), merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)."}
```

Note that both code snippets actually contain the same complete implementation since the requirements for both blocks are essentially describing different aspects of the same recursive merge sort process. The complete implementation includes:
1. Length check and base cases (handled by the first two rules)
2. Splitting the list
3. Recursive sorting of both halves
4. Merging the sorted halves

The original code already had most of these components, but I've consolidated them into a single recursive rule that satisfies both sets of requirements.
