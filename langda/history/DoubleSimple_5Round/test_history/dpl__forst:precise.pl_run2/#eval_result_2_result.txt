{"HASH": "6931D64E", "ErrorSummary": "Incomplete stack_op(sort) predicate definition and syntax error in the code block", "SuggestedFix": "1. Complete the stack_op(sort) predicate by adding the missing body after the :- operator. 2. Ensure proper syntax by closing all predicates with a period. The sort3 predicates are correctly defined but need to be properly integrated into the stack_op(sort) predicate.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
