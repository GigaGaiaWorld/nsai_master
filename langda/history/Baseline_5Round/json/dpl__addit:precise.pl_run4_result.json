  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image references into a multi-digit number, and then performs addition. This is a valid extension of the original concept, which only handled single-digit additions. The code is consistent with the original in terms of using the 'digit' facts and performing arithmetic operations. The generated code correctly implements the new multi-digit addition feature, as evidenced by the correct result (79 + 312 = 391)."
