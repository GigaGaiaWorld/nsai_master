  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same functionality for merge sort, including the base cases, recursive splitting, and merging of sorted lists. The only difference is the renaming of 'split_list' to 'split', which does not affect the logic or outcome. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the correct sorted list."
