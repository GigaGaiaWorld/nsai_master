  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same functionality for merge sort, including the base cases, recursive splitting, and merging of lists. The only difference is the renaming of 'split_list' to 'split', which does not affect the logic or outcome. The generated code produces the same sorted list as the original when queried with the same input."
