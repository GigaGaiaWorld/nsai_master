  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code, with only a minor syntactic change in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate where 'goal(Old)' was replaced with 'goal_reached(Prev)'. This change does not affect the logic or the results, as both conditions check whether the goal has been reached. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their consistency."
