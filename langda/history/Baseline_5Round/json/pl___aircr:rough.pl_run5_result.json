  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main changes in the generated code are in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where variable names have been updated for clarity (e.g., 'Old' to 'PrevPos', 'GP' to 'Target', 'A' to 'Actuator', etc.), but the underlying logic remains the same. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the changes did not affect the program's behavior."
