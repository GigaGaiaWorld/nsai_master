  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog, with the same base and recursive cases. The generated code uses slightly different predicate names (insert instead of insert_element) but maintains the same behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the correct sorted list [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] for the input [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]."
