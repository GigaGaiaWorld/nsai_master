  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. However, there is a minor issue in the `compute_score` predicate for the 'draw' case. The original code correctly updates the score by keeping it the same (S is S1), while the generated code mistakenly omits this update (just computes S1 without assigning it to S). Despite this, the running results are consistent because the specific query provided doesn't trigger this case in a way that would affect the final outcome."
