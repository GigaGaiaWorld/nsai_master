  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the original carrying/2 predicate by removing the position checks, which alters the logic. The robot movement logic is slightly restructured but remains functionally similar. The main issue is in the carrying/2 predicate where the generated version lacks the position checks (at/3 predicates), leading to different probabilities in the results. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results due to this logical change."
