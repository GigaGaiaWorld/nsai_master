  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, the order of digits in the sumdigit predicates is incorrect compared to the original code, which affects the logic of the column addition. Specifically, the generated code swaps the positions of A and B in the tens place addition and misplaces D and B in the units place addition. Additionally, the generated code does not enforce the constraint that the hundreds place addition should produce no carry, unlike the original code. These logical errors result in no valid solutions being found, as evidenced by the run result."
