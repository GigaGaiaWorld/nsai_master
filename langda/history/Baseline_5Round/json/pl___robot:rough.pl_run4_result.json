  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the original carrying predicate by removing the position checks, which alters the logic. The robot movement logic is slightly restructured but remains functionally similar. The main issue is in the carrying predicate, where the generated version lacks the position verification present in the original, leading to different probabilities in the results. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results due to this logical change."
