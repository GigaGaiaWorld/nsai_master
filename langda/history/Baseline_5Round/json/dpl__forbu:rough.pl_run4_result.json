  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm similar to the original code but uses a different approach with conditional statements (->/2) which are not supported in standard Prolog or Problog. This causes an error during execution. The original code uses a helper predicate 'hole' and 'swap' to manage element swapping, while the generated code tries to handle swapping directly within the 'bubble' predicate using conditionals. The generated code is not valid due to the unsupported syntax and fails to run, whereas the original code executes correctly and produces the expected sorted list."
