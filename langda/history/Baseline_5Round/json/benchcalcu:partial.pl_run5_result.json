  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. Both codes solve the cryptoaddition problem AB + BCD = CDE with the same constraints and logic. However, the generated code has redundant digit(B) checks since B is already constrained by leftdigit(B). The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same set of solutions with the same probabilities."
