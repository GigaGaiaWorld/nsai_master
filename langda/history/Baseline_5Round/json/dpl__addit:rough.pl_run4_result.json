  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle lists of images representing multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The code is logically correct and produces the expected result (79 + 312 = 391). It maintains consistency with the original code's approach while adding new capabilities."
