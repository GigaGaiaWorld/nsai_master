  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes aim to solve the cryptoaddition problem AB + BCD = CDE with the same constraints. The generated code correctly maintains the digit definitions, leftdigit constraints, and all_different checks. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the generated code where 'digit(B)' is redundantly called after 'leftdigit(B)', which is unnecessary but doesn't affect functionality. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code produces the same solutions as the original."
