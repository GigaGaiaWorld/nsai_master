  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm but contains syntax errors and logical issues. The main problem is the use of '->/2' which is not correctly implemented, leading to a runtime error. The original code successfully sorts the list using a different approach with hole/4 and swap/3 predicates. The generated code's structure differs significantly from the original, and it fails to execute due to the mentioned error."
