  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. However, there is a significant difference in the implementation of 'implies/2'. The original code succeeds if either the antecedent is unprovable or the consequent is provable, while the generated code requires both the antecedent and consequent to be provable. This makes the generated version stricter than the original. Despite this difference, the running results are consistent for the given queries, as they happen to satisfy both implementations."
