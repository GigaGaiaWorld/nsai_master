  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code, with only minor syntactic differences that do not affect the logic or functionality. The key changes include adding 'Time > 0' to the overrun_exception rule and reordering the conditions in the goal_reached rule. These changes do not alter the program's behavior, as evidenced by the identical run results. Both codes produce the same probabilities for goal_reached and overrun_exception at each time step, confirming their functional equivalence."
