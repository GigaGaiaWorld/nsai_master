  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the original conditions for carrying the key by removing the position checks, which alters the logic. The goto action timing is also changed (s(s(0)) instead of s(0)), affecting the robot's movement sequence. These changes lead to different probabilities in the results, particularly for carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) and the key's location probabilities. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results with the original due to logical modifications."
