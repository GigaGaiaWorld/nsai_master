  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm in Prolog. The main difference lies in the definition of the 'swap' predicate. The original code uses negation ('\\+') to define the swap condition, while the generated code explicitly defines the conditions for 'swap' and 'no_swap' using '>' and '=<'. Despite this syntactic difference, the logic remains the same, and both codes produce identical sorting results."
