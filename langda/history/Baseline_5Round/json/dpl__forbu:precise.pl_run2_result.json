  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm in Prolog. The main difference lies in the definition of the 'swap' predicate. The original code uses negation as failure (\\+) to define the swap condition, while the generated code explicitly defines the conditions for swap and no_swap using '>' and '=<'. Despite this difference, the logic remains equivalent, and both produce the same sorted output for the given input."
