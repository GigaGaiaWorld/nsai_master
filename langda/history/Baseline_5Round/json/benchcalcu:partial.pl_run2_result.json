  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes implement the same cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with identical constraints and digit addition rules. The generated code maintains the same structure for digit definitions, leftdigit checks, sumdigit calculations, and all_different constraints. The only minor differences are in formatting and variable naming (Carry1 vs C1, Carry2 vs C2), which do not affect the logic. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same set of valid solutions with the same probabilities."
