  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. Both codes define the same basic rules for rock-paper-scissors and implement the same game result calculation and score computation. However, the generated code uses a different syntax for the conditional statement in the 'determine_winner' predicate, which leads to a runtime error. The original code uses semicolons to separate conditions, while the generated code uses the '->' operator, which is not correctly interpreted by Problog, resulting in an 'UnknownClause' error."
