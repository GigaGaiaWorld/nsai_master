  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the parsing logic by directly evaluating binary operations in a left-associative manner, which differs from the original code's approach of handling operator precedence and unary negation. This leads to different results for the same input. The original code correctly evaluates the expression as -10.333, while the generated code incorrectly evaluates it as 11.666 due to not properly handling operator precedence and negation."
