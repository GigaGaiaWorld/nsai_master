  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. Both codes define the same set of digit facts and an addition predicate that sums the values associated with two images. The only difference is the use of different variable names (A and B instead of X2 and Y2) in the addition predicate, which does not affect the functionality or the result. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same output for the query addition(img_5,img_6,Z)."
