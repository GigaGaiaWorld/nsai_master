  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the parsing logic by directly evaluating binary operations in a left-associative manner, which differs from the original code's approach of handling operator precedence and unary negation. This leads to incorrect results for expressions requiring proper precedence handling, such as the given query. The original code correctly evaluates the expression to -10.333, while the generated code yields 11.667 due to incorrect precedence handling."
