  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot). However, it introduces a new 'sort' operation and includes an implementation of 'insertion_sort', which was not present in the original code. The generated code fails to run due to an error related to 'append/3', indicating a missing or incorrect implementation of the 'append' predicate. This error prevents the code from executing successfully."
