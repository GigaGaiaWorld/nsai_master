  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause, which causes an error during execution. Specifically, the line 'coin(C)' in the generated code is problematic because 'C' is not instantiated, leading to a non-ground probabilistic clause error. This differs from the original code, where 'coin(CNT)' is properly instantiated. The original code runs successfully and produces the expected probabilistic results, while the generated code fails to execute due to this error."
