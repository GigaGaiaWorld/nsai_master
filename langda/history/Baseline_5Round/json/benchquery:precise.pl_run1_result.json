  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It introduces a new constraint `C1 @< C2` to ensure unique pairs by alphabetical order, which is a reasonable improvement. The logic for comparing population densities (`20*D1 < 21*D2` and `20*D2 < 21*D1`) is equivalent to the original but more symmetrically expressed. The running results are consistent with the original, except for the order of countries in the pair `[china, 244, france, 246]`, which is reversed due to the `C1 @< C2` constraint. This does not affect the correctness of the result."
