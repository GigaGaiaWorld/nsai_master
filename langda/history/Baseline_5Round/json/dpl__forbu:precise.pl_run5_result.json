  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm, and they produce the same sorted output for the given input list. The only difference lies in the definition of the 'swap' predicate. The original code uses negation ('\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)') to determine a swap, while the generated code explicitly defines the conditions for 'swap' and 'no_swap' using 'X > Y' and 'X =< Y' respectively. This change does not affect the overall behavior of the program."
