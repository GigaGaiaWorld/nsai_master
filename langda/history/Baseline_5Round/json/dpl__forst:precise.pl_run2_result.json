  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It successfully implements all stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The sorting logic has been simplified by using `sort3` predicate which correctly sorts the top three elements of the stack. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming the consistency."
