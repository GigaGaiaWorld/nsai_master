  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct but differs from the original in two key aspects. First, the density calculation in the original uses integer division (//) while the generated code uses floating-point division (/). Second, the original code checks for density ratios (20*D1 < 21*D2) while the generated code checks for absolute differences within 5%. The results are similar but not identical due to these differences. The generated code is valid and meets requirements, but the results are not fully consistent with the original."
