  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. However, there is a significant difference in the implementation of the 'implies/2' predicate. The original code succeeds if the antecedent is unprovable or the consequent is provable, while the generated code requires both the antecedent and consequent to be provable. This change alters the logical meaning of 'implies'. Despite this difference, the running results are consistent for the given queries because the specific test cases happen to satisfy both implementations."
