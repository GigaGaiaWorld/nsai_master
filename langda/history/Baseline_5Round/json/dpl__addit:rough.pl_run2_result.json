  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to convert lists of digit images into numerical values and a 'multi_addition' predicate to perform addition on these numbers. The code is logically correct and meets the requirements, as demonstrated by the correct result of adding 79 and 312 to get 391. The generated code is consistent with the original in terms of using digit/2 facts but expands the capability to handle multi-digit numbers."
