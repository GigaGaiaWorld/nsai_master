  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the parsing logic by breaking down expressions into binary operations. However, it fails to handle the original complex expression correctly, leading to a runtime error. The error occurs because the 'almost_equal' predicate is called with non-ground arguments, which violates its expected usage. The original code successfully processes the expression by recursively evaluating sub-expressions, while the generated code lacks this capability."
