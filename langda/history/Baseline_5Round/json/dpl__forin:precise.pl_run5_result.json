  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog, and the variable names in the generated code (SortedT) are slightly different but functionally equivalent to the original (TSorted). The logic and structure of both codes are identical, and they produce the same sorted output for the given input list."
