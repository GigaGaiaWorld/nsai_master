  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image references into a multi-digit number and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these numbers. The code is correct and meets the requirements, as demonstrated by the accurate result of adding 79 and 312 to get 391. The generated code is consistent with the original in terms of logic but handles more complex cases."
