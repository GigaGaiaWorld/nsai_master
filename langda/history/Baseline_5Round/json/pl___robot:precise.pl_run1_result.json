  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The predicates and probabilistic rules are accurately replicated, and the structure remains unchanged. The generated code includes comments for better readability, which is an improvement over the original. Both codes produce identical results when executed, confirming their equivalence in behavior."
