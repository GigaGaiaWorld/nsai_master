The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but contains syntax errors, particularly in the use of 'findall' and probabilistic choices within the same clause. This makes the code invalid and unexecutable. The original code correctly implements the problem with proper probabilistic rules and conditions for opening doors, resulting in the expected probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors. The generated code fails to meet these requirements due to its incorrect syntax and structure.
