problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5. 

***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause, which causes an error during execution. The original code correctly uses a ground probabilistic clause with `coin(C)` and handles the counting logic properly. The generated code attempts to use a variable `C` in a probabilistic context without proper grounding, leading to the error. Additionally, the counting logic in the generated code is flawed as it doesn't properly accumulate the count of successful coin flips.
