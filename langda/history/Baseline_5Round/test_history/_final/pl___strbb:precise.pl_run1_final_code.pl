The generated code modifies the 'bb' predicate by replacing 'II is I+1, pick(II,b)' with 'pick(I+1, b)'. This change is syntactically correct but alters the logic, leading to a different probability calculation. The original code ensures that two consecutive positions are picked as 'b', while the generated code may not maintain this exact sequence due to the direct use of 'I+1' in the pick statement. This explains the discrepancy in the run results (0.3750 vs 0.6484).
