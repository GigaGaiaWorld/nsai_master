The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm in Prolog, including base cases for empty and single-element lists, splitting the list into halves, recursively sorting each half, and merging the sorted halves. The only difference is the renaming of 'split_list' to 'split' in the generated code, which does not affect the functionality. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the correct sorted list.
