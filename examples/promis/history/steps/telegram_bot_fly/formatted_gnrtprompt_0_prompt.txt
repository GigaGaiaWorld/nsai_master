System: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. You could use the available tools to complete the task.
Human: Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 9EC55593 </HASH>
<Requirements>According to the user: my drone is at (200,200) it will come back to me, 
please extract the points and form as: fly([]).
store all the points inside the list, for example [(0,0),(50,50),(50,100)]  </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(fly(X)).

</Code>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here
```
</Final_Answer>


AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 9EC55593 </HASH>
<Requirements>According to the user: my drone is at (200,200) it will come back to me, 
please extract the points and form as: fly([]).
store all the points inside the list, for example [(0,0),(50,50),(50,100)]  </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(fly(X)).

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

% Define the points the drone will fly through
fly([(200,200), (150,150), (100,100), (50,50), (0,0)]).

% Query to retrieve the flight path
query(fly(X)).

<generated_code>
<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
