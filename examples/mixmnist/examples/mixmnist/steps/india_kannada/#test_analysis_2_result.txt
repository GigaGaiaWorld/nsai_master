# Code Analysis Report: ProbLog Digit Recognition and Anomaly Detection

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program designed to:
1. Recognize digits from different languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) using neural networks
2. Convert digit sequences to numerical values
3. Detect anomalies when the sum of two numbers exceeds 120

The system combines DeepProbLog capabilities (neural network integration) with probabilistic logic programming for digit recognition and anomaly detection.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show four test cases with the following outcomes:

```
anomaly_detection([img_1, img_9],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000
anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1],[img_1, img_5],1) = 0.0000
anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000
anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5],[img_5, img_9],1) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly identify that only the case with digits [9,5] and [5,9] (summing to 95 + 59 = 154) triggers the anomaly detection (result=1), while the other cases with sums ≤120 return 0.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The system correctly:
1. Uses the appropriate language-specific digit recognizer (Kannada, based on user location)
2. Converts digit sequences to numbers
3. Applies the anomaly detection threshold (sum > 120)

The predicates are properly defined:
- `number/3` (recursive number conversion)
- `number/2` (wrapper)
- `anomaly_detection/3` (threshold check)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The recursive `number/3` predicate correctly accumulates the total value
- Base case `number([],Result,Result)` ensures termination
- Anomaly detection properly checks the sum threshold

**Probabilistic Aspects:**
- Neural network predicates (`nn/4`) correctly define digit recognition
- Probability computations follow P(¬A)=1−P(A) principle
- DeepProbLog integration is correct (neural network outputs feed into logical reasoning)

**Location-Based Adaptation:**
- Based on coordinates (12.2958° N, 76.6394° E), the system correctly identified India/Karnataka and selected `kannada_digit/2` for digit recognition

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning: ✔ (correct number conversion and threshold check)
2. Probabilistic reasoning: ✔ (proper handling of neural network uncertainties)
3. Neural network integration: ✔ (correct DeepProbLog usage with `nn/4` predicates)

**Edge Cases Considered:**
- Empty lists would return 0 (handled by base case)
- Single-digit inputs work correctly
- Deep recursion could be problematic for very long sequences (not tested)

**DeepProbLog Usage:**
- Neural networks are properly integrated for digit recognition
- Four language-specific networks are defined
- Network outputs are correctly used in the probabilistic reasoning

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Consider adding tests for edge cases (empty lists, very long sequences) |
| 2 | None | None | Could add validation for input image format |
| 3 | None | None | Might consider adding more language support |

The system performs as designed, correctly identifying anomalies when digit sums exceed the threshold while properly integrating neural network recognition with probabilistic logic programming.
