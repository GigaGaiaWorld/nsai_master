# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection System

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed for multi-language digit recognition and anomaly detection. The system uses neural networks to classify digits from different languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) and implements logic to detect anomalous sums of converted numbers.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 test cases with the following outcomes:
```
anomaly_detection([img_1, img_9],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000
anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1],[img_1, img_5],1) = 0.0000
anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000
anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5],[img_5, img_9],1) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly show:
1. Cases where sum ≤ 120 return 0 (non-anomalous)
2. The case where sum > 120 (95+59=154) correctly returns 1 (anomalous)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The following components work correctly:
- Language-specific digit recognition (Telugu in this case)
- Number conversion from digit lists
- Anomaly detection threshold logic (sum > 120)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
- Logical correctness verified through proper recursive termination in `number/3`
- Digit conversion correctly accumulates values (units, tens place)
- Anomaly detection properly implements the sum threshold condition

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- Neural network outputs are properly integrated via `nn/4` predicates
- Probability computations follow standard rules (P(¬A)=1−P(A))
- The system correctly handles deterministic cases (0 or 1 outcomes)

**DeepProbLog Integration:**
- Neural network integration confirmed via `nn/4` declarations
- Proper fusion of neural outputs (digit classification) with logical rules
- All digit recognition predicates (arabic_digit, telugu_digit, etc.) are correctly defined

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- ✔ Classical reasoning (number conversion, threshold check)
- ✔ Probabilistic reasoning (neural network uncertainty handling)
- ✔ Neural network integration (multi-language digit classification)

**Edge Cases Considered:**
- Empty lists handled by `number([],Result,Result)`
- Proper list processing in recursive `number/3`
- Threshold comparison handles all integer ranges

**Potential Improvements:**
- Add input validation for non-list inputs
- Consider adding probabilistic thresholds
- Include more language-specific test cases
