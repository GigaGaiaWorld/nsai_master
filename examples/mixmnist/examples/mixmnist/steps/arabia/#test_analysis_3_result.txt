# Code Evaluation Report: Anomaly Detection in Multi-Language Digit Recognition

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed for multi-language digit recognition and anomaly detection. The system uses neural networks to recognize digits from different languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) and implements anomaly detection logic based on geographic coordinates. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and analyze its compliance with probabilistic logic principles.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show three test cases:
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1],[img_1, img_5],1) = 1.0000` ✅
2. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000` ✅
3. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5],[img_5, img_9],1) = 0.0000` ✅

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The anomaly detection correctly identifies cases where the first number is ≥60 and the second is ≤20, returning 1 (anomaly) in such cases and 0 otherwise.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The anomaly detection rules:
```prolog
anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, 1) :- 
    number(Digit1, Temp), 
    number(Digit2, Flow), 
    Temp >= 60, 
    Flow =< 20.
anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, 0) :- 
    \+ anomaly_detection(Digit1, Digit2, 1).
```
correctly implement the specified logic.

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
- The recursive `number/3` predicate correctly converts digit lists to numbers with proper termination (`number([],Result,Result)`).
- The anomaly detection uses classical negation (`\+`) appropriately.

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- The neural network definitions (`nn/4`) correctly declare probabilistic digit recognition.
- The program follows probabilistic rules: `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` is respected in the second anomaly detection rule.
- The test results show the expected 1.0 and 0.0 probabilities for deterministic cases.

**DeepProbLog Integration:**
- Neural networks are declared but not actively used in the test cases (only image placeholders like `img_9` appear).
- **Finding:** DeepProbLog feature declared but not fully utilized in testing.

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for number conversion and anomaly detection
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correct handling of probabilities and negation
- Neural network integration: Declared but not demonstrated in test cases

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
1. Non-list input to `number/2` would fail (no handling)
2. Empty lists would return 0 (via `number([],0,0)`)
3. Deep recursion could occur with long digit lists (no protection)
4. Undefined digit images would cause failures (no default handling)

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | DeepProbLog not fully tested | Limited validation of NN integration | Add test cases with actual NN queries |
| 2 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking predicates |
| 3 | Geographic logic not implemented | Country-specific rules not activated | Implement coordinate-based language selection |

**Word Count:** 498 words

The implementation correctly handles the demonstrated test cases but would benefit from expanded testing of neural network integration and additional input validation. The geographic-based anomaly detection logic described in the requirements is declared but not implemented in the visible code section.
