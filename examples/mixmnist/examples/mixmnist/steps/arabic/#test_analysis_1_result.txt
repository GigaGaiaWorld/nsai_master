# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection System

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed for anomaly detection in digit sequences using language-specific neural networks. The system converts digit images to numbers and applies business logic to detect anomalies based on temperature and flow thresholds.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 queries with their probability outcomes:
1. `anomaly_detection([img_1, img_9],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000` ✅
2. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1],[img_1, img_5],1) = 1.0000` ✅  
3. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000` ✅
4. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5],[img_5, img_9],1) = 1.0000` ✅

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results correctly reflect the expected behavior where anomalies are detected when either:
- Temperature ≥ 60 (converted from digits [9,1] = 91)
- Flow ≤ 20 (converted from digits [1,5] = 15)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The system correctly:
1. Converts digit sequences to numbers using the appropriate language-specific predicate (Arabic in this case)
2. Applies the anomaly detection logic consistently
3. Handles both positive and negative cases

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The recursive `number/3` predicate correctly accumulates digits into a number
   - The anomaly conditions (`Temp ≥ 60` or `Flow ≤ 20`) are properly implemented
   - The negation in the 0-case rule correctly complements the 1-case rule

2. **Probabilistic Compliance**:
   - The neural network outputs (`arabic_digit/2`) properly integrate with the deterministic logic
   - The system follows `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` through the explicit negation in the 0-case rule

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - Neural network declarations (`nn/4`) are correctly defined for multiple languages
   - The system uses Arabic digit recognition (based on user location) through proper predicate selection
   - **DeepProbLog feature used**: Neural network outputs are correctly fused with logical reasoning

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met**:
- ✔ Classical reasoning: Correct number conversion and threshold logic
- ✔ Probabilistic reasoning: Proper handling of neural network uncertainties
- ✔ Neural integration: Language-specific digit recognition

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. Empty digit lists would fail in number conversion (no base case for `number/2`)
2. Non-image inputs would cause neural network failures
3. Deep recursion could impact performance with long digit sequences

**Suggestions**:
1. Add input validation for empty lists
2. Include type checking for image inputs
3. Consider tail recursion optimization

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No empty list handling | Runtime failure | Add base case for empty list |
| 2 | No input type checking | Potential NN errors | Add type validation |
| 3 | Potential stack overflow | Performance issue | Implement tail recursion |

The system demonstrates correct implementation of its core functionality with appropriate neural network integration. Minor improvements in input validation and performance optimization would enhance robustness.
