# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Anomaly Detection System

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed for multi-language digit recognition and anomaly detection. The system uses neural networks to classify digits from different languages (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu) and implements logic to detect anomalous sums of converted numbers.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
1. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_1],[img_1, img_5],1) = 0.0000` ✅
2. `anomaly_detection([img_5, img_1],[img_5, img_1],1) = 0.0000` ✅
3. `anomaly_detection([img_9, img_5],[img_5, img_9],1) = 1.0000` ✅

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The system correctly identifies when the sum of two converted numbers exceeds 120 (the threshold for anomaly detection).

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The system correctly:
- Converts digit sequences to numbers using the appropriate language-specific predicates
- Calculates the sum of converted numbers
- Flags anomalies when sums exceed 120

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The recursive `number/3` predicate correctly converts digit lists to numbers
   - Base case (`number([],Result,Result)`) ensures termination
   - Anomaly detection threshold (120) is properly implemented

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - Neural network outputs are properly integrated via `nn/4` predicates
   - The system follows probabilistic rules (P(¬A)=1−P(A)) in the anomaly detection negation

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - Neural networks are correctly defined for each language (Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu)
   - The system properly fuses neural network outputs with logical reasoning

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Classical reasoning: Correct number conversion and anomaly detection
- ✅ Probabilistic reasoning: Proper handling of neural network uncertainties
- ✅ Neural network integration: Language-specific digit classification

**Edge Cases Considered**:
- Empty lists are handled by the base case in `number/3`
- The system assumes proper image inputs (undefined images would need handling)
- Deep recursion could be problematic for very long digit sequences

**Geographical Adaptation**:
The system successfully adapts to the user's location (16.5062° N, 80.6480° E is in India) by using Telugu digit recognition (`telugu_digit/2`) as the local language.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Consider adding input validation for images |
| 2 | None | None | Add handling for very long digit sequences |
| 3 | None | None | Consider making the anomaly threshold configurable |

**Word Count**: 423

The evaluation shows a robust implementation that meets all specified requirements with proper geographical adaptation and correct probabilistic reasoning. The test cases adequately verify the core functionality.
