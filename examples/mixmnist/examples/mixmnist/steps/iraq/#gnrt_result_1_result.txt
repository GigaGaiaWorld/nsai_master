Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> block in the origin_code.

The <Langda> block in origin_code was replaced with `arabic_digit(H,Nr)` in the generated_code, since the user's coordinates (33.3152° N, 44.3661° E) point to Iraq where Arabic is the official language.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "BD19A7AF","Code": "arabic_digit(H,Nr)"}
```
