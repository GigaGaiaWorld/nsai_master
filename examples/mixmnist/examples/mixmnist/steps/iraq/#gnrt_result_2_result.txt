Based on the given origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code.

The coordinates (33.3152° N, 44.3661° E) point to Baghdad, Iraq, where Arabic is the official language. Therefore, the generated code uses `arabic_digit(H,Nr)` as specified in the requirements.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```problog
{"HASH": "BD19A7AF","Code": "arabic_digit(H,Nr)"}
```
