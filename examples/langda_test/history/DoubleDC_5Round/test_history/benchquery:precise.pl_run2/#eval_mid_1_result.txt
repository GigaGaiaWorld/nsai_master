### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Density Query Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population densities. The code uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division and ensures logical correctness through constraints. The evaluation verifies the code's correctness, adherence to requirements, and robustness in edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate the following successful queries:
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected output, confirming the code's correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the constraints (`20 * D1 < 21 * D2`, etc.) ensure the desired approximation of population density equality.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to classical Prolog logic. The constraints avoid division and use integer arithmetic, ensuring termination and correctness.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features. It operates purely in a deterministic context.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as:
  - Countries with zero area (not present in the database).
  - Non-list inputs (not applicable here as the input format is fixed).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly queries and filters pairs of countries based on population density.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., no undefined `pop/2` or `area/2` facts).
  - Performance is not an issue due to the small dataset.
