{
  "HASH": "6931D64E",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core functionality. However, the `sort` operation lacks edge-case handling (empty stack, fewer than 3 elements) and could be inefficient for large stacks.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add guards to check stack length before sorting (e.g., `length(Stack, L), L >= 3`).\n2. Consider optimizing `sort` by limiting it to small stacks or using a more efficient sorting method.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
