### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, defining the rules of the game and calculating the winner based on a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs `paper`: `paper` beats `rock` (Player 2 wins).
    - `rock` vs `paper`: `paper` beats `rock` (Player 2 wins).
    - `rock` vs `scissor`: `rock` beats `scissor` (Player 1 wins).
  - The score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates and rules function as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are correctly defined, ensuring the game's win-lose relationships are accurately modeled.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly for empty lists and non-empty lists.
  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game's logic and computes the winner.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Non-list inputs or invalid moves would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game scenarios.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

#### **8. Code Blocks**
```prolog
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(paper, rock).
beats(scissor, paper).

% Calculate the result of the game
result(X, X, draw) :- move(X).
result(X, Y, win) :- beats(X, Y).
result(X, Y, lose) :- beats(Y, X).

% Recursive play and score computation
play([], [], []).
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
    result(P1, P2, R),
    play(P1T, P2T, Rs).

compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S).
```

#### **9. Conclusion**
The implementation is correct and meets the requirements for classical reasoning in ProbLog. No issues were found in the provided test case. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic rules or neural network integration for more advanced scenarios.
