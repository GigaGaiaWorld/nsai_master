<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of symbols (numbers and operators) and compute their results. The code includes predicates for detecting numbers and operators, parsing expressions, and ensuring numerical precision with `almost_equal/2`. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:  
  `query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).`
  
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  `CallModeError: Invalid argument types for call to '</2': arguments: (abs(X1-2*7.0), 0.0001), expected: (ground, ground) at 24:13.`

- **Failure**:  
  The error indicates that the `almost_equal/2` predicate was called with non-ground arguments, violating ProbLog's requirement for ground terms in arithmetic comparisons.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate**: `almost_equal/2`  
  - **Location**: Line 24, where `abs(X - Y) < 0.0001` is evaluated.  
  - **Issue**: The predicate assumes `Y` is ground, but during recursion, `Y` becomes a variable (`X1`), leading to the error.

- **Affected Rules**:  
  - All `parse/2` rules that rely on `almost_equal/2` for arithmetic comparisons.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `almost_equal/2` predicate is designed to handle both ground and non-ground cases, but the implementation fails to enforce groundness before arithmetic evaluation.  
  - **Classical Prolog**: The predicate should ensure `Y` is ground before performing arithmetic operations.  
  - **ProbLog**: The error arises because ProbLog enforces stricter mode requirements for arithmetic predicates.

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `parse/2` is structurally correct (terminates when the list is empty), but the arithmetic comparison issue prevents successful execution.

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The parsing logic is sound, but the arithmetic comparison fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or malformed expressions are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for very long expressions.  
  - The `almost_equal/2` predicate does not handle floating-point precision robustly.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `almost_equal/2` called with non-ground `Y` | Arithmetic comparison fails | Ensure `Y` is ground before evaluation or restructure the predicate. |
| 2   | No error handling for malformed inputs | Unpredictable behavior | Add input validation for lists and symbols. |
| 3   | No probabilistic reasoning | Limited to classical logic | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

### **Final Recommendations**
1. **Fix `almost_equal/2`**:  
   - Ensure `Y` is ground before arithmetic evaluation.  
   - Example:  
     ```prolog
     almost_equal(X, Y) :- ground(Y), abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
     almost_equal(X, Y) :- var(Y), Y is float(X).
     ```

2. **Add Input Validation**:  
   - Validate that input lists contain alternating numbers and operators.

3. **Extend for Probabilistic Use**:  
   - If probabilistic reasoning is required, add probabilistic facts or rules.

4. **Test Edge Cases**:  
   - Test with empty lists, non-numeric symbols, and deeply nested expressions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
