### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch or stay. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, verifying its correctness and adherence to probabilistic logic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic (as expected).  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The implementation correctly adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Random Door Opening:** When both unselected doors are empty, the host opens one randomly (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).  
2. **Deterministic Door Opening:** When one unselected door has no prize, the host opens it (`open_door(A)`).  
3. **Winning Conditions:**  
   - `win_keep` succeeds if the selected door has the prize.  
   - `win_switch` succeeds if the prize is behind the unselected, unopened door.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The rules for `open_door/1` and `win_keep/0`, `win_switch/0` are logically sound.  
  - Recursion in `member/2` terminates correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probabilities for `prize/1` and `open_door/1` comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met (e.g., `member/2`, deterministic rules).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (e.g., uniform distribution for `prize/1`).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** None detected.  
  - **Non-list Input:** Not tested, but `member/2` assumes list input.  
  - **Performance:** Recursion depth is minimal (no performance issues).
