### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, adherence to probabilistic rules, and edge-case handling. The code simulates the scenario where a player selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The player then decides whether to switch doors or stay with their initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts adhere to the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `open_door/1` predicate correctly implements the two clauses:  
  1. Randomly selects a door if two are available.  
  2. Opens the only available door if one is left.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is well-defined and terminates for finite lists.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly computed as `1/3` each.  
- Negation (`\+`) is used correctly, adhering to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic for door selection and prize distribution is sound.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and aligned with theory.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `select_door/1` is always called with a valid door).  
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate is robust but assumes list inputs.  
- **Performance:** Recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not a concern.

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's theoretical solution. No issues were found in classical or probabilistic reasoning. Edge cases are minimal and do not affect functionality.
