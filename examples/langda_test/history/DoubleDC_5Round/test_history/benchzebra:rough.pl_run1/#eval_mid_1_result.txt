### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle) in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Executed**: `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result**: 
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**: The output matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, confirming that all constraints are satisfied.
- **Conclusion**: **All tests passed (no failures)**. The code correctly deduces the arrangement of houses and their attributes.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. The code adheres to the puzzle's constraints and produces the correct output.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and terminate properly. Recursion is used safely with base cases.
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: All clues are encoded as constraints, and the solver correctly enforces them (e.g., `right_of(green, ivory)`).

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: No probabilistic facts are used in this implementation. The solution is deterministic (probability = 1.0000).
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used. **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code solves the puzzle using deterministic Prolog rules.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates**: All predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are defined.
- **Non-list Input**: The `houses/1` predicate ensures the input is a list of five houses.
- **Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is fixed (five houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and adheres to ProbLog's syntax. While the solution is purely deterministic, it effectively demonstrates classical logic programming. For future enhancements, consider:
- Adding probabilistic constraints (e.g., uncertain clues).
- Exploring DeepProbLog for hybrid reasoning tasks.
