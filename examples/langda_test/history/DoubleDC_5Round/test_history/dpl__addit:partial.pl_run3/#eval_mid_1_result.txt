### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of facts (`digit/2`) representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0 to 9). It also includes a rule (`addition/3`) to perform addition on the digits represented by two images. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The sum of the digits represented by `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6) is correctly computed as 11 with a probability of 1.0000.

- **Conclusion**:  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**. The code correctly implements the addition logic and adheres to the requirements.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  All predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the test results align with the expected outcomes. The `digit/2` facts and the `addition/3` rule are error-free.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `addition/3` rule is logically sound. It retrieves the digits associated with the input images (`digit(X,A)` and `digit(Y,B)`) and computes their sum (`Z is A + B`).  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  No recursion is used in the provided code, so termination is not a concern.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.7::digit(img_1,1)`). All facts are deterministic (probability 1.0000).  
- **Negations/Implications**:  
  Not applicable in this context, as the code does not involve probabilistic negations or implications.

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Neural Network Calls**:  
  The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/...`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
1. **Classical Reasoning**:  
   - Met. The `addition/3` rule correctly performs classical arithmetic addition.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
   - Not applicable. The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.  
3. **Neural Network Integration**:  
   - Not applicable. No DeepProbLog features are used.

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  No undefined predicates are present.  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  The code does not handle lists, so this is not a concern.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**:  
  Not applicable, as the code does not use recursion.  
- **Edge Cases for `addition/3`**:  
  The rule assumes valid `digit/2` facts for the input images. If an image is not defined (e.g., `img_10`), the query will fail silently. This could be addressed by adding validation.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No validation for undefined images in `addition/3` | Low | Add a check to ensure input images are defined. |
| 2      | No probabilistic facts or rules used | None | Consider extending the model for probabilistic scenarios if needed. |
| 3      | DeepProbLog features not utilized | None | Explore neural network integration for advanced use cases. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The provided ProbLog code is functionally correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. However, it lacks probabilistic and DeepProbLog features, which could be explored for more advanced applications. Edge cases like undefined inputs should be addressed for robustness.
