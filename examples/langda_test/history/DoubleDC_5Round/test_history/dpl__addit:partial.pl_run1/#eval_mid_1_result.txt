### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Addition Predicate

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Addition**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a simple digit addition system where images (`img_1` to `img_0`) correspond to digits (0–9). The predicate `addition(X, Y, Z)` computes the sum of the digits represented by `X` and `Y` and stores the result in `Z`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(addition(img_5, img_6, Z))`  
  - **Result**: `addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000`  
  - **Verification**: The result is correct (5 + 6 = 11).  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided code or test results.  
- **Expansion Predicates**: The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The `addition` predicate is logically correct. It retrieves the digits associated with `X` and `Y` and computes their sum using `Z is A + B`.  
  - No recursion is involved, so termination is guaranteed.  
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P::fact`). Thus, no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The code does not use neural network predicates (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/...`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The `addition` predicate performs deterministic arithmetic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code assumes all `digit/2` facts are defined. Undefined inputs (e.g., `digit(img_10, 10)`) would fail silently.  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled, but the current use case does not require it.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic facts/rules | Limited functionality | Consider adding probabilistic rules for uncertainty modeling. |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural network support | Use `nn/3` for image-based digit recognition if needed. |
| 3      | Undefined inputs not handled | Potential silent failures | Add validation for `digit/2` facts. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The code is functionally correct for classical reasoning but lacks probabilistic and neural network features. Edge cases should be addressed for robustness.
