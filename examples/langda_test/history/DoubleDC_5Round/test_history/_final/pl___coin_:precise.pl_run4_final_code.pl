***Report:***
Validity_form:True\Validity_result:False
The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of logic and results. While the generated code is syntactically correct and valid (Validity_form is true), it produces different results compared to the original code. The original code counts the number of successful coin flips out of 4 attempts, with each flip having a 0.8 probability of success. The generated code, however, seems to accumulate probabilities incorrectly, leading to inconsistent results (Validity_result is false). The main issue lies in the recursive logic of the generated code, which does not properly handle the counting of successful flips.
