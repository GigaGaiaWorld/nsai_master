### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing Predicates**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extending it with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Analyze test results and identify failures.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate the following outcomes for the queries:  

| Query | Expected Result | Actual Result |  
|-------|-----------------|---------------|  
| `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` | Success (1.0000) | Success (1.0000) |  
| `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` | Success (1.0000) | Failure (0.0000) |  
| `prove(expand(double(3),6))` | Success (1.0000) | Failure (0.0000) |  
| `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` | Success (1.0000) | Failure (0.0000) |  
| `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` | Success (1.0000) | Failure (0.0000) |  

**Failures:**  
- `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, and `extend/3` predicates failed to return the expected results.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
1. **Failed Query:** `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))`  
   - **Error Location:** Missing definition of `opposite/1`.  
   - **Expected:** A predicate to negate the input fact.  

2. **Failed Query:** `prove(expand(double(3),6))`  
   - **Error Location:** Incorrect implementation of `expand/2`.  
   - **Expected:** `expand(double(X), Y)` should unify `Y` with `X*2`.  

3. **Failed Query:** `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))`  
   - **Error Location:** Missing definition of `includes/2`.  
   - **Expected:** A predicate to check list membership.  

4. **Failed Query:** `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))`  
   - **Error Location:** Missing definition of `extend/3`.  
   - **Expected:** A predicate to prepend an element to a list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - Missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) caused failures.  
  - `expand/2` was defined but not correctly implemented for arithmetic operations.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - ProbLog requires explicit handling of probabilistic facts and rules.  
  - Negation (`opposite/1`) should comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) were used.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (missing predicates).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not fully evaluated due to missing predicates.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) lead to failures.  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion could cause runtime errors.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|---|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1 | Missing `opposite/1` | Query fails | Define `opposite(A) :- \+ A.` |  
| 2 | Incorrect `expand/2` | Query fails | Correct arithmetic unification: `expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.` |  
| 3 | Missing `includes/2` | Query fails | Define `includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).` |  
| 4 | Missing `extend/3` | Query fails | Define `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).` |

**Word Count:** 400  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The primary issues are missing or incorrect predicate definitions. Addressing these will resolve the test failures.
