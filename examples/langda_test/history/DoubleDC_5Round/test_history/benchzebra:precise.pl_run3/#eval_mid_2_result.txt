### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for the Zebra Puzzle: Error in `member/2` Predicate**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" by defining house arrangements and constraints. The goal is to deduce the correct arrangement of houses based on given rules. However, the code fails during execution due to an undefined `member/2` predicate. This report analyzes the failure, its root cause, and provides suggestions for resolution.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed**: `zebra(Houses)`.  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: The test fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)`.  
- **Error Location**: Line 4 of the code.  
- **Root Cause**:  
  - ProbLog does not include a built-in `member/2` predicate.  
  - The code assumes `member/2` is available, but it must be explicitly defined.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - In standard Prolog, `member/2` is a built-in predicate. However, ProbLog restricts the set of available predicates to maintain declarative semantics.  
  - The error occurs because the predicate is neither built-in nor user-defined.  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog requires all predicates to be explicitly defined or imported from supported libraries.  
  - The absence of `member/2` violates this requirement, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  

- **Solution**:  
  - Define `member/2` explicitly in the code:  
    ```prolog
    member(X, [X|_]).
    member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
    ```  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic for house arrangement is correct, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **DeepProbLog Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined predicates (`member/2`).  
  - Non-list inputs to `member/2` (handled by the explicit definition).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| #  | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1  | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Code fails to execute           | Define `member/2` explicitly.       |
| 2  | Assumption of built-in predicates | Misalignment with ProbLog specs | Verify predicate availability.      |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. **Define `member/2`**: Add the explicit definition to the code.  
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure the solution handles non-list inputs and recursive termination.  
3. **Documentation**: Clarify dependencies on user-defined predicates in the code comments.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.
