problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation with Non-Ground Probabilistic Clause Error**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing `CNT` independent coins and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`) to compute the total number of heads (`S`). The code includes a recursive predicate `coins_r/3` and a query `total(S)`. However, the test results indicate a `NonGroundProbabilisticClause` error, which violates ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic clauses must be ground (i.e., contain no uninstantiated variables).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(S)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to a non-ground probabilistic clause in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(S)`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate:** `coin(C)` in the recursive rule `coins_r/3`.  
  - **Line Interval:** The error originates from the probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).`, where `C` is not instantiated before being used in a probabilistic context.  
- **Impact:** The variable `C` in `coin(C)` remains unbound, violating ProbLog's grounding requirement for probabilistic facts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic in `coins_r/3` is sound for classical Prolog, but the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is non-ground.  
  - ProbLog requires all probabilistic facts to be ground (e.g., `coin(head) :- make_coin(head, 0.8).`).  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**  
  - The error occurs because `coin(C)` is not ground when evaluated, violating the rule that probabilistic facts must be deterministic (no unbound variables).  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the probabilistic fact is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground clause.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle cases where `CNT` is zero or negative (though the base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)` is defined).  
  - Performance for deep recursion (large `CNT`) is untested.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground probabilistic clause (`coin(C)`) | ProbLog rejects the code | Instantiate `C` (e.g., `coin(head)` and `coin(tail)`). |
| 2 | Undefined edge case for `CNT < 0` | Potential runtime error | Add a guard clause (`CNT >= 0`). |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**  
1. **Fix the Probabilistic Fact:**  
   Replace `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).` with ground facts like:  
   ```problog
   coin(head) :- make_coin(head, 0.8).
   coin(tail) :- make_coin(tail, 0.2).
   ```
2. **Validate Input:**  
   Add a check in `coins_r/3` to ensure `CNT` is non-negative.  
3. **Test Edge Cases:**  
   Verify the code for `CNT = 0` and large `CNT` values.

**Format:** Markdown with tables and code blocks.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
