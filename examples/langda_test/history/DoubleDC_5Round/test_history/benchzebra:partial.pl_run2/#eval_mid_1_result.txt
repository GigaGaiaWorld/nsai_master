### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle that requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on:  
- **Test Results Verification**: Ensuring all constraints are correctly enforced.  
- **Failure Localization**: Identifying any discrepancies between expected and actual results.  
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Checking logical correctness and probabilistic compliance.  
- **Overall Analysis**: Assessing functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test result for the query `zebra(Houses)` is:  
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The output satisfies all constraints specified in the puzzle.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules (e.g., `my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are correctly implemented and enforce the puzzle constraints.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog**:  
  - The recursive predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) terminate correctly and enforce spatial relationships.  
  - Logical correctness is verified by the output, which aligns with the puzzle's requirements.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `::`). It is purely deterministic.  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not relevant here.  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Houses` is a list of 5 houses. No handling for invalid inputs.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No issues were found.
