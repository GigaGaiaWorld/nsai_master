### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the game logic for rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of a round and calculating the overall score of a game. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game logic.
- Analyze the test results for accuracy.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided is:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Test Results:**
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],draw) = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player1) = 1.0000`

**Analysis:**
- The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0.
- **Conclusion:** The test results are incorrect. The query should return a single valid outcome with a probability of 1.0.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Root Cause:**
- The `determine_winner/3` predicate incorrectly allows multiple outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) to be true simultaneously. This is due to the disjunctive logic in the predicate:
  ```prolog
  ( S > 0, Winner = player1 ; S < 0, Winner = player2 ; S = 0, Winner = draw ).
  ```
  The disjunction (`;`) should be replaced with a deterministic choice (e.g., using `if-then-else` or a cut in classical Prolog, but ProbLog does not support cuts).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Context:**
- The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are logically correct and terminate properly.
- The issue lies in the non-deterministic handling of the `Winner` variable in `determine_winner/3`.

**ProbLog Context:**
- The probabilistic results violate the rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. The current implementation does not enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes.
- No probabilistic facts or neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used, so DeepProbLog features are not utilized.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The game logic is correct, but the outcome determination is flawed.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The results do not comply with probabilistic rules.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `determine_winner(rock, paper, W)`).
- Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Multiple outcomes with probability 1.0 | Incorrect results | Replace disjunction with deterministic logic |
| 2   | Probabilities sum to >1.0 | Violates ProbLog rules | Ensure mutual exclusivity of outcomes |
| 3   | Non-list inputs not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |
