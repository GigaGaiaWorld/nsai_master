### Explanation:
1. **Code Block 638F1761 (Robot Position Rules)**:
   - **Evaluation**: The predicates correctly model the robot's movement under three scenarios (successful goto, failed goto, no action). The logic aligns with the requirements, and the test results confirm correctness (e.g., `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9` matches the `0.9::goto_succeeds(T)` probability).
   - **Action**: No regeneration needed.

2. **Code Block BCB17653 (Key Position Rules)**:
   - **Evaluation**: The predicates accurately describe the key's position when carried by the robot or stationary. The test results (`at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`) reflect the combined probabilities of the robot's movement and key retention.
   - **Action**: No regeneration needed.

Both modules are logically and probabilistically sound, with no dependencies on other modules for fixes.
