### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Query for Population Density Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries and their population densities to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division, ensuring logical correctness and efficiency. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, analyzing test results, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and logical constraints.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate the following successful queries:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query logic correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities, as defined by the inequality `20 × D1 < 21 × D2`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the arithmetic constraints are satisfied for all tested cases.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Logical Correctness**  
- The `density/2` predicate calculates population density using integer division (`D is (P * 100) // A`), ensuring deterministic results.  
- The `query_pop/1` predicate enforces the inequality constraints (`20 × D1 < 21 × D2` and `20 × D2 < 21 × D1`) to approximate a 5% tolerance in density ratios.  

##### **Probabilistic Compliance**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs for `pop/2` and `area/2`. Missing data would lead to silent failures.  
- **Non-List Input:** The query format `[C1, D1, C2, D2]` is strictly enforced. Invalid formats would cause errors.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The query logic is sound and correctly identifies pairs of countries with similar densities.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases and Performance**  
- **Undefined Data:** The code does not handle missing population or area data.  
- **Performance:** The query is efficient due to the use of deterministic arithmetic and simple comparisons.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | No handling for missing data | Silent failures for undefined countries | Add validation for `pop/2` and `area/2` facts. |
| 2   | Non-list input not validated | Runtime errors | Enforce input format checks. |
