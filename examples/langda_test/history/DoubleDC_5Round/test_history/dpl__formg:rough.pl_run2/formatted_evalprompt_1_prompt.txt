</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`
- **Result**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The query successfully sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. The implementation adheres to the expected behavior for the given test case.
- **Expansion Predicates**: The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`), so no verification is required for them.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Context**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` are logically correct. The recursion terminates as the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are properly defined.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion depth is controlled by splitting the list into halves, ensuring termination.

##### **ProbLog Context**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or uncertainties are involved in this query.
- **DeepProbLog Features**: The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in Prolog.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this case, as the test result is deterministic.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.
- **Single-element List**: Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([X], [X])`.
- **Performance**: The algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), but deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Potential stack overflow | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The merge sort implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog semantics. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and could benefit from optimizations for large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. 

**Word Count**: 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
</Final_Answer>
