### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to ProbLog rules, and ensure it meets the specified functional requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog logic, probabilistic reasoning, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  `query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).`  
- **Result:**  
  `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` function as intended.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
1. `insertion_sort/2`: Recursively sorts the tail list and inserts the head element.  
2. `insert_element/3`: Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

**Expansion Predicates:**  
No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this code.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The code adheres to the insertion sort algorithm:  
  1. The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) handles empty lists.  
  2. The recursive case (`insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted)`) sorts the tail and inserts the head.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates when the input list is empty, ensuring no infinite loops.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements insertion sort.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may impact performance for very large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are called.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | May cause runtime errors       | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Performance issues for large N  | Consider iterative approaches.      |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The insertion sort implementation is correct for classical Prolog scenarios. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized. Enhancements could include input validation and performance optimizations for large datasets.
