### **Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog: Error Diagnosis and Recommendations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, diagnose errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
- **Result**:  
  ```  
  Error evaluating Problog model:  
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 3:15.  
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: The test failed due to an unsupported control construct (`->/2`) in ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `bubble/3`  
- **Error Location**: Line 3, Column 15  
- **Code Snippet**:  
  ```prolog
  (H1 =< H2 -> X1 = H1, X2 = H2 ; X1 = H2, X2 = H1)
  ```  
- **Issue**: ProbLog does not support the `->/2` (if-then) construct.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The logic of the `bubblesort/3` algorithm is correct in Prolog, but the `->/2` construct is not declarative and violates ProbLog's restrictions.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base case `bubble([X], [], X)`.  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog requires deterministic or probabilistic predicates. Control constructs like `->/2` are unsupported.  
  - **Workaround**: Replace `->/2` with a conjunction and disjunction:  
    ```prolog
    (H1 =< H2, X1 = H1, X2 = H2 ; H1 > H2, X1 = H2, X2 = H1)
    ```  

- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but syntactically invalid in ProbLog).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) will cause type errors.  
  - Deep recursion may lead to performance issues for large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported `->/2` construct | Code fails to execute | Replace with `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)` |
| 2 | No probabilistic features | Limited to classical sorting | Add probabilistic annotations if needed (e.g., `p::bubble/3`) |
| 3 | Non-list input handling | Runtime errors | Add input validation (e.g., `list(L) -> bubblesort(L, [], Sorted)`). |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**  
1. Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic.  
2. Add input validation for edge cases.  
3. Consider extending the algorithm with probabilistic features if needed.  

**Word Count**: 450

**Final Note**: The corrected code should adhere to ProbLog's syntax while preserving the original logic. Let me know if you'd like the revised implementation.
