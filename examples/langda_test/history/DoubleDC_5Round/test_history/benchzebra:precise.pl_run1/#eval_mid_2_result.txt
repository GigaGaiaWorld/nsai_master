### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on given constraints. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying failures, and analyzing root causes.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed**: `query(zebra(Houses))`  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
  problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
  ```  
- **Failure**: The predicate `member/2` is undefined in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)`  
- **Error Location**: Line 4, Column 1.  
- **Root Cause**:  
  - The `member/2` predicate is not natively supported in ProbLog unless explicitly imported or defined.  
  - The code attempts to use `member/2` without providing its definition or importing it from a library.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - In standard Prolog, `member/2` is a built-in predicate for list membership checks. However, ProbLog does not include this predicate by default.  
  - The error occurs because the code assumes `member/2` is available without defining it or importing the `lists` module.  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog supports a subset of Prolog's predicates, and `member/2` is not part of the default environment.  
  - The `lists` module in ProbLog provides `member/2`, but it must be explicitly imported.  

- **Suggested Fix**:  
  - Add the following line to import the `lists` module:  
    ```prolog
    :- use_module(library(lists)).
    ```  
  - Alternatively, define `member/2` manually:  
    ```prolog
    member(X, [X|_]).  
    member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
    ```  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The puzzle constraints are correctly encoded, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **DeepProbLog Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: The absence of `member/2` is a critical oversight.  
  - **Non-List Inputs**: The code assumes `Houses` is a list, but no checks are in place.  
  - **Recursive Performance**: The manually defined `my_member/2` is correct but unused.

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |  
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| 1   | Undefined `member/2` predicate  | Code fails to execute           | Import `lists` module or define `member/2` |  
| 2   | Assumes `Houses` is a list      | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation                       |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The primary issue is the missing `member/2` predicate. Once resolved, the code should execute correctly. No DeepProbLog features are used.
