### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query Tested:**  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```
**Verification:**  
- The result is correct. Player 2 wins because `paper` beats `rock` twice, and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a net score of `-1` (player2 wins).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The following predicates were verified:  
- `move/1`: Correctly defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
- `beats/2`: Correctly defines the win-lose relationships.  
- `result/3`: Correctly computes the outcome of a single round.  
- `play/3`: Recursively processes lists of moves and computes results.  
- `compute_score/2`: Correctly calculates the cumulative score.  
- `determine_winner/3`: Correctly determines the winner based on the score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly when the input lists are empty.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`).  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not utilized in this example.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes lists as input. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Undefined Moves:** If an undefined move (e.g., `spock`) is provided, the behavior is undefined.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion with large lists could impact performance, but this is unlikely in a game context.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | No probabilistic facts/rules | Limited to deterministic logic | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |
| 2   | No input validation | Undefined behavior for invalid moves | Add checks for valid moves. |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Consider adding neural predicates if required. |

**Word Count:** 450  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct for classical ProbLog but lacks probabilistic and neural features. Edge cases should be addressed for robustness.
