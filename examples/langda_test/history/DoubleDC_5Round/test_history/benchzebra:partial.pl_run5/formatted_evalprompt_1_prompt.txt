<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation against the provided test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test result provided is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**.
- The output matches the expected solution, satisfying all constraints:
  - The owner of the red house is English.
  - The Spanish person has a dog.
  - The green house owner drinks coffee.
  - The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
  - The middle house drinks milk.
  - The zebra is owned by the Japanese person.
  - Someone drinks water.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**.
- All predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are correctly defined and function as intended.
- The code adheres to ProbLog's supported constructs (conjunction, disjunction, negation-as-failure, etc.).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code correctly implements the puzzle constraints using recursive predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`).
- **Termination**: Recursive predicates terminate as they reduce the list size in each iteration.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::fact`). It is purely deterministic.
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable here.
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Houses` is a list of 5 houses. No handling for invalid inputs.
- **Deep Recursion**: Not an issue due to the fixed list size (5 houses).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code solves the puzzle deterministically.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not utilized.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases**: The code is robust for the given problem but lacks input validation.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The implementation is correct and meets the puzzle requirements. No improvements are needed for the given scope.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
