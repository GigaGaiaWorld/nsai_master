### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, edge cases, and potential failures.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passes with the correct output and a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `merge_sort/2` (lines 1–5)  
  - `split/3` (lines 7–9)  
  - `merge/3` (lines 11–16)  
- **Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Correctness**:  
  - The implementation adheres to the merge sort algorithm:  
    1. **Splitting**: The `split/3` predicate divides the list into two halves recursively.  
    2. **Merging**: The `merge/3` predicate combines sorted sublists while preserving order.  
  - **Termination**:  
    - Base cases (`[]`, `[X]`) ensure termination.  
    - Recursive calls reduce the problem size (`split` halves the list).  

- **ProbLog Compliance**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning violations exist.  
  - **DeepProbLog**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts lists.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: Undefined behavior (e.g., `merge_sort(123, X)`).  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists (e.g., 1M elements).  
  - **Empty List**: Handled correctly (`merge_sort([], [])`).

| No. | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                          |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input undefined | Runtime error        | Add input validation.               |
| 2   | Deep recursion risk      | Stack overflow       | Optimize tail recursion or use iteration. |
| 3   | No probabilistic features | Limited to classical | Extend with probabilistic examples. |
