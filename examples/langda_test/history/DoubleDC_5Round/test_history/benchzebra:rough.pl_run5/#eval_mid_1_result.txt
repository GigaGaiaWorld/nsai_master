### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  
- Analyze edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all constraints of the puzzle.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly checks adjacency.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly checks right adjacency.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The code adheres to the puzzle's constraints, ensuring no contradictions.  
  - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used (`::` operator not present).  
  - The solution is purely deterministic (classical Prolog).  
- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - Feature not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic elements).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not relevant here.  
  - **Non-list Input:** Not tested, but the code assumes list input.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for small lists (5 houses).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the puzzle's constraints. While the solution is purely classical, it demonstrates effective use of Prolog's declarative style. For future work, consider extending the puzzle with probabilistic elements (e.g., uncertain clues) to leverage ProbLog's full capabilities.
