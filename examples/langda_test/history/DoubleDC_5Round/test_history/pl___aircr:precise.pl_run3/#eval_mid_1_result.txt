#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog-Based Aircraft Flap Controller: Test Results and Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates flap adjustments under probabilistic actuator selection and wind interference. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 steps. This report evaluates the code's correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time due to wind interference and actuator variability.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented:  
- **`goal_reached/1`** and **`overrun_exception/1`** adhere to the requirements.  
- The probabilistic facts (`wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`) comply with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures no redundant calculations.  
- **Edge Cases:** The system handles illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception`) and avoids infinite recursion.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` sum to 1, adhering to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
- **Negation:** The use of `\+` for negation is correctly applied in `overrun_exception/1`.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** No neural network predicates (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Correctly handles flap positioning and goal checks.                         |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met      | Accurately models actuator selection and wind effects.                      |
| Neural Network Integration | N/A    | Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features).                                   |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** The system fails silently for undefined predicates (default ProbLog behavior).  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable (inputs are numeric).  
- **Deep Recursion:** Limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.
