### **Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Code in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition problem where the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` must hold, with each letter representing a unique digit (0-9) and the first digit of any multi-digit number being non-zero. The code uses deterministic Prolog rules and probabilistic reasoning (though no probabilistic facts are explicitly used). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results show the following queries and their return values (all with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic success):  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9])`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0])`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8])`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1])`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2])`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6])`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8])`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5])`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7])`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9])`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly enforces the constraints of the cryptoaddition problem, ensuring unique digits and non-zero leading digits.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- **Digit Constraints:** `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1` ensure valid digits and non-zero leading digits.  
- **Summation Logic:** `sumdigit/5` correctly handles carry-over and digit addition.  
- **Uniqueness Check:** `all_different/1` ensures all digits are unique.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The code adheres to classical Prolog logic, with no infinite recursion or unsupported constructs.  
  - The `sumdigit` predicate correctly models column-wise addition with carry-over.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - The code is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code solves the cryptoaddition problem deterministically.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (0-9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
  - **Performance:** The recursion in `all_different/1` is efficient for small lists (5 digits).
