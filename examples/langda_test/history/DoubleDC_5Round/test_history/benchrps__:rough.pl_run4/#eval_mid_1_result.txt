### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines the game rules, calculates the result of each round, and determines the winner based on a series of moves. The evaluation focuses on verifying the test results, identifying potential failures, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
  - The total score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The code correctly implements the game rules and computes the winner as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The predicates `move/1` and `beats/2` correctly define the game rules.
  - The `play_round/3` predicate accurately determines the outcome of each round (`win`, `lose`, or `draw`).
  - The recursive predicate `play/3` processes lists of moves and results without termination issues.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the cumulative score.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes results.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Invalid inputs (e.g., atoms not in `move/1`) would cause failures.
  - **Empty Lists:** The `play/3` predicate handles empty lists correctly.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game scenarios.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and robust for the given requirements. No failures were detected, and the code adheres to classical Prolog semantics. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation or extending the game to include probabilistic or DeepProbLog features.
