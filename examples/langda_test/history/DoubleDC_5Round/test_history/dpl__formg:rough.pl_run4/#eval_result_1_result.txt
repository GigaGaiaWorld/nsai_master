  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core merge sort logic. The implementation correctly handles sorting and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks probabilistic features and edge-case handling (e.g., non-list inputs, large lists).",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for list type (e.g., `merge_sort(List, _) :- is_list(List), !, ...`). 2. For DeepProbLog integration, extend with probabilistic rules (e.g., `0.5::merge_step(_, _)`). 3. Optimize recursion for large lists (e.g., iterative merge sort).",
