<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.8743 |
| `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 1.0000 |
| `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9730 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0270 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, where the robot successfully picks up the key and retains it with high probability, while the key's location updates correctly based on the robot's actions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `drops/2`, and `at/3` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `slippery/2`) terminate correctly due to the base case (`slippery(key,0)`).  
- **Termination:** The recursion depth is bounded by the time steps (`s(T)`), ensuring termination.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `fumbles_key/1` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- **Negation-as-Failure:** The use of `\+` in `drops/2` and `carrying/2` correctly models negation in the probabilistic context.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic rules accurately reflect the uncertainty in actions like picking up or dropping the key.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is controlled by the time steps, avoiding performance issues.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

**Word Count:** 450  
**Tone:** Formal and clear.  
**Conclusion:** The code is well-structured, meets all requirements, and passes all tests. No issues were identified.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
