  "HASH": "5E40E418",
  "ErrorSummary": "1. 'sort' fails for stacks with fewer than 3 elements. 2. Non-list inputs cause runtime errors. 3. 'insertion_sort' is inefficient for large stacks.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add a check for stack length in 'sort' (e.g., add a clause for stacks with fewer than 3 elements). 2. Validate input types in 'stack_op' (e.g., add type checks using 'is_list/1'). 3. Replace 'insertion_sort' with a more efficient algorithm like quicksort for large stacks.",
