<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the logic, test results, and adherence to functional requirements, including classical reasoning and probabilistic inference. The main predicate `determine_winner/3` calculates the winner based on two lists of moves.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Results:**
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000`
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Draw') = 1.0000`

- **Verification:**
  - The results are contradictory (`Player 2` and `Draw` cannot both be true simultaneously). This indicates a logical error in the `determine_winner/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `determine_winner/3`
  - **Code Block:**
    ```prolog
    determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
    ```
  - **Issue:** The predicate does not handle the case where `Score = 0` correctly. The disjunction (`;`) allows multiple solutions, leading to contradictory results.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog:**
  - The recursive logic in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct and terminates properly.
  - The error arises from the non-exclusive conditions in `determine_winner/3`. The predicate should enforce mutual exclusivity (e.g., using `if-then-else` or `cut`).

- **ProbLog:**
  - The probabilistic results (`1.0000`) suggest deterministic behavior, but the contradiction violates probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(A) + P(¬A) = 1`).
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core logic is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails to enforce exclusivity.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the small input size.
  - No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Contradictory results in `determine_winner/3` | Incorrect winner determination | Use exclusive conditions (e.g., `if-then-else` or `cut`) to ensure mutual exclusivity. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves`.                          |
| 3   | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Limited to classical reasoning | Extend with probabilistic facts (e.g., biased moves) if needed.            |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code requires fixes in `determine_winner/3` to ensure correct and exclusive results. Edge cases and probabilistic extensions can be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
