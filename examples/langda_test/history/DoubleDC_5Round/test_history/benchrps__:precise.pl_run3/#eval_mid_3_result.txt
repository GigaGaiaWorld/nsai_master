### **Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and calculating the overall score. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic constraints.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `determine_winner/3`  
  - **Error Location**: Line 41, column 77.  
  - **Issue**: The error suggests an unsupported control construct (`->/2`) in ProbLog.  
  - **Code Block**:  
    ```prolog
    determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
    ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The `->/2` operator (if-then) is not supported in ProbLog. This breaks the declarative semantics required for probabilistic reasoning.  
  - **Fix**: Replace the `->/2` construct with a supported alternative, such as nested `if-else` conditions using `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)`.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic correctness checks are needed.  
  - **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic for `result/3` and `play/3` is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails due to unsupported syntax.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or mismatched lengths for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` in ProbLog    | Predicate fails to execute      | Replace with nested `if-else` conditions   |
| 2   | No input validation              | May crash on invalid inputs     | Add checks for list inputs and lengths     |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the `determine_winner/3` predicate with:  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
  play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
  compute_score(Results, Score), 
  (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
   Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
   Winner = 'Draw').
```
