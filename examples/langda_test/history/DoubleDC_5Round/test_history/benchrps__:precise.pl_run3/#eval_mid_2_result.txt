### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the logic, test results, and adherence to functional requirements, including classical reasoning and probabilistic inference. The main predicate `determine_winner/3` calculates the winner based on two lists of moves.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Results:**
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000`
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Draw') = 1.0000`

- **Verification:**
  - The results are contradictory (`Player 2` and `Draw` cannot both be true simultaneously). This indicates a logical error in the `determine_winner/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `determine_winner/3`
  - **Code Block:**
    ```prolog
    determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
    ```
  - **Issue:** The predicate does not handle the case where `Score = 0` correctly. The disjunction (`;`) allows multiple solutions, leading to contradictory results.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog:**
  - The recursive logic in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct and terminates properly.
  - The error arises from the non-exclusive conditions in `determine_winner/3`. The predicate should enforce mutual exclusivity (e.g., using `if-then-else` or `cut`).

- **ProbLog:**
  - The probabilistic results (`1.0000`) suggest deterministic behavior, but the contradiction violates probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(A) + P(Â¬A) = 1`).
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core logic is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails to enforce exclusivity.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the small input size.
  - No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Contradictory results in `determine_winner/3` | Incorrect winner determination | Use exclusive conditions (e.g., `if-then-else` or `cut`) to ensure mutual exclusivity. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves`.                          |
| 3   | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Limited to classical reasoning | Extend with probabilistic facts (e.g., biased moves) if needed.            |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code requires fixes in `determine_winner/3` to ensure correct and exclusive results. Edge cases and probabilistic extensions can be addressed for robustness.
