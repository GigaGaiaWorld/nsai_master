### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap movement. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while accounting for probabilistic wind effects and actuator strengths.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a **ParseError** during evaluation:  
```  
Error evaluating Problog model:  
Expected binary operator at 33:198.  
```  
- **Failed Queries**: None executed due to the parsing error.  
- **Impact**: The model cannot be evaluated until the syntax error is resolved.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**: The error occurs at line 33, character 198, in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.  
- **Root Cause**: The ternary operator `(G - PrevPos > 0 ? Strength : -Strength)` is not supported in ProbLog. ProbLog requires explicit binary operators (e.g., `>, <, =:=`) and does not support ternary conditional expressions.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The ternary operator is invalid in Prolog/ProbLog. The logic must be rewritten using explicit conditions (e.g., `if-then-else` via `(Condition -> Action ; Alternative)`).  
- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - The probabilistic rules (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined, but the arithmetic logic violates ProbLog's syntax constraints.  
  - ProbLog does not support imperative constructs like ternary operators.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (flap movement logic is flawed).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly modeled (actuator and wind probabilities).  
  - **DeepProbLog**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-integer inputs for `legal_flap_position` are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is avoided due to the fixed time steps (`at(5)`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |  
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| 1   | Ternary operator in ProbLog      | Code cannot be parsed           | Replace with explicit `(G - PrevPos > 0 -> Strength ; -Strength)`          |  
| 2   | Unsupported syntax               | ProbLog parser fails            | Use only supported binary operators (`>, <, =:=`) and avoid ternary logic. |

#### **8. Corrected Code Snippet**  
```prolog  
attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-  
    Time > 0,  
    Prev is Time-1,  
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),  
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),  
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator),  
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),  
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),  
    goal(G),  
    (G - PrevPos > 0 -> Delta is Strength ; Delta is -Strength),  
    Pos is PrevPos + Delta + WindEffect.  
```  

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The error stems from unsupported syntax in ProbLog. Once corrected, the model should execute as intended, combining probabilistic and deterministic reasoning. No DeepProbLog features are required for this task.
