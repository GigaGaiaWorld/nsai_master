<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap movement. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while accounting for probabilistic wind effects and actuator strengths.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a **ParseError** during evaluation:  
```  
Error evaluating Problog model:  
Expected binary operator at 33:198.  
```  
- **Failed Queries**: None executed due to the parsing error.  
- **Impact**: The model cannot be evaluated until the syntax error is resolved.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**: The error occurs at line 33, character 198, in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.  
- **Root Cause**: The ternary operator `(G - PrevPos > 0 ? Strength : -Strength)` is not supported in ProbLog. ProbLog requires explicit binary operators (e.g., `>, <, =:=`) and does not support ternary conditional expressions.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The ternary operator is invalid in Prolog/ProbLog. The logic must be rewritten using explicit conditions (e.g., `if-then-else` via `(Condition -> Action ; Alternative)`).  
- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - The probabilistic rules (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined, but the arithmetic logic violates ProbLog's syntax constraints.  
  - ProbLog does not support imperative constructs like ternary operators.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (flap movement logic is flawed).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly modeled (actuator and wind probabilities).  
  - **DeepProbLog**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-integer inputs for `legal_flap_position` are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is avoided due to the fixed time steps (`at(5)`).  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |  
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| 1   | Ternary operator in ProbLog      | Code cannot be parsed           | Replace with explicit `(G - PrevPos > 0 -> Strength ; -Strength)`          |  
| 2   | Unsupported syntax               | ProbLog parser fails            | Use only supported binary operators (`>, <, =:=`) and avoid ternary logic. |  

---

#### **8. Corrected Code Snippet**  
```prolog  
attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-  
    Time > 0,  
    Prev is Time-1,  
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),  
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),  
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator),  
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),  
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),  
    goal(G),  
    (G - PrevPos > 0 -> Delta is Strength ; Delta is -Strength),  
    Pos is PrevPos + Delta + WindEffect.  
```  

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The error stems from unsupported syntax in ProbLog. Once corrected, the model should execute as intended, combining probabilistic and deterministic reasoning. No DeepProbLog features are required for this task.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
