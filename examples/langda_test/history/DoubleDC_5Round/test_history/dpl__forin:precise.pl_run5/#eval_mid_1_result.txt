# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

## 1. Document Title
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

## 2. Background and Purpose
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

## 3. Test Results Summary
- **Query Tested**: `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`
- **Result**: `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability is correctly computed as 1.0, indicating deterministic success.

## 4. Failure Localization
- **No Failures Detected**: The implementation correctly handles the provided test case. No discrepancies between actual and expected results were found.

## 5. Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Analysis
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicate `insertion_sort/2` recursively sorts the tail of the list and inserts the head into the sorted tail using `insert_element/3`. The base case (`insertion_sort([], [])`) ensures termination.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates when the input list is empty, as guaranteed by the base case.

### ProbLog Analysis
- **Probabilistic Facts**: No probabilistic facts are used in this implementation. The result is deterministic, as evidenced by the probability `1.0000`.
- **DeepProbLog Features**: Not applicable (no neural network calls or tensor operations).

## 6. Overall Analysis
### Functional Requirements
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using insertion sort.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not explicitly used in this example.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.

### Edge Cases
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the base case.
- **Performance**: Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow, but this is inherent to the algorithm and not a code-specific issue.

## 7. Error Summary
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Runtime errors | Add input validation for list type. |
| 2      | Deep recursion | Potential stack overflow | Consider iterative approaches for large datasets. |

### Code Block
```prolog
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted).

insert_element(X, [], [X]).
insert_element(X, [H|T], [X,H|T]) :-
    X =< H.
insert_element(X, [H|T], [H|RT]) :-
    X > H,
    insert_element(X, T, RT).
```

### Table: Test Results
| Query | Expected Result | Actual Result | Probability |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| `insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` | `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` | `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` | `1.0000` |
