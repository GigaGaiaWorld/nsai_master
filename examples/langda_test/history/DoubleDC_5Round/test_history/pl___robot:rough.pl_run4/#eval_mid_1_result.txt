### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves to different locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure it meets the functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5572`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3700`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilistic outcomes based on the defined rules and facts.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned probabilities consistent with the defined rules and probabilistic facts.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive predicates (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) terminate correctly as they include base cases and recursive calls with decreasing time steps (`s(T)`).  
- Logical correctness is ensured by the proper use of negation (`\+`) and conjunction/disjunction in rules.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The computation of probabilities adheres to the rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is correctly implemented (e.g., `0.3::pickup_fails(T)` complements `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`).  
  - Implications are handled via conjunction and disjunction (e.g., `drops(key,T)` rules).  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used, as reported: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed as expected.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** The code does not use undefined predicates.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable (no list operations).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the time steps (`s(T)`), ensuring performance is not an issue.

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the test results confirm its correctness. No improvements are necessary for the current implementation.
