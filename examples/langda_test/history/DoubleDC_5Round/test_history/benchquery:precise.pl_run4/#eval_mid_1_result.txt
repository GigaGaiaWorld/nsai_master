### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Query for Population Density Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division and employs inequalities to approximate density ratios. The test results show successful queries, but a thorough evaluation is required to ensure correctness and robustness.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate the following successful queries with a probability of `1.0000`:
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246])`
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219])`
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223])`
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77])`
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461])`
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244])`
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477])`
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76])`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected output, confirming that the code correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:
- **`query_pop/1`**: Correctly implements the inequality constraints (`20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1`) to approximate density ratios.
- **`density/2`**: Accurately calculates population density using integer arithmetic (`D is (P * 100) // A`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are logically sound. The inequalities ensure that the density ratios are within the specified range (approximately 1.05).
- **Recursive Termination**: No recursion is used, so termination is not an issue.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required. The results are deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly queries and filters countries based on population density.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates**: All predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`, `query_pop/1`) are defined.
- **Non-list Input**: The input format for `query_pop/1` is fixed as `[C1,D1,C2,D2]`, and no edge cases violate this.
- **Performance**: The code is efficient, with no deep recursion or performance bottlenecks.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is correct, efficient, and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified during the evaluation.
