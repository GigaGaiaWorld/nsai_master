### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, verify test results, and analyze adherence to ProbLog's logical and probabilistic constraints.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with probability `1.0000`.  
- **Verification:** The test passes as the output matches the expected sorted list.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected. The implementation correctly adheres to the requirements:  
  1. Recursively sorts the tail list.  
  2. Inserts the head element into the sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) correctly handles empty lists.  
  - The recursive case (`insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted)`) ensures the tail is sorted before inserting the head.  
  - The `insert_element/3` predicate correctly places the head in the sorted list.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates as the tail list shrinks with each recursive call.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code.  
  - The result probability `1.0000` indicates deterministic behavior.  

- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **Not used.** The code does not integrate neural networks (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Satisfied   | The code correctly implements insertion sort in Prolog.                     |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used  | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error        | Add input validation for list type.        |
| 2   | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow       | Optimize for tail recursion or use loops.  |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The insertion sort implementation in ProbLog is logically correct and passes all provided tests. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
