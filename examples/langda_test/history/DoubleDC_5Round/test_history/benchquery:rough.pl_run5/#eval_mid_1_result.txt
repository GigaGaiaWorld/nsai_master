### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Population Density Query**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within a 5% margin). The code defines a `density/2` predicate to calculate density and a `query_pop/1` predicate to find matching pairs. The test results show successful queries, but a thorough evaluation is required to ensure correctness and robustness.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following successful queries (all with probability `1.0000`):  
1. `query_pop([china, 2.440828402366864, france, 2.464788732394366])`  
2. `query_pop([indonesia, 2.23859649122807, pakistan, 2.192926045016077])`  
3. `query_pop([pakistan, 2.192926045016077, indonesia, 2.23859649122807])`  
4. `query_pop([mexico, 0.760471204188482, ethiopia, 0.777142857142857])`  
5. `query_pop([italy, 4.775862068965517, philippines, 4.611111111111111])`  
6. `query_pop([france, 2.464788732394366, china, 2.440828402366864])`  
7. `query_pop([philippines, 4.611111111111111, italy, 4.775862068965517])`  
8. `query_pop([ethiopia, 0.777142857142857, mexico, 0.760471204188482])`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the requirement of finding pairs with density differences ≤ 5%.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `density/2` and `query_pop/1` are correctly defined and function as intended.  

- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  density(Country, Density) :- pop(Country, Pop), area(Country, Area), Density is Pop / Area.
  query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :- 
      density(Country1, Density1), 
      density(Country2, Density2), 
      Country1 \= Country2, 
      abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05.
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates population density.  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures pairs are distinct (`Country1 \= Country2`) and checks the 5% density difference condition.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). It operates in a purely deterministic Prolog context.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly queries and filters pairs based on population density.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid country names in `pop/2` and `area/2`. Undefined inputs would fail silently.  
  - **Non-list Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list. Non-list inputs would cause a type error.  
  - **Performance:** The current implementation is efficient for the given dataset but may scale poorly for larger databases due to the quadratic nature of pairwise comparisons.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | No probabilistic features used | Limited to deterministic queries | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |
| 2   | No input validation | May fail silently for invalid inputs | Add checks for valid country names. |
| 3   | Quadratic complexity | Poor scalability for large datasets | Optimize with indexing or filtering. |
