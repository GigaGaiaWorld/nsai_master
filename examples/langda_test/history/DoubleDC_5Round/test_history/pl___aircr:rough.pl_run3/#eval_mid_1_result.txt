### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller: Error Diagnosis and Recommendations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating the movement of flaps under probabilistic conditions (actuator choice, wind effects). The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within 5 time steps. The code includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and legal flap positions. However, an error (`Expected binary operator`) was encountered during evaluation.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Error Encountered**:  
  ```plaintext
  ParseError: Expected binary operator at 33:198.
  ```
  - The error occurs during parsing, indicating a syntax issue in the code.
- **Queries**:  
  - `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` for `T` between `1` and `5`.  
  - No results were generated due to the parsing error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**:  
  - The error points to line 33, column 198 in the code. This corresponds to the ternary operator (`? :`) in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate:
    ```prolog
    Pos is PrevPos + (G - PrevPos > 0 ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect.
    ```
  - **Issue**: ProbLog does not support ternary operators (`? :`). This is a Prolog feature not available in ProbLog's syntax.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog vs. ProbLog**:  
  - The ternary operator is valid in Prolog but unsupported in ProbLog. ProbLog restricts control constructs to maintain declarative semantics.
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**:  
  - The probabilistic rules (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and does not affect probabilistic reasoning.
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (error prevents execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly modeled but untested due to error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The ternary operator is an edge case in ProbLog syntax.  
  - Recursive termination is correct (base case `Time > 0` is enforced).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Ternary operator (`? :`) unsupported in ProbLog | Code fails to parse | Replace with `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` or nested `if-then-else` logic. |
| 2 | ProbLog syntax restrictions | Limited control constructs | Use supported constructs (e.g., `(G - PrevPos > 0, Pos is PrevPos + Strength ; Pos is PrevPos - Strength)`). |

---

### **Recommendations**  
1. **Replace Ternary Operator**:  
   ```prolog
   attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
     Time > 0,
     Prev is Time-1,
     flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
     goal(G),
     \+ goal_reached(Prev),
     use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
     actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
     wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
     (G - PrevPos > 0 -> 
         Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect
     ; 
         Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect
     ).
   ```
2. **Verify Probabilistic Rules**:  
   - Ensure all probabilistic facts (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined.  

3. **Test After Fix**:  
   - Re-run queries to verify `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` probabilities.
