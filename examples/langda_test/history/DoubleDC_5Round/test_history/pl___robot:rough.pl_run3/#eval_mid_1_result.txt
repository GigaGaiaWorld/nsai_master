### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot attempts to pick up a key and move between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like `pickup_succeeds`, `drops`, and `goto_succeeds`. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the code and its test results.  
- Identify and analyze failures.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a parsing error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = action(s, pos)
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unexpected character '.' at 30:86.
```  
- **Failed Queries**: None executed due to the parsing error.  
- **Impact**: The entire model fails to evaluate, preventing any query results.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**: Line 30, character 86.  
- **Root Cause**: The parser encountered an unexpected `.` character, likely due to a syntax violation in the ProbLog rules.  
- **Affected Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-    goto_succeeds(T),    goto_action(T),    \+ at(robot, Pos, T).at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-    goto_fails(T),    goto_action(T),    at(robot, Pos, T).
  ```  
  - **Issue**: Missing line breaks or incorrect formatting between the two `at/3` predicates.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog**:  
  - The logical structure of the rules (e.g., recursion in `carrying/2` and `slippery/2`) is correct.  
  - Termination is ensured by base cases like `slippery(key,0)`.  
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - Probabilities (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`) comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - Negations (e.g., `\+ drops(key, T)`) are correctly used.  
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met (e.g., `carrying/2` and `at/3` predicates).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met (e.g., probabilistic facts and rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2` or non-list inputs are not a concern here.  
  - Deep recursion is avoided due to base cases.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unexpected `.` character in parser | Model fails to evaluate | Fix formatting by separating predicates with line breaks. |
| 2 | Missing line breaks in `at/3` rules | Syntax error | Rewrite the `at/3` predicates on separate lines. |

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
1. **Fix Syntax**: Separate the `at/3` predicates with line breaks:  
   ```prolog
   at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_succeeds(T), goto_action(T), \+ at(robot, Pos, T).
   at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_fails(T), goto_action(T), at(robot, Pos, T).
   ```  
2. **Re-run Tests**: Verify the corrected code with the same queries.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.
