### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation against the provided test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test result provided is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification**: The output matches the expected solution for the Zebra Puzzle, satisfying all constraints.
- **Conclusion**: **All tests passed (no failures)**. The code correctly implements the puzzle's requirements.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules are correctly defined and executed as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are logically sound and terminate correctly.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) are well-defined and terminate for valid inputs.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic computations are involved.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used. **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code solves the puzzle using deterministic logic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.
- **Non-list Input**: The input is constrained to a list of houses, so non-list inputs are not a concern.
- **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and adheres to ProbLog's syntax and semantics. No improvements are necessary for the given requirements. The absence of probabilistic or neural network features suggests the code is purely classical Prolog.
