<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation against the provided test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test result provided is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification**: The output matches the expected solution for the Zebra Puzzle, satisfying all constraints.
- **Conclusion**: **All tests passed (no failures)**. The code correctly implements the puzzle's requirements.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules are correctly defined and executed as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are logically sound and terminate correctly.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) are well-defined and terminate for valid inputs.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic computations are involved.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used. **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code solves the puzzle using deterministic logic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.
- **Non-list Input**: The input is constrained to a list of houses, so non-list inputs are not a concern.
- **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and adheres to ProbLog's syntax and semantics. No improvements are necessary for the given requirements. The absence of probabilistic or neural network features suggests the code is purely classical Prolog. 

**Word Count**: 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
</Final_Answer>
