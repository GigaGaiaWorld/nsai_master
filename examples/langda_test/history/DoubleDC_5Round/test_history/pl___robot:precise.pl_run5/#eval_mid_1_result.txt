### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a robot's behavior in a dynamic environment where it can pick up, carry, and drop a key. The scenario includes probabilistic events such as successful/failed actions (e.g., `goto`, `pickup`) and environmental conditions (e.g., `slippery` key). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the code against the given test results.  
- Analyze logical and probabilistic consistency.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.4331`  
- `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.9000`  
- `at(robot, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0900`  
- `at(robot, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0100`  
- `at(key, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.5670`  
- `at(key, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.4330`  
- `at(key, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key dynamics under probabilistic conditions.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `at/3` for the robot and key are correctly defined, and the probabilistic rules (e.g., `pickup_succeeds`, `goto_succeeds`) adhere to the requirements.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive definitions for `carrying/2` and `at/3` terminate correctly. For example:  
  - `carrying(key, s(T))` terminates when `T` reaches the base case (`0`).  
  - `at/3` predicates handle all edge cases (e.g., no `goto` action).  

- **Negation-as-Failure:** The use of `\+` (negation) is stratified and does not violate ProbLog’s declarative semantics.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds`, `goto_succeeds`, etc., comply with the rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` (e.g., `pickup_fails(T) = 1 − 0.7 = 0.3`).  
  - Implicit independence assumptions (e.g., `pickup_succeeds` and `goto_succeeds` are independent).  

- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Predicates correctly model robot/key dynamics.                              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met      | Probabilities are computed as expected.                                     |
| Neural Network Integration | N/A    | No DeepProbLog features used.                                              |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates are defined.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable (up to `s(s(s(0)))`).
