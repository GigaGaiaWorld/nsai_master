<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant must choose between three doors, one of which hides a prize. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The ProbLog implementation provided aims to model this scenario and compute the probabilities of winning by either keeping the initial choice or switching.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided ProbLog code are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- The initial door selection (`select_door(1)`) is deterministic and correct.  
- The probabilities for `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the expected outcomes (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. All predicates and rules adhere to the requirements:  
- The `open_door/1` rules correctly handle the cases where:  
  - Two doors are unselected and empty (random selection with probability 0.5).  
  - Only one door is unselected and empty (deterministic selection).  
- The `win_keep` and `win_switch` predicates accurately reflect the game's logic.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly implemented for list traversal.  
- Recursive termination is ensured as the base case (`member(X, [X|T])`) and recursive case (`member(X, [H|T])`) are properly defined.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilistic facts (`1/3::prize/1`) and rules (`0.5::open_door/1`) comply with probabilistic rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled via negation-as-failure (`\+`).  
  - The disjunction (`;`) in `open_door/1` ensures fair randomness.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `member/2`, deterministic rules).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., uniform prize distribution, fair host behavior).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases such as:  
  - Only one unselected empty door (deterministic opening).  
  - Two unselected empty doors (random opening).  
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.  

**Performance:**  
- The recursion depth is minimal (maximum of 3 doors), ensuring efficient execution.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | None    | N/A    | N/A        |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem is correct, efficient, and adheres to both classical and probabilistic logic requirements. No improvements are necessary for the given scope.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
