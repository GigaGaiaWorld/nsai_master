#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant must choose between three doors, one of which hides a prize. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The ProbLog implementation provided aims to model this scenario and compute the probabilities of winning by either keeping the initial choice or switching.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided ProbLog code are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- The initial door selection (`select_door(1)`) is deterministic and correct.  
- The probabilities for `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the expected outcomes (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. All predicates and rules adhere to the requirements:  
- The `open_door/1` rules correctly handle the cases where:  
  - Two doors are unselected and empty (random selection with probability 0.5).  
  - Only one door is unselected and empty (deterministic selection).  
- The `win_keep` and `win_switch` predicates accurately reflect the game's logic.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly implemented for list traversal.  
- Recursive termination is ensured as the base case (`member(X, [X|T])`) and recursive case (`member(X, [H|T])`) are properly defined.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilistic facts (`1/3::prize/1`) and rules (`0.5::open_door/1`) comply with probabilistic rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled via negation-as-failure (`\+`).  
  - The disjunction (`;`) in `open_door/1` ensures fair randomness.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `member/2`, deterministic rules).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., uniform prize distribution, fair host behavior).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases such as:  
  - Only one unselected empty door (deterministic opening).  
  - Two unselected empty doors (random opening).  
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.  

**Performance:**  
- The recursion depth is minimal (maximum of 3 doors), ensuring efficient execution.

**Final Remarks:**  
The ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem is correct, efficient, and adheres to both classical and probabilistic logic requirements. No improvements are necessary for the given scope.
