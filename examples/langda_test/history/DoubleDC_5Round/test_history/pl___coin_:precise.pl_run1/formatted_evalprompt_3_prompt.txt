<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code with Error Diagnosis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss experiment where a counter (`CNT`) decrements from a starting value (e.g., 4) to 0. For each step, if the `CNT`-th coin lands heads (`coin(CNT)`), the success count (`SC`) increments by 1. The final accumulated count is stored in `S`. The code fails with an `UnknownClause` error, indicating a syntax or semantic issue.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
  ```  
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to an unsupported control construct (`->/2`).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate:** `coins_r/3`  
  - **Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    (coin(CNT) -> 
        NewSC is SC + 1,
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT)
    ; 
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT)
    ).
    ```  
  - **Line Numbers:** 8–16 (approximate)  
- **Issue:** ProbLog does not support the Prolog `->/2` (if-then) operator.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The logic is sound in Prolog but violates ProbLog's constraints. The `->/2` operator is unsupported because it breaks declarative semantics.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  The code uses probabilistic facts (`coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8)`), but the control structure is invalid.  
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but syntax is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met for facts but not for control flow.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-integer `CNT` values or negative counts are unhandled.  
  - Deep recursion could cause stack issues for large `CNT`.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|---|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1 | Unsupported `->/2` operator | Code fails to execute | Replace `->/2` with `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)` |  
| 2 | Undefined edge cases | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for `CNT` (e.g., `integer(CNT), CNT >= 0`) |  

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**  
```prolog
coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT), 
        NewSC is SC + 1,
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT)
    ; 
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT)
    ).
```

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
