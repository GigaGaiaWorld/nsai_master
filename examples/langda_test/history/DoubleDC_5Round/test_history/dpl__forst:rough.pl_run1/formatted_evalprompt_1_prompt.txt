</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Stack Operations Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation through test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 1, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected outputs for each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are logically sound. Each operation correctly manipulates the stack as per its definition.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `insertion_sort` predicate ensures termination by recursively processing the list until it is empty.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. All operations are deterministic, and the results are confirmed with a probability of 1.0000.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations are correctly implemented and tested.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The `insertion_sort` predicate may face performance issues with large lists due to its recursive nature.
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates or edge cases were overlooked in the provided code.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation of stack operations in ProbLog is correct and adheres to the specified requirements. The code is logically sound and passes all test cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, and the focus remains on classical reasoning. Edge cases such as non-list inputs should be handled in future iterations for robustness. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
