**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation models the problem and evaluates the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (each door has an equal chance of hiding the prize).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic (as expected).
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 for keeping, 2/3 for switching).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- `open_door/1` correctly handles both scenarios (randomly opening an empty door or definitively opening the empty door).
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` accurately reflect the winning conditions.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Logical Correctness:**
- The rules for `open_door/1` ensure the host's behavior complies with the problem's requirements:
  - When both unselected doors are empty, one is opened randomly (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).
  - When one unselected door has a prize, the host opens the other (`open_door(A)`).
- The winning conditions (`win_keep`, `win_switch`) are logically sound and terminate correctly.

**Probabilistic Correctness:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are uniformly distributed (`1/3` each).
- The negation `\+ prize(A)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.
- The disjunction in `open_door/1` correctly models the host's random choice.

**DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (e.g., `prize/1`, `open_door/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined Predicates:** None detected.
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable (input is fixed).
- **Recursive Performance:** `member/2` is efficient for small lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:**
The implementation is correct and aligns with the theoretical expectations of the Monty Hall problem. No issues were identified in the code or test results. The probabilistic and logical components are well-defined and function as intended.
