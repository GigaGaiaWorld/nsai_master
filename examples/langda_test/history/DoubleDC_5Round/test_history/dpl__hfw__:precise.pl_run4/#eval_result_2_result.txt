{"HASH": "9BA21093","ErrorSummary": "The parse/2 predicate for addition is correct but incomplete as it doesn't cover all required operations (subtraction, multiplication, division)","SuggestedFix": "Add three more parse/2 predicates to handle subtraction, multiplication, and division operations following the same pattern as the addition case. For example: parse([N1, - | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(N1 - R2, R).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
