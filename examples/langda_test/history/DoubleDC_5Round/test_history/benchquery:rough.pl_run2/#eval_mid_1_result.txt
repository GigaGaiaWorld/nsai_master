### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Population Density Query

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within a 5% margin). The code defines a `density/2` predicate to calculate density and a `query_pop/1` predicate to find matching pairs. The test results show successful queries, and this report evaluates the correctness and robustness of the implementation.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
All test queries passed successfully. Below are the results:  

| Query Pair | Probability |
|------------|-------------|
| `query_pop([china, 244.0828402366864, france, 246.4788732394366])` | 1.0000 |
| `query_pop([indonesia, 223.859649122807, pakistan, 219.2926045016077])` | 1.0000 |
| `query_pop([pakistan, 219.2926045016077, indonesia, 223.859649122807])` | 1.0000 |
| `query_pop([mexico, 76.04712041884817, ethiopia, 77.71428571428571])` | 1.0000 |
| `query_pop([italy, 477.58620689655174, philippines, 461.1111111111111])` | 1.0000 |
| `query_pop([france, 246.4788732394366, china, 244.0828402366864])` | 1.0000 |
| `query_pop([philippines, 461.1111111111111, italy, 477.58620689655174])` | 1.0000 |
| `query_pop([ethiopia, 77.71428571428571, mexico, 76.04712041884817])` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the logic for calculating and comparing population densities is correct.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `density/2` and `query_pop/1` are correctly implemented, and the test results align with the expected behavior.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates population density using the formula `Density = (Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000)`.  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures pairs are distinct (`Country1 \= Country2`) and checks if the difference in densities is within 5% of their average (`Diff =< MaxDiff`).  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - No recursion is used, so termination is not an issue.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. It operates purely deterministically.  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly queries and compares population densities.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs for `pop/2` and `area/2`. Undefined countries or missing data would fail silently.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list. Non-list inputs would cause a type error.  
- **Performance:** The current implementation is efficient for the given dataset but may scale poorly for larger databases due to the quadratic complexity of comparing all pairs.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | No input validation | May fail silently for invalid inputs | Add checks for valid countries and data. |
| 2   | Scalability | Quadratic complexity for large datasets | Optimize with indexing or filtering. |
| 3   | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic queries | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |
