### **Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code Evaluation Report**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under probabilistic actuator and wind conditions, aiming to reach a goal position while avoiding overrun exceptions. This report evaluates the code's correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and edge-case handling.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  

| Query                  | Probability Result |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`      | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`      | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`      | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`      | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`      | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with expected behavior, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions remain minimal.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:  
- `legal_flap_position/1` (line 2)  
- `actuator_strength/2` (lines 4-5)  
- `use_actuator/2` (line 7)  
- `wind_effect/2` (lines 10-11)  
- `flap_position/2` (lines 14-16)  
- `overrun_exception/1` (lines 18-19)  
- `goal_reached/1` (lines 21-22)  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `sign/1`, `between/3`) are correctly used in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code ensures termination by limiting steps to `at(5)` and correctly checks for goal satisfaction (`goal_reached/1`).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `attempted_flap_position/2` is bounded by `Time > 0` and `Prev is Time-1`.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `use_actuator/2` and `wind_effect/2` comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
- **Negation/Implication:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` (line 18) adheres to probabilistic rules.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this example.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models flap movement and goal checking.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for actuators and wind effects are correctly computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this example.  
- **Non-list Input:** The input is constrained to integers (e.g., `between(0,10,FP)`).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.
