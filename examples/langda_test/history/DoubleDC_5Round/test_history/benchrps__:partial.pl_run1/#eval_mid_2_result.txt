### **Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.  
- Analyze edge cases and potential failures.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000, as `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once.  

**All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- **Predicates Verified**:  
  - `move/1` (lines 1–3).  
  - `beats/2` (lines 4–6).  
  - `result/3` (lines 7–12).  
  - `play/3` (lines 13–16).  
  - `compute_score/2` (lines 17–20).  
  - `determine_winner/3` (lines 21–25).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` correctly model the game's win-lose relationships.  
  - Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate properly with base cases.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements deterministic game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes lists as input; non-list inputs would fail.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance is linear with the length of the move lists.  
  - **Undefined Moves**: The `move/1` predicate restricts inputs to `rock`, `paper`, and `scissor`.
