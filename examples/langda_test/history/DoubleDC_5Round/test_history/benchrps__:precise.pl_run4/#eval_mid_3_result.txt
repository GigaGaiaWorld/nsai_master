### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code: Functional and Logical Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the overall winner based on a list of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the logic and test results.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
**Query Tested:**
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Results:**
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],'Player 2') = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],'Draw') = 1.0000`

**Analysis:**
- The results are contradictory because the same query cannot yield both `'Player 2'` and `'Draw'` as winners with probability `1.0000`. This indicates a logical error in the `determine_winner/3` predicate.

**Conclusion:**
- **Test Failed**: The query does not produce consistent results.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Predicate:**
- `determine_winner/3` (Line: Not explicitly numbered, but the issue lies in the predicate definition).

**Issue:**
- The predicate `determine_winner/3` incorrectly allows both `'Player 2'` and `'Draw'` to be valid outputs for the same input. This is due to the disjunction (`;`) in the predicate definition, which does not enforce mutual exclusivity.

**Code Block with Issue:**
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Context:**
- The logical error arises because the disjunction (`;`) in `determine_winner/3` does not ensure that only one condition is true at a time. For example, if `Score = 0`, the predicate will bind `Winner` to `'Draw'`, but if `Score < 0`, it will also bind `Winner` to `'Player 2'`.

**Probabilistic Context:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so the issue is purely logical. However, if probabilistic reasoning were involved, the incorrect disjunction would lead to incorrect probability distributions.

**DeepProbLog:**
- **Not Used**: The code does not involve neural network integration or DeepProbLog features.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic for determining the winner is flawed.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.
- **Empty Lists**: The `play/3` predicate correctly handles empty lists, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate does not explicitly account for them.
- **Deep Recursion**: No performance issues observed, but the recursion depth is limited by the input list length.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Logical error in `determine_winner/3` | Incorrect winner determination | Replace disjunction with mutually exclusive conditions. |
| 2   | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 3   | Empty list handling | Unclear behavior | Explicitly handle empty lists in `determine_winner/3`. |

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires revision to fix the logical error in `determine_winner/3` and to handle edge cases more robustly. The rest of the implementation (e.g., `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correct.
