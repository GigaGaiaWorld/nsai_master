### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation and Error Resolution**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort` algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics. The test results indicate an `UnknownClause` error, which requires detailed analysis.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 3:15.
  ```  
- **Failure**: The query fails due to an unsupported control construct (`->/2`) in ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `bubble/3`  
- **Error Location**: Line 3, Column 15  
- **Issue**:  
  The `->/2` (if-then-else) construct is not supported in ProbLog. This construct breaks the declarative semantics required for probabilistic reasoning.  
- **Affected Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :-
      (H1 =< H2 -> X1 = H1, bubble([H2 | T], T1, X);
       X1 = H2, bubble([H1 | T], T1, X)).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The logic is correct for standard Prolog, but the `->/2` construct is not allowed in ProbLog.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured as the base case (`bubble([X], [], X)`) is correctly defined.  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog does not support imperative control constructs like `->/2`.  
  - The error occurs because ProbLog expects purely declarative logic for probabilistic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails due to unsupported construct).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: Not handled (e.g., `forth_sort(3, X)` would fail).  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported `->/2` construct | Query fails | Replace with `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)` |
| 2 | No probabilistic facts/rules | Limited to classical Prolog | Add probabilistic annotations if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | May crash on invalid input | Add guards for list inputs |

---

### **Recommendations**  
1. **Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic**:  
   ```prolog
   bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :-
       (H1 =< H2, X1 = H1, bubble([H2 | T], T1, X));
       (H1 > H2, X1 = H2, bubble([H1 | T], T1, X)).
   ```  
2. **Add input validation**:  
   ```prolog
   forth_sort(L, L2) :- is_list(L), bubblesort(L, [], L2).
   ```  
3. **Test with ProbLog-compatible queries**:  
   ```prolog
   query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
   ```
