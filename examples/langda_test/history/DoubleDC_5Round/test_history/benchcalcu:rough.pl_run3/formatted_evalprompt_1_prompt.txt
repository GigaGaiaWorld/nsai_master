<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digits for the variables `A, B, C, D, E` such that the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` holds. The code uses classical Prolog predicates for digit constraints, uniqueness checks, and column-wise addition simulation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and logical rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`. All solutions returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic success. Here are the results:

```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly enforces the constraints of the puzzle and generates valid solutions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates used (`leftdigit/1`, `digit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The predicates ensure that:
    - The first digits (`A, B, C`) are non-zero (`leftdigit/1`).
    - All digits are unique (`all_different/1`).
    - Column-wise addition with carry is correctly simulated (`sumdigit/5`).
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates because the list shrinks with each recursive call, and `member/2` ensures no infinite loops.

- **ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required. The results are deterministic.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle using classical Prolog constraints.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Predicates:** None.
  - **Non-list Input:** The input to `query_sum/1` is a list of variables, and the code enforces the correct structure.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to the length of the digit list (5), so performance is not an issue.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code is well-structured and meets all requirements for solving the cryptoaddition puzzle. It adheres to classical Prolog rules and generates valid solutions. No improvements are necessary for the given problem. If probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are required in the future, the code can be extended accordingly. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
