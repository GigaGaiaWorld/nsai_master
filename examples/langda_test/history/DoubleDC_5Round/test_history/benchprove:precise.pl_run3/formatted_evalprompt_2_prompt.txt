<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extending it with additional logical constructs such as `implies`, `opposite`, `expand`, `includes`, and `extend`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and ensure that all functional requirements are met.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
All test queries passed successfully with the following results:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob))) = 1.0000`  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 1.0000`  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 1.0000`  
- `prove(includes([a,b,c],b)) = 1.0000`  
- `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2])) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined and function as expected in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `implies(P,Q)` predicate correctly implements the logical implication `P ⇒ Q` by checking if `P` is unprovable or `Q` is provable.  
  - The `opposite(P)` predicate correctly implements negation-as-failure (`\+ prove(P)`).  
  - The `expand(A,B)` predicate uses user-defined rules (e.g., `double/2`, `square/2`) to expand `A` into `B`.  
  - The `includes(Set,X)` predicate correctly checks set inclusion using `member/2`.  
  - The `extend(List,Elem,Extended)` predicate correctly prepends `Elem` to `List`.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The `member/2` and `ancestor/2` predicates are well-defined and terminate for finite lists and acyclic graphs, respectively.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**  
  - The negation `opposite(P)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - The implication `implies(P,Q)` adheres to `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`.  
  - No probabilistic facts were used in the provided code, but the framework supports them.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - **Observation:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in the provided code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The meta-interpreter handles classical Prolog constructs and user-defined predicates correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met (no probabilistic facts were tested, but the framework supports them).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog features unused).  

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Undefined `expand/2` Rules:** If `expand(A,B)` is called with an undefined rule, it will fail silently. This could be mitigated by adding a default case or validation.  
- **Non-List Inputs:** The `includes/2` and `extend/3` predicates assume list inputs. Non-list inputs will cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The `ancestor/2` predicate may lead to infinite recursion in cyclic graphs.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Undefined `expand/2` rules | Silent failure | Add default case or validation |
| 2      | Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` | Runtime errors | Add input validation |
| 3      | Deep recursion in `ancestor/2` for cyclic graphs | Infinite recursion | Add cycle detection |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets the classical reasoning requirements. However, edge cases and potential pitfalls should be addressed for robustness. No DeepProbLog features were utilized, but the framework is ready for probabilistic extensions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
