### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are summarized below:

| Query | Result (Probability) | Status |
|-------|----------------------|--------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])` | `1.0000` | Pass |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | `0.0000` | Fail |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | `0.0000` | Fail |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | `0.0000` | Fail |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | `0.0000` | Fail |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], X2)` | `0.0000` | Fail |

**Conclusion**: Only the `push` operation passed. All other operations failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failures are localized to the following predicates and rules:

1. **Failed Queries**:
   - `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot` operations returned `0.0000` (failure).

2. **Missing Predicates**:
   - The code does not define rules for `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, or `rot`. These operations are queried but not implemented.

3. **Code Line Numbers**:
   - The `push` operation is correctly implemented (Line 1).
   - The `sort` operation is partially implemented (Lines 2â€“6), but it is not tested.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

1. **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:
   - The `push` operation is logically correct and terminates properly.
   - The missing operations (`pop`, `dup`, etc.) are not defined, leading to failures.

2. **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:
   - The probabilistic results (`0.0000` for failures) comply with ProbLog's rules. Undefined predicates return `0.0000` (failure).
   - No probabilistic facts or implications are used in the code.

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (only `push` is implemented).
   - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
   - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled.
   - Deep recursion is not a concern here, but undefined operations are a critical oversight.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing `pop` implementation | High | Define `pop` to remove the top element. |
| 2   | Missing `dup` implementation | High | Define `dup` to duplicate the top element. |
| 3   | Missing `swap` implementation | High | Define `swap` to swap the top two elements. |
| 4   | Missing `over` implementation | High | Define `over` to copy the second element to the top. |
| 5   | Missing `rot` implementation | High | Define `rot` to rotate the top three elements. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code partially meets the requirements but lacks implementations for most stack operations. The `push` operation is correct, but the remaining operations must be defined to ensure full functionality. Edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs) should also be addressed.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.
