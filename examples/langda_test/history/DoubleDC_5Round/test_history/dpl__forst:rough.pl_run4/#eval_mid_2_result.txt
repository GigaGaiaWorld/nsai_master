### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are summarized below:

| Query | Result (Probability) | Status |
|-------|----------------------|--------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])` | `1.0000` | Pass |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4])` | `1.0000` | Pass |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 1, 2, 3, 4])` | `1.0000` | Pass |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 3, 4])` | `1.0000` | Pass |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 2, 3, 4])` | `1.0000` | Pass |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 1, 4])` | `1.0000` | Pass |

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly handles all specified stack operations.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**. All operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are correctly implemented and return the expected results with a probability of `1.0000`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

1. **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:
   - The predicates are logically correct and terminate properly. For example:
     - `push` appends an element to the stack.
     - `pop` removes the top element.
     - `dup` duplicates the top element.
     - `swap`, `over`, and `rot` manipulate the top elements as specified.

2. **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:
   - The results comply with ProbLog's probabilistic rules. Since no probabilistic facts or implications are used, the results are deterministic (`1.0000`).

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. All stack operations are correctly implemented.
   - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
   - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not explicitly handled, but the current implementation assumes valid stack inputs.
   - Deep recursion is not a concern here, as the operations are non-recursive.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| -   | No failures detected | - | - |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code fully meets the requirements for classical stack operations in ProbLog. All tests pass, and the implementation is logically sound. Edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs) could be addressed for robustness, but they are not critical for the current scope.  

**Word Count**: 350 words.
