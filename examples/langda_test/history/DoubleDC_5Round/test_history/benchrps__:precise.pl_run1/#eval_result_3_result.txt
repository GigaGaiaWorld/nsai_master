  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the disjunction in determine_winner/3 to enforce mutual exclusivity. Replace the current logic with:\n\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- \n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), \n    compute_score(Results, Score), \n    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';\n     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';\n     Winner = 'Draw').\n\nThis ensures only one outcome is possible per query.",
