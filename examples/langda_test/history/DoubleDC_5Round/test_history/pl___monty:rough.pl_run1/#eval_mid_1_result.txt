#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant chooses one of three doors, behind which lies either a prize or a goat. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens a door that the contestant did not choose and reveals a goat. The contestant is then given the choice to stick with their original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door. Probabilistically, switching doors increases the chances of winning the prize from 1/3 to 2/3.

This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules.
- Verification of test results.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The implementation correctly adheres to the problem's requirements:
1. **Uniform Random Selection:** When two doors are available for Monty to open, the choice is uniformly random (0.5 probability).
2. **Deterministic Selection:** When only one door is available, Monty must open it.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list traversal.
- The `open_door/1` predicate handles both cases (two doors and one door) as required.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly defined (1/3 for each door).
- The negation `\+ prize(Door)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.
- The `findall/3` and `length/2` predicates ensure the correct number of available doors for Monty to open.

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met (e.g., `member/2`, `findall/3`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (e.g., uniform distribution for `prize/1` and `open_door/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `select_door/1` is always called with a valid door number).
- Recursion in `member/2` is well-behaved for finite lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:**  
The ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem is correct and aligns with theoretical expectations. No errors or edge cases were identified. The code is concise and leverages ProbLog's probabilistic features effectively. For future work, consider extending the problem to more doors or integrating DeepProbLog for hybrid reasoning.
