### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the merge sort implementation.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and logical constraints.
- Identify potential edge cases and performance issues.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`
- **Result**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The query successfully sorted the input list, and the probability result of `1.0000` confirms deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. The implementation correctly adheres to the merge sort algorithm's logic and ProbLog's requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates correctly as the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are properly defined.
- **Recursive Termination**: The `length/2` predicate ensures the recursion splits the list into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: No probabilistic facts are used in this implementation, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Features**: The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The merge sort algorithm is correctly implemented and deterministic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.
- **Single-element List**: Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([X], [X])`.
- **Performance**: The recursive splitting and merging could lead to performance issues for very large lists due to stack usage.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation for list type. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog features not used | N/A | Consider extending for probabilistic use cases if needed. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The merge sort implementation is correct and adheres to classical Prolog logic. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. Future improvements could include input validation and exploring probabilistic extensions.
