### **Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Zebra Puzzle Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation against the provided test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test result provided is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**. The output matches the expected solution for the Zebra Puzzle, satisfying all constraints:
  - The owner of the red house is English.
  - The Spanish person has a dog.
  - The green house owner drinks coffee.
  - The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
  - The zebra is owned by the Japanese person.
  - Water is drunk by the Norwegian.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the test result aligns with the expected solution.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code adheres to the puzzle's constraints, using predicates like `my_member`, `right_of`, and `next_to` to enforce relationships between houses.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) terminate correctly as they decompose the list until the base case is reached.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is involved.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) is used. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly solves the puzzle using deterministic logic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.
- **Non-list Input**: The input is explicitly structured as a list of houses, so non-list inputs are not a concern.
- **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited to the number of houses (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Conclusion**
The ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle is correct and passes all tests. The code adheres to classical Prolog semantics and does not require probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. No edge cases or failures were identified. The solution is robust and meets all functional requirements.
