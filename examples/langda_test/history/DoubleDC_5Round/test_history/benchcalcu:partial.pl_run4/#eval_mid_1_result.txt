#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Code in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition problem where `AB + BCD = CDE` using ProbLog. The goal is to ensure the code adheres to logical correctness, probabilistic rules (if applicable), and functional requirements. The evaluation focuses on:
- Verifying test results.
- Identifying failures (if any).
- Analyzing root causes.
- Ensuring edge cases are handled.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided are as follows:
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). Each query returns a probability of `1.0000`, indicating the solutions are valid and unique.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The code correctly:
- Defines digits and ensures the first digit is non-zero.
- Computes column-wise addition with carry.
- Ensures all digits are distinct.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates (`leftdigit`, `sumdigit`, `all_different`) are logically sound. Recursion in `all_different` terminates correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases like:
  - Non-zero first digits (`leftdigit`).
  - Unique digits (`all_different`).
  - Carry propagation (`sumdigit`).

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | The code solves the cryptoaddition problem logically.                       |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts/rules are used.                                      |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Inputs**: The code assumes valid digit inputs (0-9). Non-digit inputs are not handled.
- **Performance**: Recursion in `all_different` is efficient for small lists but may slow down for larger lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code is well-structured and meets the cryptoaddition requirements. No failures were found, and edge cases are handled appropriately. For future enhancements:
- Add input validation for non-digit inputs.
- Consider probabilistic extensions if needed.
