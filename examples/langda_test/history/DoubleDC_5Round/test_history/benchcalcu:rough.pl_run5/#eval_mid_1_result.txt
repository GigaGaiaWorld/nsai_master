### **Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle `AB + BCD = CDE`, where each letter represents a unique digit (0-9). The goal is to ensure the code correctly identifies valid solutions while adhering to constraints (e.g., no leading zeros, unique digits). This report evaluates the code's correctness, test results, and compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and deterministic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results show the following solutions with a probability of `1.0000`:
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The code successfully generates valid solutions for the puzzle.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates (`leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) and the main rule (`query_sum/1`) are correctly implemented.  
- **Key Predicates**:
  - `leftdigit(D)`: Ensures no leading zeros (line 6).
  - `all_different/1`: Enforces uniqueness of digits (lines 8-11).
  - `sumdigit/5`: Simulates column-wise addition with carry (lines 13-16).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Correctness**:  
  - The recursive `all_different/1` terminates correctly for lists of finite length.
  - Arithmetic operations (`sumdigit/5`) are deterministic and comply with Prolog's `is/2` semantics.
- **ProbLog Compliance**:  
  - The code uses no probabilistic facts or rules, so no violations of `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)` occur.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/…` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly enforced.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs to `query_sum/1` would fail gracefully (no crash).
  - **Performance**: Recursion depth is minimal (max 5 digits), so no performance issues.
