### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap movement, with the goal of moving the flap from position 6 to 4. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze logical and probabilistic correctness.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` are as follows:

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000          |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030          |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110          |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127          |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114          |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, given the probabilistic rules for actuator selection and wind effects.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented:
- `flap_position/2` (Lines 1–5): Ensures the flap moves only to legal positions.
- `overrun_exception/1` (Lines 6–8): Correctly identifies illegal flap positions.
- `goal_reached/1` (Lines 9–11): Accurately checks if the goal position is achieved.
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (Lines 12–20): Computes the new position based on actuator strength and wind effects.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules are logically sound. For example:
  - `flap_position/2` ensures the flap moves only if the attempted position is legal.
  - Recursive termination is guaranteed by the base case (`flap_position(0,6)`).

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `use_actuator/2` and `wind_effect/2` comply with ProbLog's rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`).
- **Negation:** The use of `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` in `overrun_exception/1` correctly implements probabilistic negation.

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Rules for flap movement and exceptions are logically correct.               |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met     | Probabilities for actuators and wind effects are correctly computed.       |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                      |

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates:** The code does not use undefined predicates or unsupported control constructs (e.g., cuts or if-then-else).
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here, as inputs are numeric.
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.
