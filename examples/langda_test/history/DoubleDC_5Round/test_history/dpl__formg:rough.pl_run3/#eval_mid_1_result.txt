### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the requirements of interpretability and edge-case handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passes with the correct output and a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` function as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The implementation adheres to the standard merge sort algorithm:  
  1. **Splitting**: The `split/3` predicate divides the list into two halves.  
  2. **Recursive Sorting**: `merge_sort/2` recursively sorts the sublists.  
  3. **Merging**: The `merge/3` predicate combines the sorted sublists.  
- **Termination**:  
  The recursion terminates correctly for empty lists (`[]`) and single-element lists (`[X]`).  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, confirming deterministic behavior.  
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**: The code does not involve neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) or probabilistic fusion.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status       | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met          | The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in classical Prolog.          |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                  |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used  | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                      |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion may lead to stack overflow for very large lists (not tested here).  
- **Expand/2**: Not applicable in this context.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow risk  | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is correct for the tested case and meets classical Prolog requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. Enhancements could include input validation and performance optimizations for large datasets.
