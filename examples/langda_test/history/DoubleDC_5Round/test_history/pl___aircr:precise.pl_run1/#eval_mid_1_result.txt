### **Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under probabilistic actuator selection and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while avoiding overrun exceptions. This report evaluates the code's correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with expectations, showing decreasing likelihood of reaching the goal over time and minimal overrun exceptions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:  
- `goal_reached/1` and `overrun_exception/1` (lines 15–20).  
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (lines 21–27).  
- Probabilistic facts (`wind/1`, `wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`) are correctly grounded and evaluated.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures no redundant calculations.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles illegal flap positions (`legal_flap_position/1`) and avoids infinite recursion.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind/1` and `wind_effect/2` comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
- **Negation:** `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` correctly models overrun exceptions.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Recursive predicates and logical checks are correct.                        |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met      | Probabilities are correctly computed and grounded.                          |
| Neural Network Integration | N/A    | Not applicable.                                                             |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the code.  
- **Non-list Input:** All inputs are numeric or probabilistic facts.  
- **Deep Recursion:** Limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.
