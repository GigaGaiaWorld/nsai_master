  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. Several critical conditions in the 'carrying' predicate have been removed, such as checking the robot's position and the key's position during pickup. The 'at' predicate for the robot's position has also been simplified incorrectly. These changes lead to significantly different probabilities in the results, particularly for 'carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))' and the positions of the robot and key."
