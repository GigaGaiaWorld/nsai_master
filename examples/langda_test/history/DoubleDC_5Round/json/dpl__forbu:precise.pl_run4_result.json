  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the 'swap' predicate definition: the original uses negation ('\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)') for the swap case, while the generated code directly defines the conditions ('X > Y' for swap and 'X =< Y' for no_swap). This change in implementation does not affect the overall behavior or results."
