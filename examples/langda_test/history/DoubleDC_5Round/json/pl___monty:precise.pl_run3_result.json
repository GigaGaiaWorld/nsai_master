  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem with the same probabilistic rules and queries. The generated code slightly reformats the conditions in the 'open_door' predicates but maintains the same logical structure. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
