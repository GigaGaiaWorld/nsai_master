  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic and produces the same results as the original code. The main difference is in the implementation of the 'open_door' predicate, where the generated code uses a more concise approach with 'findall' and 'length' to identify available doors to open, while the original code uses explicit probabilistic rules. Both versions correctly calculate the probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors (1/3 and 2/3 respectively). The generated code is valid and maintains the same functionality as the original."
