  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference is in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where the generated code uses 'goal_reached(Prev)' instead of 'goal(Old)' to check if the previous position was the goal. Despite this change, the running results are identical, indicating that the modification does not affect the overall behavior of the program. Both codes produce the same probabilities for 'goal_reached' and 'overrun_exception' queries."
