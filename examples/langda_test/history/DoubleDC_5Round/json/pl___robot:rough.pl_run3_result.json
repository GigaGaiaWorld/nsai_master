  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet expectations. It has several issues: 1) The first carrying/2 rule is missing the do(pickup(key),T) condition, which is crucial for the logic. 2) The at/3 rules for robot movement are incorrectly formulated, particularly the first two rules which now have problematic conditions that lead to a non-ground query error. 3) The generated code fails to run due to a NonGroundQuery error, indicating fundamental problems in its formulation. The original code works correctly while the generated version is invalid."
