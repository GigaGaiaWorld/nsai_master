  "final_report": "The generated code extends the functionality of the original code by introducing a 'number' predicate that can convert a list of digit images into a multi-digit number, and then performs addition on these multi-digit numbers. This is a valid extension and demonstrates consistency with the original code's approach to digit recognition and arithmetic operations. The generated code is correct and meets the requirements, as it successfully calculates the sum of two multi-digit numbers represented by lists of digit images."
