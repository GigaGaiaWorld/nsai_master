  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. However, the generated code simplifies the logic by directly comparing elements X and Y without using the 'hole' and 'swap' predicates, making it more straightforward. The generated code is also valid and meets the requirements."
