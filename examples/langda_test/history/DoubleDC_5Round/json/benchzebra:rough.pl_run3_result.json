  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It successfully replicates the logic of the zebra puzzle, including all constraints and member checks. The only differences are in the implementation of helper predicates (my_member, next_to, right_of), which are logically equivalent but slightly reorganized in the generated code. The generated code maintains the same behavior and produces identical results to the original code."
