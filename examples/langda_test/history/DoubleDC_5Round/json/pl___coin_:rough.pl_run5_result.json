  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in both form and result. The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips over 4 trials with a success probability of 0.8. The generated code incorrectly hardcodes 'head' and 'tail' as outcomes, which alters the probabilistic nature of the original code. Additionally, the generated code's results are incorrect, showing inconsistent probabilities that do not match the binomial distribution expected from the original code."
