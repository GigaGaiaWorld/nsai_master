  "final_report": "The generated code has significant issues compared to the original code. While it maintains the same structure for detecting numbers and operators, the parsing logic for mathematical operations is incorrect. The generated code fails to properly handle operator precedence and grouping (particularly for subtraction and division), leading to a runtime error. The original code correctly processes the expression '2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7' to get -10.333..., while the generated code fails to execute due to incorrect argument handling in the almost_equal predicate."
