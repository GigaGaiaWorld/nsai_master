  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The main difference is the use of the built-in 'sort' predicate in the generated code instead of the custom 'insertion_sort' used in the original code. This change does not affect the functionality as both achieve the same result. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
