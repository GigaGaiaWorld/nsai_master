  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It maintains the same logic for determining the outcome of rock-paper-scissors games and calculating the final winner. The main difference is the renaming of the 'result' predicate to 'outcome' in the generated code, which does not affect the program's behavior. Both codes produce identical results when run with the same input."
