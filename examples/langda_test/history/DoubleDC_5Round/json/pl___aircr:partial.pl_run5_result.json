  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, with only minor formatting differences and a slight rearrangement of conditions in some predicates. The logic and behavior remain unchanged, as evidenced by the identical run results. The generated code correctly implements the aircraft flap controller model and produces the same probability distributions for goal_reached and overrun_exception queries."
