  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has some critical issues. The main problem is in the 'parse' predicate for addition, where it directly uses 'is' instead of 'almost_equal', which affects the precision and correctness of the result. Additionally, the generated code does not include the complete set of parse rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are necessary for full functionality. The running result of the generated code is incorrect, returning 0.0000 instead of the expected -10.333333333333332."
