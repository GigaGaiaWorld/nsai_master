  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference lies in the definition of the 'swap' predicate. The original code uses negation as failure (\\+) to define the swap condition, while the generated code directly uses 'X > Y' and 'X =< Y' for clarity. This change does not affect the correctness or the result of the program."
