  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and structure. Both codes correctly implement the detection of numbers and operators, parsing of expressions, and evaluation of arithmetic operations. The generated code maintains the same logic and produces the same result as the original code. However, there are minor formatting inconsistencies, such as line breaks and indentation, which do not affect the functionality. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
