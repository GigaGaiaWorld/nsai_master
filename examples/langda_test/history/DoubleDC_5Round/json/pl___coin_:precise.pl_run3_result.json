  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it results in a timeout error during execution, indicating potential issues with recursion or logic flow. The structure differs from the original code by separating the coin check and recursive call into distinct clauses without proper conjunction, which likely causes the infinite loop or excessive computation. The original code properly handles the recursive counting of coin flips with a clear conditional structure."
