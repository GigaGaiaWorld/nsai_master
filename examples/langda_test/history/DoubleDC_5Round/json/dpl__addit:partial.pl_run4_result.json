  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes define the same digit facts and the addition predicate, which correctly sums the digits associated with the images. The generated code uses different variable names (A and B) instead of X2 and Y2, but this does not affect the logic or the result. The query and the result are identical in both cases."
