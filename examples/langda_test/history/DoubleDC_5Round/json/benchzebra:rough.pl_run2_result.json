  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It successfully replicates the logic of the original zebra puzzle solution, including all constraints and member checks. The only differences are in the formatting and the definition of 'next_to', which is now based on 'right_of' but maintains the same logical behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
