  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it uses 'member/2' instead of 'my_member/2', which causes an error since 'member/2' is not defined. Second, the order of attributes in some house predicates is incorrect, such as 'house(_, _, _, winstons, snail)' where 'snail' should be in the third position. These inconsistencies make the generated code invalid and prevent it from producing the same result as the original code."
