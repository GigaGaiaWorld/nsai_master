  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same functionality for detecting numbers and operators, parsing expressions, and performing calculations. However, there is a minor formatting issue in the 'detect_all' predicate where the line breaks and indentation are inconsistent. Despite this, the logic remains intact and the code produces the same result as the original."
