  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes solve the same cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with identical constraints and produce the same results. However, the generated code has minor formatting issues (unnecessary line breaks and spaces) and reorders some predicates in the query_sum rule, which does not affect the logic but makes it slightly less readable. The all_different check is placed earlier in the generated code, which is a valid optimization."
