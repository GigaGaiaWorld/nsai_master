The code attempts to modify the original logic but introduces errors that prevent it from running. The original code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem with proper probability distributions and queries, yielding expected results (win_keep=0.3333, win_switch=0.6667). The generated code fails to maintain consistency with the original logic and structure, resulting in an invalid Problog program."
