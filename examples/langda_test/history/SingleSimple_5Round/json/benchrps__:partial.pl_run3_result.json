  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the `compute_score` clause for `draw`. The original code correctly updates the score with `S is S1`, while the generated code mistakenly uses `compute_score(Rs, S)` which would not properly propagate the score. However, this error does not affect the final result in this specific test case, as the score calculation still yields the correct winner."
