  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes (win_keep and win_switch). The main difference lies in the formulation of the open_door rules, which have been slightly restructured but still achieve the same logical conditions. The generated code is valid and produces results consistent with the original code."
