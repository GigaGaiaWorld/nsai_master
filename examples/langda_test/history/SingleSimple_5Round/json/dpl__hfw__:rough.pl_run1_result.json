  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect compared to the original code. It only handles the addition operation and lacks implementations for subtraction, multiplication, and division. This results in the query failing to compute the correct result, as evidenced by the run result showing a probability of 0.0000. The original code correctly computes the expression and returns a valid result."
