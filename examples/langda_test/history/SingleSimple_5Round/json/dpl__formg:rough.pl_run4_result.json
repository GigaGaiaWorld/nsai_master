  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm, similar to the original code. The main difference lies in the 'split' function, which in the generated code splits the list by alternating elements, whereas the original code splits the list into two halves based on length. Despite this difference, both implementations produce the correct sorted result. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, and its running result is consistent with the original code."
