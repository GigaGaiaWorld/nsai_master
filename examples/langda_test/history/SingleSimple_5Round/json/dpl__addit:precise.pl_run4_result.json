  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of image references into multi-digit numbers and then performs addition. This is a valid extension of the original code's concept. The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements of performing arithmetic operations on digit representations. The result (79 + 312 = 391) is correct and demonstrates the extended functionality working as intended."
