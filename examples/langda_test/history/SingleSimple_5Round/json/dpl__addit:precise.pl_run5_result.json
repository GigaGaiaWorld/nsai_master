  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle lists of digits and form multi-digit numbers, then performs addition on these numbers. This is a valid extension and demonstrates correct Prolog syntax and logic. The original code only handled single-digit addition, while the generated code correctly handles multi-digit addition. The results are consistent with the expected behavior in both cases - the original correctly adds 5+6 to get 11, and the generated code correctly forms 79 and 312 then adds them to get 391."
