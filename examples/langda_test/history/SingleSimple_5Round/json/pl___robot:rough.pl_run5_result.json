  "final_report": "The generated code has significant differences from the original code, particularly in the 'carrying' predicate definitions. The original code includes conditions for the robot's position and key's position during pickup, while the generated code simplifies this. The generated code also incorrectly replaces the complex conditions for retaining the key with a simple 'retains_key(T)' condition. These changes affect the probability calculations, leading to different results. The generated code is syntactically valid but semantically inconsistent with the original logic."
