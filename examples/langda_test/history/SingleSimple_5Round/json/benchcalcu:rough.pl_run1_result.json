  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. However, there are formatting issues and redundant repetitions of the digit and predicate definitions within the query_sum predicate, which do not affect the logic but make the code less clean. The generated code produces the same results as the original code, including the correct solutions to the cryptarithmetic problem, but also includes an additional ambiguous result 'query_sum([X6, X7, X8, X9, X10])' which is not present in the original output."
