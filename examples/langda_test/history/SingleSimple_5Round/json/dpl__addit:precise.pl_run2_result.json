  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts lists of image references into their corresponding numerical values. This allows for multi-digit addition, which is a logical extension of the original single-digit addition. The code is correctly implemented and produces the expected result (79 + 312 = 391). The form is valid as it maintains the original digit definitions while adding new capabilities, and the result is consistent with the extended functionality."
