  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the constraints and logic of the original zebra puzzle solution. The only difference is the reordering of predicate definitions and the simplification of the 'next_to' predicate, which now directly uses 'right_of' for both directions. This change does not affect the functionality or the result. Both codes produce identical output, solving the puzzle correctly."
