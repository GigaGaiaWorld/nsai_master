  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of functionality but has some formatting issues and redundant repetitions of predicates. The logic for cryptoaddition remains correct, and the results produced are identical to the original code, including the same solutions for the query_sum predicate. However, the generated code unnecessarily repeats the digit definitions and other predicates within the query_sum definition, which is syntactically incorrect and could lead to confusion. Despite this, the execution results are valid and match the original output."
