  "final_report": "The generated code has significant differences from the original code, particularly in the definition of 'carrying(key,s(T))'. The original code includes conditions like 'at(robot,Pos,T)' and 'at(key,Pos,T)' which are missing in the generated code. Additionally, the generated code simplifies the second clause of 'carrying(key,s(T))' to just 'retains_key(T)', omitting several conditions present in the original. These changes affect the probability calculations, leading to different results. The generated code is syntactically valid but semantically inconsistent with the original."
