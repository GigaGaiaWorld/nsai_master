  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code, but there is a minor discrepancy in the predicate 'my_member(house(_, _, snail, _, winstons), Houses)' where 'snail' should be 'snails' as in the original code. This does not affect the overall logic but is a slight inconsistency. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output."
