  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally identical to the original code. Both implement the insertion sort algorithm correctly, with the same logic for sorting and inserting elements. The only difference is the formatting and variable naming (TSorted vs SortedTail), which does not affect the functionality. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same sorted list with a probability of 1.0000."
