  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has some modifications in the rules for 'carrying' and 'at' predicates. The main issue is in the 'carrying' predicate where the generated code omits some conditions present in the original code, such as checking the robot's position and key's position during pickup. This leads to different probabilities in the results. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results due to these omissions."
