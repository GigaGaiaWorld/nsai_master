  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor discrepancy: 'snails' in the original code is written as 'snail' in the generated code. This does not affect the overall logic or the solution to the zebra puzzle. The generated code maintains all the constraints and relationships specified in the original code, and the running results are effectively identical, differing only in the pluralization of 'snail'."
