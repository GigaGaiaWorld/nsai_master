  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort but has several issues. First, the `swap` predicate only swaps adjacent elements if X > Y, which is correct, but the `bubblesort` predicate does not properly accumulate the sorted elements. The base case for a single element incorrectly uses `append`, which is unnecessary. The original code correctly accumulates sorted elements in reverse order and handles swaps more comprehensively. The generated code fails to produce a sorted list, as evidenced by the run result showing 0.0000 probability for any output."
