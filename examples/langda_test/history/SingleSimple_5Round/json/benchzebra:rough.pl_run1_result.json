  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It successfully replicates the constraints and queries of the original zebra puzzle. The only minor difference is the reordering of predicate definitions and the simplification of the 'next_to' predicate, which now directly uses 'right_of' instead of having separate clauses. This change does not affect the outcome and is a valid optimization."
