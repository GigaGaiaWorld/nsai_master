  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm, similar to the original code. It uses a different approach for splitting the list, which is more concise and efficient. The merge and merge_sort predicates are functionally equivalent to the original. The generated code is valid and produces the same correct sorted output as the original code. No issues were found in the generated code."
