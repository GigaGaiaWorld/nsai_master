  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code. It maintains all the core logic, including the flap position control, actuator selection, wind effect modeling, and exception handling. The only differences are minor formatting changes (line breaks and spacing) which do not affect the program's behavior. The generated code correctly preserves all probabilistic rules and queries, producing identical results to the original code."
