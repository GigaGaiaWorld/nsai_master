  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It includes all the necessary predicates and rules from the original code, such as member/2, prove/1, and the extended logic processing predicates (implies, opposite, expand, includes, extend, refute). The examples and queries are also correctly replicated. The only minor differences are in formatting and whitespace, which do not affect the code's functionality or results."
