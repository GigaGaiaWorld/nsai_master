  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally similar to the original code but lacks the definitions for basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) which are crucial for the queries to return valid results. This omission causes the generated code to fail in producing the expected outputs, as evidenced by the run results showing 0.0000 probabilities for all queries. The original code includes these operations and successfully executes them, yielding correct and expected results."
