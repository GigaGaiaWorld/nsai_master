It only handles the addition operation and lacks implementations for subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are present in the original code. The generated code also fails to correctly parse and evaluate the expression, resulting in an incorrect run result (0.0000) compared to the original code's correct result (-10.333333333333332). The generated code does not meet the requirements and is not consistent with the original code."
