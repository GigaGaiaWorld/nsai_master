  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for 'draw' cases. The original code correctly updates the score by keeping it unchanged (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes Rs directly without updating S. However, this does not affect the final result in this specific query because the score calculation still leads to the same conclusion (player2 wins)."
