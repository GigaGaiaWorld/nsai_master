  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, particularly changing how subtraction and division are handled. Unlike the original code, which uses a different approach for subtraction (converting it to addition with a negative multiplier), the generated code directly parses subtraction and other operations. This change leads to a runtime error because the 'almost_equal' predicate is called with ungrounded variables, violating its expected ground conditions. The original code successfully computes the expression, while the generated code fails due to this error."
