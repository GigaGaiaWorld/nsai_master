  "final_report": "The generated code introduces several issues compared to the original code. First, it incorrectly uses 'snail' instead of 'snails' in the my_member predicate, which is a typographical error. Second, it replaces the Houses list pattern matching for the milk condition with nth1/3, a predicate that is not defined in the code, leading to a runtime error. The rest of the code maintains the original logic but these changes make it invalid. The original code runs successfully and produces the correct result, while the generated code fails due to the undefined nth1/3 predicate."
