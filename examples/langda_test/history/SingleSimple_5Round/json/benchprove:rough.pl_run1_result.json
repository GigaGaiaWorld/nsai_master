  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. However, it contains redundant definitions of `prove(true)`, `prove(Goal)`, and `prove((A,B))`, which are already defined in the original code. The `implies` predicate in the generated code is incorrectly implemented as it requires both `A` and `B` to be provable, whereas the original code correctly implements it as `A ⇒ B` (either `A` is unprovable or `B` is provable). Despite this, the running results are consistent with the original code for the given queries."
