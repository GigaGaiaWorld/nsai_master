  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image identifiers into a numerical value. This allows for multi-digit addition, which is a significant enhancement over the original single-digit addition. The code is consistent with the original in terms of using image identifiers and digit mappings. The result of the multi_addition query correctly computes the sum of 79 and 312 as 391, demonstrating that the generated code works as intended."
