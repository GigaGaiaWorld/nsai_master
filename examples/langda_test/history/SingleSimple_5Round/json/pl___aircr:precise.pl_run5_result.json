  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code. The only change is in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where the condition '\\+ goal(Old)' has been replaced with '\\+ goal_reached(Prev)'. This change does not affect the logic or the results, as both conditions ensure that the flap continues to move only if the goal has not been reached. The running results are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expectations and is consistent with the original code."
