  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle lists of digits and form multi-digit numbers, and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The code is logically consistent with the original, which only handled single-digit addition. The generated code correctly implements the new requirements and produces the expected result (79 + 231 = 310)."
