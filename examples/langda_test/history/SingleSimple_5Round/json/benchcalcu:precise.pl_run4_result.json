  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. However, there are formatting issues and redundant repetitions of the digit and predicate definitions within the query_sum predicate, which do not affect the correctness but make the code less clean. The generated code correctly implements the cryptarithmetic puzzle solver and produces the same results as the original code, including the additional solution with variables [X6, X7, X8, X9, X10] which appears to be a placeholder or an artifact of the generation process."
