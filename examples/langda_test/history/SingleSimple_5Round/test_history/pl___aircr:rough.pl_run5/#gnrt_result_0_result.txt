Based on the requirements, I'll generate the code for calculating the attempted flap position based on previous position, actuator used, target position, and wind effect. Here's the completed code in JSON form:

```problog
{"HASH": "A5C06F43","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),\n \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n use_actuator(Time,Actuator),\n actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),\n goal(Target),\n wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),\n Pos is PrevPos + sign(Target-PrevPos)*Strength + WindEffect."}
```
