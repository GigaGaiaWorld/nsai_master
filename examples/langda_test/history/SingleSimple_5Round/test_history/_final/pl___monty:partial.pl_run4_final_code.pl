The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining consistency with the original code's functionality. Both codes produce identical results, with win_keep at 0.3333 and win_switch at 0.6667, which aligns with the expected probabilities. The generated code simplifies some conditions but does not alter the core logic or outcomes. No significant problems are detected in the generated code.
