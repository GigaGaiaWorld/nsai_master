The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It accurately models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for prize placement, door selection, and outcomes (win_keep and win_switch). The modifications in the generated code, such as the explicit use of 'Selected' in the open_door rules, do not affect the logic or results. Both codes produce identical results, confirming their equivalence.
