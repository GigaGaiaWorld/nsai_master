Here's the completed code in the requested JSON format:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFA63C1E","Code": "move(rock). move(paper). move(scissor). beats(rock, scissor). beats(scissor, paper). beats(paper, rock)."}
```

For the other parts of the code that weren't specifically requested in the <langda> block, I'm not including them since they weren't part of the requirements. The response only includes the game rules portion that was specifically requested with the hash CFA63C1E.
