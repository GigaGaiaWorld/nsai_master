Based on the requirements, I'll generate the code for calculating the attempted flap position based on previous position, actuator used, and wind effect. Here's the JSON-formatted Problog code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A5C06F43","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),\n goal(G),\n PrevPos \\= G,\n use_actuator(Time,Actuator),\n actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),\n wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),\n Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect."}
```

This code completes the `attempted_flap_position` predicate by:
1. Taking the previous position
2. Checking if goal hasn't been reached yet
3. Getting the actuator being used and its strength
4. Incorporating the wind effect
5. Calculating the new attempted position as previous position minus actuator strength plus wind effect (since we're moving from 6 to 4)
