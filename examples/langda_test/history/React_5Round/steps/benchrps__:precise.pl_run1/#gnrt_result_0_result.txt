```

Note: While the syntax notes mention that if-then-else (->) isn't supported in standard ProbLog, many implementations do support it. If you encounter issues, you could alternatively use:
```problog
{"HASH": "4E6CE90A","Code": "play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\ncompute_score(Results, Score),\n(Score > 0, Winner = player1 ;\n Score < 0, Winner = player2 ;\n Score =:= 0, Winner = draw)."}
```
