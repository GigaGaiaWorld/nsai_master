{"HASH": "ECE2B24A","Code": "bb(N) :- Max is N-1, between(1, Max, I), pick(I, b), pick(I+1, b)."}
```

### Explanation:
- `Max is N-1` calculates the maximum starting position for adjacent pairs.
- `between(1, Max, I)` generates values of `I` from `1` to `Max`.
- `pick(I, b), pick(I+1, b)` checks if both positions `I` and `I+1` have the character `b`.
- If any such pair exists, `bb(N)` succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. 

This implementation aligns with the requirements provided in the `<Langda>` block.
