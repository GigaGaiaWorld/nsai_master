### Explanation:
1. **First Block (E2FA63E7)**:
   - The rule checks for two unselected doors (`A` and `B`, where `A < B` to avoid duplicates) that do not contain the prize (`\+ prize(A), \+ prize(B)`).
   - The host then randomly opens one of them (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).

2. **Second Block (B4161B21)**:
   - The rule checks for the only unselected door (`A`) that does not contain the prize (`\+ prize(A)`).
   - The other unselected door (`P`) must contain the prize (`prize(P)`).
   - The host opens the empty door (`A`) with certainty (`open_door(A)`).
