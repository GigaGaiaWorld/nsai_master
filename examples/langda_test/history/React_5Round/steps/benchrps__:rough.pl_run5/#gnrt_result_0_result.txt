This version:
1. Uses disjunction (;) instead of if-then
2. Uses negation-as-failure (\+) to check for draw conditions
3. Maintains the same recursive structure
4. Properly handles all three possible outcomes (win, lose, draw) for each move pair
5. Is compatible with ProbLog's supported control predicates
