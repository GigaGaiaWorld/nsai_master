```

This implementation:
1. Calculates `Max` as `N-1`
2. Uses `between/3` to enumerate positions from 1 to Max
3. For each position `I`, checks if both `I` and `I+1` were picked as `'b'`
4. Succeeds if any such pair is found (due to Prolog's backtracking behavior)

The predicate will be true if there exists at least one adjacent pair of `'b'` characters in the string of length `N`.
