```

The implementation:
1. Calculates Max as N-1 (since we're checking pairs, the last possible starting position is N-1)
2. Uses between/3 to enumerate all positions I from 1 to Max (confirmed to be available in ProbLog)
3. For each I, checks that both position I and I+1 have 'b' (using pick/2)
4. Succeeds if any such pair is found (implicit OR through multiple solutions)

This matches exactly with the requirements specified in the <Langda> block.
