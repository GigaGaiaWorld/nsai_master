{"HASH": "06576BEB","Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :- digit(H, D), number(T, NT), N is NT * 10 + D."}
```

This implementation:
1. Handles the base case of an empty list returning 0
2. For non-empty lists, recursively processes each digit and combines them into a single number
3. Works with the existing digit/2 facts and multi_addition/3 predicate
