### Explanation:
1. The first clause handles the case where `coin(CNT)` is true (heads). It increments `SC` by 1, decrements `CNT` by 1, and recurses.
2. The second clause handles the case where `coin(CNT)` is false (tails). It leaves `SC` unchanged, decrements `CNT` by 1, and recurses.
3. The recursion continues until `CNT = 0`, at which point the base case returns the accumulated `SC` as `S`.

This satisfies the requirements of accumulating the count of successful coin flips over 4 trials (as specified in `total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).`).
