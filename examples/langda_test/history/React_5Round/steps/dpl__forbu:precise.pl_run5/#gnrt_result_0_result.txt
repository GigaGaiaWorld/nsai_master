```
```problog
{"HASH": "5CBF7C6A","Code": "swap(X,Y,swap) :- X > Y.\nswap(X,Y,no_swap) :- X =< Y."}
```

These code segments:
1. Complete the bubblesort predicate by recursively processing the list and building the sorted result
2. Define the swap predicate that determines when two elements should be swapped based on their values (X > Y triggers a swap)
