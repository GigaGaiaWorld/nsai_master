{"HASH": "06576BEB","Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :- digit(H, D), number(T, N1), N is N1 * 10 + D."}
```

This code defines:
1. A base case where an empty list returns 0
2. A recursive case that:
   - Gets the digit for the head of the list
   - Processes the tail recursively
   - Combines them by multiplying the accumulated number by 10 and adding the new digit

This will correctly convert lists like `[img_7, img_9]` to 79 and `[img_3, img_1, img_2]` to 312.
