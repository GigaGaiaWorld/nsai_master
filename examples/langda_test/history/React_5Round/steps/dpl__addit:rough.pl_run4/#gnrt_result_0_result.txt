{"HASH": "06576BEB","Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([Img|Imgs], N) :- digit(Img, D), number(Imgs, N1), N is N1 * 10 + D."}
```

This code defines:
1. A base case where an empty list results in 0
2. A recursive case that:
   - Gets the digit for the first image
   - Recursively processes the rest of the list
   - Combines them by multiplying the accumulated number by 10 and adding the new digit

This will correctly convert lists like [img_7, img_9] to 79 and [img_3, img_1, img_2] to 312.
