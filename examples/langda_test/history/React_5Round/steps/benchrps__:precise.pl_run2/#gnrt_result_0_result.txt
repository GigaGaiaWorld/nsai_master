{"HASH": "FB0E8901","Code": "compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "4E6CE90A","Code": "play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\ncompute_score(Results, Score),\n(Score > 0, Winner = player1;\n Score < 0, Winner = player2;\n Score =:= 0, Winner = tie)."}
```

Note that:
1. The draw case (133D6BEE) was already correctly implemented in the visible code
2. For the determine_winner predicate (4E6CE90A), I've used the disjunction approach with conditions separated by commas since ProbLog doesn't support if-then-else
3. The lose case (FB0E8901) simply subtracts 1 from the score as required
