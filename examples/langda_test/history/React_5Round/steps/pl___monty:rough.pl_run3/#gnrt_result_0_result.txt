```

This implementation:
1. Uses `findall` to collect all possible doors Monty can open (not selected and not containing prize)
2. For two possible doors ([A,B]), creates probabilistic choices with 50% probability each
3. For one possible door ([A]), creates a deterministic opening
4. Fails in other cases (though this shouldn't happen in the Monty Hall problem)
5. Follows ProbLog syntax by using `::` for probabilistic facts and standard Prolog syntax for deterministic parts
