{"HASH": "06576BEB","Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([Img|Imgs], N) :-\n    digit(Img, D),\n    number(Imgs, N1),\n    N is N1 * 10 + D."}
```

This code defines:
1. Base case: an empty list results in 0
2. Recursive case: for a list `[Img|Imgs]`, we:
   - Get the digit D for Img
   - Recursively process the rest of the list to get N1
   - Combine them as N1*10 + D to form the complete number

The predicate will correctly convert lists like `[img_7, img_9]` to 79 and `[img_3, img_1, img_2]` to 312, allowing the `multi_addition` query to work as intended.
