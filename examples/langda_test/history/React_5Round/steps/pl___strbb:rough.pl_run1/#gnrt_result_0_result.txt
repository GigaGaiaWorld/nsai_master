{"HASH": "0805B4F6","Code": "bb(N) :- between(1, N-1, I), pick(I, b), pick(I+1, b)."}
```

This code defines `bb(N)` to succeed if there exists an `I` between 1 and `N-1` such that both `I` and `I+1` pick the character `b`. The `between/3` predicate is used to generate valid indices, and the two `pick/2` calls check the consecutive characters.
