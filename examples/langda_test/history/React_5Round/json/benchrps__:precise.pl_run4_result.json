  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It accurately implements the rock-paper-scissors game rules, calculates the results of each round, and determines the winner based on the computed score. The only minor difference is the use of '=:=' instead of '=' in the Score comparison, which is syntactically correct in Prolog and does not affect the outcome. Both codes produce the same result for the given query."
