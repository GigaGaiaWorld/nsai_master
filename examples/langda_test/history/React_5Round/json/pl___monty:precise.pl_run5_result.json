  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes (win_keep and win_switch). The main difference is the restructuring of the conditions in the open_door rules, but this does not affect the logic or results. The generated code is valid and produces the same results as the original code."
