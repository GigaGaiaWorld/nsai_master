  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it introduces a syntax error in the 'between/3' predicate call, where 'N-1' is not evaluated before being passed as an argument, leading to a runtime error. The original code correctly evaluates 'Max is N-1' before using it in 'between/3'. This error makes the generated code invalid."
