  "final_report": "The generated code introduces a new predicate 'coin_toss' which is not present in the original code and causes a syntax error due to operator priority clash. The original code uses a simple probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips, while the generated code attempts to use a different logic with 'coin_toss' but fails to execute properly. The generated code is not valid and does not produce consistent results with the original code."
