  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes (win_keep and win_switch). The main difference is in the formulation of the open_door rules, where the generated code adds a redundant select_door(D) condition and slightly restructures the conditions. However, these changes do not affect the overall logic or results. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their consistency."
