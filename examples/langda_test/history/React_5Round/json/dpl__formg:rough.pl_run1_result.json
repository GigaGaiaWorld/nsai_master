  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm in Prolog, with the same base cases and recursive logic. The generated code uses a different approach for splitting the list, which is more concise and efficient, splitting the list into two halves directly without calculating lengths. The merge logic remains the same in both codes. The running results are identical, producing the correct sorted list."
