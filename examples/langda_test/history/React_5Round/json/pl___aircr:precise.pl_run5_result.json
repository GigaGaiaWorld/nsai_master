  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The key change is in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where the condition '\\+ goal(Old)' is replaced with '\\+ goal_reached(Prev)'. This modification does not affect the overall behavior because both conditions ensure that the flap continues to move only if the goal has not been reached. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected requirements."
