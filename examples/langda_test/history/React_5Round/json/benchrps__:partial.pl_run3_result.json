  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there are minor formatting issues such as unnecessary line breaks and periods after some predicates. The logic of the game rules and result calculation remains intact. One notable error is in the 'compute_score' predicate for 'draw' cases, where 'S is S1' is incorrectly written as 'compute_score(Rs, S)', which would cause infinite recursion. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same output for the given query."
