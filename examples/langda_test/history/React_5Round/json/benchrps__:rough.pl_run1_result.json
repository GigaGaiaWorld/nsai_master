  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct in form and follows the same logic as the original code. However, there is a critical issue in the 'play' predicate where the conditions for win, lose, and draw are not properly constrained, leading to multiple possible results for the same input. This causes the query to return all possible outcomes (player1, player2, draw) with equal probability, which is incorrect. The original code correctly computes a single deterministic result."
