  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it uses 'member/2' instead of 'my_member/2', which leads to an error since 'member/2' is not defined. Second, it incorrectly uses 'snail' instead of 'snails' in one of the member predicates. Additionally, the generated code includes optional clauses for zebra and water with ';true', which deviates from the original code's strict requirements. These issues make the generated code invalid and inconsistent with the original code."
