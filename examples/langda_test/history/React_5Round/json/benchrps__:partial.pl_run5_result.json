  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. However, there is a minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for the 'draw' case. The original code correctly computes the score by maintaining the accumulated score (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes S1 directly without assignment (S = S1), which could lead to incorrect score accumulation in some Prolog implementations. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent for the given query, producing the same output."
