  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it uses 'member/2' instead of 'my_member/2', which causes an error since 'member/2' is not defined. Second, the order of some predicates in the house structures is incorrect, such as 'dog' and 'snail' being misplaced. Additionally, the generated code includes optional clauses for 'zebra' and 'water' with '; true', which deviates from the original code's strict requirements. These inconsistencies make the generated code invalid and its results inconsistent with the original code."
