  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. The main issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause error, which occurs because the variable 'C' in 'coin(C)' is not properly instantiated before being used in a probabilistic context. This makes the generated code invalid. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic choice by using 'coin(CNT)' in a way that ensures the variable is properly instantiated. The generated code also fails to maintain the same logic for counting successful coin flips as the original code, which uses a clear if-then-else structure."
