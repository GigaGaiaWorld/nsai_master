  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, the order of attributes in the house predicate is inconsistent with the original code, leading to incorrect assignments (e.g., 'dog' is placed in the wrong position). Second, some constraints are incorrectly implemented, such as the snail owner smoking Winstons and the Chesterfields owner living next to the fox owner. These errors cause the generated code to produce a different result than the original code. Despite these issues, the generated code is syntactically valid and runs without errors."
