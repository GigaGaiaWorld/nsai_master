/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause 'coin(C)' which causes an error during evaluation. The original code uses a ground probabilistic fact 'coin(CNT)' within the recursive clause, ensuring proper grounding. The generated code attempts to use a non-ground variable 'C' in the probabilistic clause, which is not allowed in Problog. This leads to a runtime error. The generated code also incorrectly structures the conditional logic, further deviating from the original's behavior.
