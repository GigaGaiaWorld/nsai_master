0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-
 
 between(1, N-1, I), pick(I, b), pick(I+1, b).
len(5).
evidence(palindrome(X)) :- len(X).
query(bb(X)) :- len(X).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error in the 'between/3' predicate call. The original code correctly calculates 'Max is N-1' before calling 'between', while the generated code attempts to use 'N-1' directly in the 'between' call, which is not syntactically correct in Problog. This causes a CallModeError. The logic of the two codes is otherwise consistent, but the generated code fails to execute properly.
