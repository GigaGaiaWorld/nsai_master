% Prove "true" always succeeds

% --------- Examples ---------- %
% Define some expand rules:
expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.
expand(square(X), Y) :- Y is X*X.
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, carol).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y).
% --------- Queries ---------- %
query(prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))).
query(prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))).
query(prove(expand(double(3),6))).
query(prove(includes([a,b,c],b))).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the functionality of the original code but introduces several issues. The main problem is in the 'expand' predicate, which is incorrectly defined and causes an error during execution. The original code uses 'expand' as a fact/rule to be proven, while the generated code incorrectly treats it as a predicate with a clause/2 call, leading to an AttributeError. Additionally, the 'implies' predicate in the generated code uses a different implementation (-> operator) which changes its logical meaning. The other predicates (opposite, includes, extend, refute) are correctly replicated but the overall validity is compromised by the expand and implies issues.
