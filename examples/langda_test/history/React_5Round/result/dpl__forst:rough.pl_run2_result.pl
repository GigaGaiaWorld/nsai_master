/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is incomplete as it misses several stack operations (pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that were present in the original code. This results in incorrect or missing outputs for those operations. The only operation that works correctly is 'push'. The generated code is not consistent with the original code and fails to meet the expected functionality.
