/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause by using 'coin(C)' without binding 'C' to a specific value, which leads to an error during execution. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic coin flips by using 'coin(CNT)' within a disjunction, ensuring proper grounding. The generated code fails to replicate this behavior and results in a runtime error.
