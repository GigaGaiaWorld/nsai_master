/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but contains a syntax error in the 'open_door' predicate, specifically an operator priority clash. This makes the code invalid and unexecutable. The original code correctly implements the problem with proper probabilistic rules for opening doors and calculates the winning probabilities for both keeping and switching choices. The generated code fails to achieve this due to its syntax error.
