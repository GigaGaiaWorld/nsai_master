/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but contains a syntax error in the 'open_door' rule, specifically an operator priority clash. This makes the code invalid and unexecutable. The original code correctly implements the problem with proper probability distributions and conditions, yielding expected results (win_keep=0.3333, win_switch=0.6667). The generated code fails to run due to parsing errors, thus not producing any results.
