/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. It fails to handle the case where the coin flip is unsuccessful, which was present in the original code. The original code uses a disjunction to account for both successful and unsuccessful coin flips, while the generated code only considers the successful case. Additionally, the generated code contains a syntax error in the 'is/2' predicate, which expects ground terms but receives uninstantiated variables. This leads to a runtime error.
