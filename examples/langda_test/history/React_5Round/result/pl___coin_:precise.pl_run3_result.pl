/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error. The issue occurs at line 7 where there's a misplaced period and incomplete structure in the disjunction. The original code correctly implements a recursive probability calculation for coin flips, while the generated version fails to parse due to improper syntax. The generated code doesn't maintain the same logic as the original, particularly in handling both success and failure cases of coin flips.
