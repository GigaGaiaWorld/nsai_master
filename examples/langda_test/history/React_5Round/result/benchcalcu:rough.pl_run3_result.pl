/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It correctly defines the digits, ensures the first digits are non-zero, and checks for all digits being different. The main predicate 'query_sum' is also correctly implemented with the same logic for digit addition and carry propagation. However, the generated code has a minor formatting issue with the digit definitions being split across lines unnecessarily, which does not affect functionality. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code meets the expected requirements.
