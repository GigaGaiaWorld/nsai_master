***Report:***
Validity_form:True\Validity_result:False
The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but introduces a subtle change in the 'bb' predicate. Instead of using 'II is I+1, pick(II,b)', it directly uses 'pick(I+1, b)'. This change alters the logic slightly, leading to a different probability calculation for 'bb(5)'. The original code's result was 0.3750, while the generated code's result is 0.6484, indicating a significant discrepancy. The generated code is syntactically valid but does not produce the same result as the original code.
