***Report:***
Validity_form:True\Validity_result:False
The generated code attempts to simplify the original Monty Hall problem implementation but introduces a critical error. While the form is valid and the code structure is correct (Validity_form=true), the logic for 'win_switch' is flawed. The original code correctly calculates a 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors, but the generated code shows 0 probability (Validity_result=false). The issue lies in how 'open_door' is handled in the switching scenario - it doesn't properly account for Monty's door-opening behavior in all cases.
