Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is largely correct and consistent with the original code. The main difference is the use of 'snail' instead of 'snails' in the generated code, which is a minor inconsistency but does not affect the logic or the result. The generated code maintains all the constraints and relationships specified in the original code, and the running results of both pieces of code are identical, indicating that the generated code meets the requirements.
