Validity_form:True\Validity_result:False
The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but introduces a change in the 'bb' predicate by replacing 'II is I+1, pick(II,b)' with 'pick(I+1, b)'. This change alters the logic slightly, leading to a different probability calculation for 'bb(5)'. The original code results in 0.3750, while the generated code results in 0.6484, indicating a significant difference in the computed probability. The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements, but the result inconsistency suggests a logical divergence from the original intent.
