Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue: the original code uses 'snails' while the generated code uses 'snail'. Despite this, the running results are consistent, producing the same solution to the zebra puzzle. The generated code maintains all the logical constraints and structure of the original, ensuring the same output.
