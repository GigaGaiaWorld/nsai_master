Validity_form:True\Validity_result:False
The generated code attempts to simplify the original Monty Hall problem implementation but fails to produce correct results. While the code structure is valid and the approach using findall is interesting, it incorrectly calculates the win_switch probability (0.0000 vs expected 0.6667). The main issue is in the open_door rules which don't properly handle all scenarios of door opening, particularly when there's only one non-prize, non-selected door available.
