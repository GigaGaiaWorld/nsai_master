  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It accurately models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for prize selection, door opening, and winning outcomes. The generated code simplifies some conditions by explicitly stating the constraints (A \\= Selected, B \\= Selected) and ensures the same logical flow. Both codes produce identical results, confirming their equivalence."
