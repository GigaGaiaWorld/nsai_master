  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog, with the same base and recursive cases. The generated code renames the 'insert_element' predicate to 'insert', but this does not affect the logic or outcome. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list for the given input."
