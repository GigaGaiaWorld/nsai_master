  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of digit images into a numerical value, and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these numbers. This is a valid extension of the original code's concept. The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements. The running result correctly shows the addition of 79 and 312 to yield 391, demonstrating consistency with the original code's logic but applied to multi-digit numbers."
