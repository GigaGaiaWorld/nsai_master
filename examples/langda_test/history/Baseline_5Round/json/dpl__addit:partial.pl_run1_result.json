  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it introduces an unnecessary constraint that Z must be a digit image (digit(Z,Zval)), which was not present in the original code. This change makes the query fail because there is no digit image for the number 11. The original code correctly computes the sum and binds it to Z without requiring Z to be a digit image."
