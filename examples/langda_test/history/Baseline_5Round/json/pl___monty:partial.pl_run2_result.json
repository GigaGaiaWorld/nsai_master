  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes model the Monty Hall problem accurately, with the same probability distributions for prize selection, door opening, and winning outcomes (keep vs. switch). The generated code improves clarity by explicitly stating the selected door and ensuring doors are distinct, but the logic remains equivalent. The running results are identical, confirming the generated code meets expectations."
