  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. Both codes define the same set of digit facts and an addition predicate that sums the digits associated with two images. The only difference is the variable names used in the addition predicate (A and B in the generated code vs. X2 and Y2 in the original), which does not affect the logic or outcome. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same output for the query addition(img_5,img_6,Z)."
