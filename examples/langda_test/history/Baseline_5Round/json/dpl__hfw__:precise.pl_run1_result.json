  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, particularly for subtraction, multiplication, and division, by changing the order of operands in the 'almost_equal' predicate. This change leads to a runtime error because the 'almost_equal' predicate expects ground terms for comparison, but the new order creates uninstantiated variables during evaluation. The original code correctly handles these operations by ensuring proper instantiation before comparison."
