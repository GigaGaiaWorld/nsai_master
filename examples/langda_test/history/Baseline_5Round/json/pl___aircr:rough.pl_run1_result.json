  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main changes are in the variable names and the structure of the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, which has been reorganized for clarity but maintains the same operational semantics. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expectations."
