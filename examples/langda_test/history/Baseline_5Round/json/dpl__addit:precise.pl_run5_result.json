  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image references into a multi-digit number, and then performs addition with another such number. This is a valid extension of the original concept, which only handled single-digit additions. The generated code is consistent with the original in terms of logic but operates on a more complex input type. The result is correct as it accurately sums 79 and 312 to get 391."
