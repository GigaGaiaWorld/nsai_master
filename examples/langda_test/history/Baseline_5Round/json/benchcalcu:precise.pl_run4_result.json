  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a critical issue in the generated code where the final carry (Carry3) is constrained to be 0, which is not present in the original code. This additional constraint likely causes the generated code to fail to find any valid solutions, as evidenced by the run result showing 0.0000 probability for any solution. The original code successfully finds multiple valid solutions without this constraint."
