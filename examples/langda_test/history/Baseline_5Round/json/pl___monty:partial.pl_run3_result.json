  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for prize locations, door selection, and outcomes for keeping or switching doors. The generated code improves clarity by explicitly stating the selected door in the conditions for opening doors, making the logic more transparent. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
