  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause, which causes an error during execution. Specifically, the line 'coin(C)' in the generated code is problematic because 'C' is not instantiated, leading to a non-ground probabilistic clause error. This differs from the original code where 'coin(CNT)' is properly instantiated. The original code correctly counts the number of successful coin flips, while the generated code fails to execute due to this error."
