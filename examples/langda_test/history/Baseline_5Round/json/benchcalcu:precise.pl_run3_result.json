  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally similar to the original code but introduces a critical error in the final carry check. The original code correctly handles the carry for the hundreds place by ensuring no carry is produced (C2 is used correctly). However, the generated code incorrectly checks Carry3 (which should not exist in this problem) instead of ensuring the hundreds place addition produces no carry. This logical error causes the generated code to fail to find any valid solutions, as evidenced by the result showing 0.0000 probability for any solution."
