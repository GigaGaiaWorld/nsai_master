  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. However, there are two notable differences: 1) The 'implies' implementation in the generated code requires both A and B to be provable, whereas the original code succeeds if either A is unprovable or B is provable. 2) The 'refute' implementation in the generated code checks for the existence of a clause, while the original code checks for the provability of the goal. Despite these differences, the running results are consistent with the original code for the given queries."
