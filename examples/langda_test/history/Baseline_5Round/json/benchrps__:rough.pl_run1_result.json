  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the original logic by introducing a 'play_round' predicate with conditional statements. However, it contains a syntax error in the conditional operator '->' which is not properly formatted for Prolog, leading to a runtime error. The original code correctly uses separate clauses for each game outcome, while the generated code's approach is conceptually similar but incorrectly implemented. Both codes aim to achieve the same functionality of determining the winner in a rock-paper-scissors game, but the generated code fails to execute due to syntax issues."
