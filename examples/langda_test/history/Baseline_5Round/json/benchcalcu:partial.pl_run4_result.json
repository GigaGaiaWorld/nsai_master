  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes aim to solve the cryptoaddition problem AB + BCD = CDE with the same constraints. The generated code correctly maintains the digit definitions, leftdigit constraints, and all_different checks. However, there is a minor redundancy in the generated code where 'digit(B)' is checked twice (once in leftdigit(B) and once explicitly). The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code meets the expected outcomes."
