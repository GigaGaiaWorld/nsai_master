  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It maintains the same stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation. The only difference is the replacement of 'insertion_sort' with the built-in 'sort' predicate, which is more efficient and achieves the same result. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
