  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image references into a multi-digit number and a 'multi_addition' predicate that performs addition on these numbers. The code is correct and meets the requirements, as it successfully calculates the sum of two multi-digit numbers represented by image lists. The result is consistent with the original code's logic but applied to more complex inputs."
