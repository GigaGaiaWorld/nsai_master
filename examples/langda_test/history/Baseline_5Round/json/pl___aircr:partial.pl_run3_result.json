  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code, with only minor syntactic differences that do not affect functionality. The main change is in the 'goal_reached' predicate, where the generated code checks 'flap_position(Time,Pos)' before 'goal(Pos)', which is logically equivalent to the original. The 'overrun_exception' predicate in the generated code explicitly includes 'Time > 0', which was implicit in the original. These changes do not alter the program's behavior, as evidenced by identical run results."
