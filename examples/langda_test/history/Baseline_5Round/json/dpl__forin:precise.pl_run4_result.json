  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog, and the logic is identical. The variable name 'TSorted' in the original code was changed to 'SortedTail' in the generated code, but this does not affect the functionality or correctness of the code. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list."
