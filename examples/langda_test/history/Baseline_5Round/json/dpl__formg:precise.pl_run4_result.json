  "final_report": "The generated code is identical to the original code in both structure and functionality. It correctly implements the merge sort algorithm in Prolog, including the base cases, splitting of the list, and merging of sorted sublists. The running results for both codes are also identical, producing the correct sorted list [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] for the input [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12] with a probability of 1.0000. There are no apparent issues or discrepancies between the original and generated code."
