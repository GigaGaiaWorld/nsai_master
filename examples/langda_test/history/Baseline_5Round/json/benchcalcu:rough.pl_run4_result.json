  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. Both codes aim to solve the cryptoaddition problem AB + BCD = CDE with the same constraints. However, the generated code fails to produce valid results, as indicated by the run result showing a probability of 0.0000 for all queries. This suggests a potential issue in the implementation, possibly in the handling of carries or the all_different constraint. The original code successfully finds multiple valid solutions, while the generated code does not."
