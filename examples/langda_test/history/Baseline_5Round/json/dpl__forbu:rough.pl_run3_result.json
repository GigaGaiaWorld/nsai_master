  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm but contains syntax errors and logical inconsistencies. The main issue is the use of '->' operator which is not correctly implemented, leading to a runtime error. The original code uses a helper predicate 'hole/4' and 'swap/3' to manage comparisons and swaps, while the generated code tries to inline this logic but fails due to incorrect syntax. The generated code does not produce the correct sorted list as the original does."
