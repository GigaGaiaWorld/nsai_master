  "final_report": "The generated code is structurally similar to the original code but contains a critical error in the hundreds column calculation. The original code correctly uses `sumdigit(C2, 0, B, C, 0)` while the generated code incorrectly uses `sumdigit(0, B, Carry2, C, _)`. This error prevents the code from finding valid solutions, as evidenced by the run result showing probability 0.0000 for all queries. The generated code is valid in form but fails to produce correct results."
