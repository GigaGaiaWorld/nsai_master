  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm in Prolog, including the base cases for empty and single-element lists, the recursive splitting and merging of lists, and the helper append predicate. The only difference is the renaming of 'split_list' to 'split' in the generated code, which does not affect the functionality. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the correct sorted list."
