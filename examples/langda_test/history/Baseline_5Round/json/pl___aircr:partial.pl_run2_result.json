  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code, with only minor syntactic differences that do not affect the logic or functionality. The main change is in the 'goal_reached' predicate, where the order of conditions is rearranged but semantically equivalent. The generated code maintains all the original functionality and constraints, including the flap position logic, actuator strength, wind effects, and goal checking. Both codes produce identical results, indicating correct implementation."
