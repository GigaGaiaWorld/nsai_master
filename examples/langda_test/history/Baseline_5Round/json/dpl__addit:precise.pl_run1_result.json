  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate that converts a list of image references into a multi-digit number, and then performs addition. This is a valid extension of the original concept, which only handled single-digit additions. The code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements. The running result correctly shows the addition of 79 and 312 to yield 391, demonstrating that the extended functionality works as intended."
