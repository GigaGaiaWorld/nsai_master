  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains all the constraints and logic of the original Zebra puzzle solution. The only difference is the redefinition of the 'next_to' predicate, which now explicitly uses 'right_of' to check adjacency in both directions, making it more explicit but functionally equivalent to the original. Both codes produce the same correct solution to the puzzle."
