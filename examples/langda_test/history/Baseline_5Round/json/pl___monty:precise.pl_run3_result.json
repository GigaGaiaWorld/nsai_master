  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It accurately models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for prize selection, door opening, and win conditions. The generated code simplifies some conditions by explicitly stating the selected door and ensuring the opened door is neither the selected one nor has the prize. Both codes produce identical results, confirming their equivalence."
