  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot). However, it introduces a base case for an empty stack which was not present in the original code. The main issue is with the 'sort' operation, which fails due to a missing 'append/3' clause, indicating an incomplete implementation or missing dependencies. The original code did not include the 'insertion_sort' and 'append' predicates, which are necessary for the 'sort' operation to work."
