  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a minor issue in the `compute_score` predicate for the 'draw' case. The original code correctly updates the score by keeping it the same (S is S1), while the generated code mistakenly omits this update (just computes S1 without assigning it to S). Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent for the given query, producing the same output."
