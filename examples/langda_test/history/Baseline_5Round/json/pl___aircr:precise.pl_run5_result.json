  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but contains a critical syntax error in the 'attempted_flap_position' rule. The error occurs due to incorrect usage of the '->' operator, which is not properly formatted in Problog. This makes the generated code invalid and unable to run, unlike the original code which executes successfully. The original code uses 'sign(GP-Old)*AS' to determine the direction, while the generated code attempts to use a conditional statement incorrectly."
