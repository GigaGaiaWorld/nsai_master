  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for prize selection, door selection, and outcomes for keeping or switching doors. The generated code simplifies some conditions by explicitly stating the selected door and ensuring the opened door is neither the selected one nor has the prize, which is logically equivalent to the original code's constraints. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
