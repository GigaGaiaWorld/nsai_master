  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has a critical issue in the 'expand' rule definition. The original code defines specific expand rules like 'double(X)' and 'square(X)', whereas the generated code incorrectly defines a generic 'expand(X,Y)' rule, leading to an evaluation error. This makes the generated code invalid for the intended queries, particularly for 'prove(expand(double(3),6))'. The running results are inconsistent due to this error."
