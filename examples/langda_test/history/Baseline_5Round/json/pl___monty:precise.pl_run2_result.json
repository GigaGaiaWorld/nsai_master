  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining consistency with the original code's functionality. Both codes produce identical results, with win_keep at 0.3333 and win_switch at 0.6667, which aligns with the expected probabilities. The generated code improves clarity by explicitly handling the selection of doors and ensuring the host's door opening rules are correctly enforced. No issues are detected in the generated code."
