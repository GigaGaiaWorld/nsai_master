  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It correctly implements the rock-paper-scissors game rules and computes the winner based on the moves provided. The main difference is the use of 'outcome/3' predicate in the generated code instead of 'result/3' in the original code, but both serve the same purpose. The generated code is valid and produces the same result as the original code."
