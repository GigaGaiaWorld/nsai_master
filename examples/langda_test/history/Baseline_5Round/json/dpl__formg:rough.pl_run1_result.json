  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both implement merge sort correctly with similar base cases, recursive splitting, and merging. However, the generated code includes a redundant definition of 'length/2', which conflicts with Prolog's built-in predicate, causing an error during execution. This makes the generated code invalid in its current form."
