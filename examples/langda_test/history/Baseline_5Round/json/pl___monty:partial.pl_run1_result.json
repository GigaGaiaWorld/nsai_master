  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes of keeping or switching doors. The generated code simplifies some conditions and makes the logic clearer by explicitly stating the constraints on door selection and prize locations. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
