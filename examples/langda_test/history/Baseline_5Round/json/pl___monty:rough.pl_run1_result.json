  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the original Monty Hall problem implementation but introduces a critical flaw. While the form is valid and the code structure is correct, the logic for 'win_switch' fails because it doesn't properly account for the host's door-opening behavior. The original code correctly calculates a 2/3 chance of winning by switching, but the generated code shows 0% chance, which is incorrect for the Monty Hall problem."
