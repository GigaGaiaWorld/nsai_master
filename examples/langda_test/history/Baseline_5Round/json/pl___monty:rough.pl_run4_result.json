  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the original Monty Hall problem implementation but introduces a critical error. While the form is valid and the code structure is correct, the logic for 'open_door' is flawed. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic nature of door opening when two non-prize doors are available, and deterministically opens the only remaining non-prize door when only one exists. The generated code fails to maintain this behavior, leading to incorrect 'win_switch' probability (0.0000 instead of 0.6667). This makes the results inconsistent with the original code."
