  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error in the use of the '->' operator, which is not correctly implemented in Problog. The original code uses a disjunction with ';' to handle both cases of coin toss outcomes, while the generated code attempts to use a conditional '->' operator, which is not supported in this context. This leads to an 'UnknownClause' error during execution. The generated code does not meet the requirements and fails to produce consistent results with the original code."
