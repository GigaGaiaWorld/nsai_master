  "final_report": "The generated code introduces unnecessary constraints by requiring Z to be a digit image (digit(Z,Zval)) and checking Zval equals Xval + Yval. This makes the query fail because there's no digit image defined for the sum 11. The original code simply computes the sum without these constraints. The generated code's form is valid but its logic is flawed for this specific requirement."
