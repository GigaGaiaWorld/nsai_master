  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It successfully implements all stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) as specified. The sorting operation has been reimplemented using a helper predicate 'sort3' which correctly sorts three elements, and the results match the original implementation. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
