  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and meets the requirements. It implements a bubble sort algorithm similar to the original code but with a different structure. The generated code uses a helper predicate 'bubble' to find the maximum element in the list and accumulates the sorted elements in the accumulator 'Acc'. The original code uses 'hole' and 'swap' predicates to perform the sorting. Despite the structural differences, both codes produce the same sorted result for the given input. The generated code is valid and the results are consistent with the original code."
