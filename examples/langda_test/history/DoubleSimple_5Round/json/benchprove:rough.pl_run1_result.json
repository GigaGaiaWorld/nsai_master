  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to replicate the functionality of the original code but introduces several issues. The main problem is in the redefinition of predicates like 'implies', 'opposite', 'expand', 'includes', 'extend', and 'refute' outside the 'prove' framework, which conflicts with the original meta-interpreter structure. This causes the code to fail during execution, as evidenced by the timeout error. The original code correctly embeds these predicates within the 'prove' predicate, ensuring proper evaluation within the meta-interpreter context."
