  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and meets the requirements. It implements a bubble sort algorithm similar to the original code but with a different structure. The generated code uses a helper function 'bubble' to find the maximum element in each pass and accumulates the sorted list in reverse order, which is then correctly ordered in the 'bubblesort' predicate. The results of both the original and generated code are consistent, producing the same sorted list for the given input. The generated code is valid and functionally equivalent to the original code."
