  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly models the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes (win_keep and win_switch). The generated code introduces minor syntactic changes, such as adding 'select_door(Selected)' in the open_door rules, but these do not affect the logic or results. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their consistency."
