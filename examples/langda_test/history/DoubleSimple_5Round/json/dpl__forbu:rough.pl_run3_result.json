  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm, and their running results are identical, producing the same sorted list. The generated code simplifies the original by removing the 'hole' and 'swap' predicates, directly comparing and swapping elements within the 'bubble' predicate. This makes the generated code more straightforward and easier to understand while maintaining the same sorting logic."
