  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. The main difference lies in the second clause of the 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))' predicate, where the generated code uses 'goto_fails(T)' instead of '\\+ goto_succeeds(T)'. However, this change does not affect the overall logic or the results, as both formulations correctly handle the case when the goto action fails. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code meets the expected behavior."
