  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause error, which occurs because the variable 'C' in 'coin(C)' is not properly instantiated before being used in a probabilistic context. This makes the generated code invalid. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic coin flips by using 'coin(CNT)' in a way that ensures proper grounding. The generated code fails to replicate this behavior, leading to a runtime error."
