  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm in Prolog, including the helper predicates append, split (or split_list in the original), and merge. The generated code correctly sorts the list [3,1,2,5,7,12] into [1,2,3,5,7,12], matching the original code's output. The only difference is the renaming of 'split_list' to 'split' in the generated code, which does not affect the logic or outcome. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
