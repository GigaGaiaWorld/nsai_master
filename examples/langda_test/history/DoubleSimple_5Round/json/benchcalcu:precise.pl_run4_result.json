  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. It incorrectly repeats the definitions of predicates like 'digit', 'leftdigit', 'all_different', 'member', and 'sumdigit' within the 'query_sum' predicate, which is syntactically incorrect and leads to a malformed Prolog program. The original code clearly separates these definitions and uses them correctly. The running result of the generated code is also invalid, as it only returns a generic variable form without any concrete solutions, unlike the original code which provides specific valid solutions to the cryptarithmetic problem."
