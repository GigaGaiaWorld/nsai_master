  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the parsing logic by handling binary operations directly, which differs from the original code's recursive approach for handling expressions of arbitrary length. This simplification leads to incorrect results for complex expressions like the one in the query. The original code correctly evaluates the expression '2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7' to -10.333, while the generated code incorrectly evaluates it to 11.666 due to its inability to properly handle operator precedence and nested expressions."
