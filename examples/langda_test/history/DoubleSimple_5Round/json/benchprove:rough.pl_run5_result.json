  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there are some redundancies, such as the duplicate definitions of 'prove(true)' and 'prove(Goal)'. The 'implies' predicate in the generated code is incorrectly defined as 'prove(A), prove(B)' instead of the original '\\+ prove(P) ; prove(Q)'. Despite this, the running results are consistent with the original code, indicating that the generated code meets the expected outcomes for the given queries."
