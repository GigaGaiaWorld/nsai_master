  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for the 'draw' case. The original code correctly updates the score by keeping it the same (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes Rs directly without updating the score (compute_score(Rs, S)). This could lead to incorrect score calculations in some cases. However, in the provided test case, both codes produce the same result because the error does not affect the final outcome."
