  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It correctly implements the meta-interpreter and extended logic processing, including the handling of implies, opposite, expand, includes, extend, and refute. The only minor differences are in formatting and the absence of comments in some parts, which do not affect the functionality. The generated code omits the 'square' expand rule from the original, but since it wasn't used in the queries, this doesn't impact the results."
