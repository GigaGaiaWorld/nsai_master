  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It successfully replicates the constraints and structure of the original zebra puzzle solver. The only minor difference is the reordering of predicate definitions and the simplification of the 'next_to' predicate, which now directly uses 'right_of' for both directions. This change does not affect the correctness or performance of the code. Both codes produce identical results, solving the puzzle with the same house configurations."
