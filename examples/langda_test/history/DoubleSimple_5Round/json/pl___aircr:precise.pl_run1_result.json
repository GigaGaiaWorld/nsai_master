  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code. The main difference is in the reordering of conditions in the 'attempted_flap_position' rule, which does not affect the logic or outcomes. Both codes produce identical results, as evidenced by the matching inference results for 'goal_reached' and 'overrun_exception' queries across all time steps."
