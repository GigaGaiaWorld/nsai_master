  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. The main difference lies in the second clause of the 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))' predicate, where the generated code uses 'do(goto(_),T)' instead of 'do(goto(Pos),T)' as in the original. This change does not affect the functionality since the underscore acts as a wildcard and the position is already captured in the 'at(robot,Pos,T)' predicate. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the generated code correctly replicates the behavior of the original code."
