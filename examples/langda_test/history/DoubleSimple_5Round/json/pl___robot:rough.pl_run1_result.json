  "final_report": "The generated code has significant differences from the original code. The first rule of 'carrying(key,s(T))' in the generated code is simplified and lacks the conditions 'at(robot,Pos,T)' and 'at(key,Pos,T)', which are crucial for the correct logic. The second rule is also altered, replacing the original conditions with 'retains_key(T)', which changes the logic entirely. These changes lead to different probabilities in the results, as seen in the 'carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))' and 'at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))' values. The generated code is not consistent with the original logic and produces different results."
