  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It includes all the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and the sorting operation with the necessary helper predicates (get_top_n and insertion_sort). However, the generated code has redundant repetitions of the stack_op(sort) and get_top_n predicates, and the queries are duplicated at the end. Despite this, the functionality remains intact, and the running results are identical to the original code."
