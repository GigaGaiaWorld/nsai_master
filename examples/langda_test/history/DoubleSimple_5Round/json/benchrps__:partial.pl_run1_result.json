  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It correctly implements the rock-paper-scissors game rules and the result calculation logic. However, there is a minor issue in the `compute_score` clause for `draw` where it incorrectly passes `S1` directly instead of assigning it to `S`. Despite this, the running results are consistent with the original code, producing the same output for the given query."
