  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It maintains all the essential components of the original code, including the member/2 predicate, the basic meta-interpreter, extended logic processing, and the examples/queries. The only differences are minor formatting changes and the omission of the 'square' expand rule, which does not affect the provided queries since they do not use this rule. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence in behavior."
