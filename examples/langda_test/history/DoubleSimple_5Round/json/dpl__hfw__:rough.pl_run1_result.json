  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the parsing logic by directly handling arithmetic operations in a single step, which differs from the original code's recursive approach. However, the generated code fails to correctly parse the expression due to incorrect operator precedence handling, leading to a different result (11.666...) compared to the original (-10.333...). The original code correctly handles operator precedence by transforming subtraction into addition of a negative product and properly managing nested operations."
