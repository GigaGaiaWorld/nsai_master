  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there is a subtle but significant difference in the 'bb' predicate. The original code uses 'II is I+1, pick(II,b)', while the generated code simplifies this to 'pick(I+1,b)'. This change affects the probability calculation, leading to a different result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is valid in form but produces an inconsistent result due to this modification."
