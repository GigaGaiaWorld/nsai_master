  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has a critical difference in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate. Instead of calculating the position based on the goal and current position, it hardcodes a target position (PrevPos - 2). This change alters the logic and leads to different probabilities in the results. The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results with the original code."
