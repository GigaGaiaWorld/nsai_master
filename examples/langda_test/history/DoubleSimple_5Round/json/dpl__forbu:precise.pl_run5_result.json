  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement a bubble sort algorithm in Prolog. The main difference lies in the definition of the swap/3 predicate: the original code uses negation as failure (\\+ swap(X,Y,no_swap)) for the swap case, while the generated code explicitly defines swap(X,Y,swap) :- X > Y and swap(X,Y,no_swap) :- X =< Y. This change is logically equivalent and does not affect the outcome. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the correct sorted list."
