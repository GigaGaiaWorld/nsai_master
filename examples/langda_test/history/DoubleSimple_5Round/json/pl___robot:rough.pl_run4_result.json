  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has some issues. The first rule for 'carrying(key,s(T))' is simplified and misses the 'do(pickup(key),T)' condition, which affects the logic. The second rule for 'carrying(key,s(T))' is also simplified and lacks necessary conditions like '+ do(putdown(key),T)' and '+ do(pickup(key),T)'. These omissions lead to different probabilities in the results, as seen in the 'carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))' value (0.5898 vs 0.4331). The rest of the code and results are consistent."
