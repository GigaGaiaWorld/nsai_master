  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the cryptoaddition problem. Both codes correctly implement the constraints and logic for solving AB + BCD = CDE with unique digits. The generated code has minor formatting differences (line breaks and spacing) but maintains the same logical structure and constraints. The running results are identical, confirming consistency."
