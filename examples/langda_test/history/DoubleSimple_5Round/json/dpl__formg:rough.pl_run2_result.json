  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm, similar to the original code. It uses a different approach for splitting the list, which is more concise and efficient. The merge and merge_sort predicates are functionally equivalent to the original ones. The generated code is valid and produces the same correct sorted result as the original code. There are no apparent problems in the generated code."
