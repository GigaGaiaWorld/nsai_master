  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, which leads to incorrect handling of operator precedence and associativity. Specifically, it fails to properly process nested expressions like '2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7' due to the simplified parse rules. This results in a runtime error when attempting to evaluate the expression, as the code cannot handle the groundness check in 'almost_equal'. The original code correctly processes such expressions by maintaining proper precedence and associativity through recursive parsing."
