  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot). However, the 'sort' operation in the generated code is simplified to use Prolog's built-in 'sort' predicate, which sorts the entire stack, unlike the original code that sorts only the top 3 elements. This discrepancy makes the generated code inconsistent with the original intent. The running results for the tested queries are consistent because the 'sort' operation was not tested in the queries."
