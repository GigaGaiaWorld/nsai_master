  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, which leads to incorrect handling of operator precedence and associativity. Specifically, it fails to properly process expressions with nested operations like '2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7'. The error in the run result indicates a problem with the 'almost_equal' predicate due to non-ground arguments, which was not an issue in the original code. The generated code is not consistent with the original code's behavior and fails to produce the correct result."
