  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. The only change is the decomposition of the 'sign(GP-Old)*AS' operation into two steps with 'Direction is sign(GP-Old)' and 'AE is Direction * AS', which does not affect the logic or results. The running results are identical, confirming the equivalence of the two versions."
