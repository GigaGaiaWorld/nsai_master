  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same results for the cryptoaddition problem. Both codes correctly implement the constraints and logic for solving AB + BCD = CDE with unique digits. The generated code is slightly more compact in its predicate definitions but maintains all critical components including digit constraints, sumdigit calculations, and uniqueness checks. No functional differences or problems were identified."
