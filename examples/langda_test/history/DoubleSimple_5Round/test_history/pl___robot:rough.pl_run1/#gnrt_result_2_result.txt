Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, we need to define two at/3 predicates for the robot's movement success and failure cases. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "8EB675E6","Code": "at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_succeeds(T), do(goto(Pos),T).\nat(robot,Pos,s(T)) :- goto_action(T), goto_fails(T), at(robot,Pos,T)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Defines two cases for the at/3 predicate for the robot's position
2. First case handles successful goto action (robot moves to new position)
3. Second case handles failed goto action (robot stays in current position)
4. Both cases are conditioned on goto_action(T) being true
5. Uses the existing probability facts for goto_succeeds/goto_fails
