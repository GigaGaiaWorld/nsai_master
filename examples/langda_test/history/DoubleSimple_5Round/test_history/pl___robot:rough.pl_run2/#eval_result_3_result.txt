{"HASH": "8EB675E6","ErrorSummary": "The at/3 predicate for the key's position is not properly defined when the robot is not carrying the key. The current implementation may lead to incorrect position tracking for the key.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the at/3 predicates for the key to properly handle cases when the key is not being carried. Specifically, ensure the key's position remains unchanged when not carried and update it only when the robot is carrying it.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
