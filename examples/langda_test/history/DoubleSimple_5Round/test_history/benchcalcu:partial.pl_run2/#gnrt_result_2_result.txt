Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, I'll regenerate the code snippet that defines the digits and ensures the first digit is non-zero. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "F91C6038","Code": "leftdigit(A). leftdigit(B). leftdigit(C). digit(D). digit(E)."}
```

This code ensures that:
1. The first digits (A, B, C) of each number are non-zero by using leftdigit/1
2. Other digits (D, E) can be any digit including zero by using digit/1
3. Matches the requirements specified in the <Requirements> tag

The original code template already had the digit/1 and leftdigit/1 definitions, so this snippet focuses on applying those constraints to the specific variables in the cryptarithmetic problem.
