Based on the requirements in the <langda> blocks, I'll regenerate the code snippets:

1. For the first block (HASH F91C6038) which needs to define digits and ensure first digits are non-zero:
```problog
{"HASH": "F91C6038","Code": "leftdigit(A). leftdigit(B). leftdigit(C)."}
```

2. For the second block (HASH 57FD427B) which needs to compute hundreds digit:
```problog
{"HASH": "57FD427B","Code": "sumdigit(Cout2, 0, B, C, _)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Ensures A, B, and C (the first digits of each number) are non-zero by using leftdigit/1
2. Completes the column addition by computing the hundreds digit where we add 0 (no digit) + B with carry from previous operation to get C
