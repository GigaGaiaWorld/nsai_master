Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, the current code needs to be regenerated to properly handle the case where there are two unselected doors without prizes, and the host randomly chooses one to open. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A,[1,2,3]),\n    member(B,[1,2,3]),\n    A < B,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ select_door(B)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Ensures both A and B are valid doors (1,2,3)
2. Uses A < B to avoid duplicate cases
3. Checks that neither door has the prize
4. Checks that neither door is the selected door
5. When all these conditions are met, gives equal probability (0.5) to opening either door

This properly implements the requirement that when two empty, unselected doors are available, the host chooses randomly between them.
