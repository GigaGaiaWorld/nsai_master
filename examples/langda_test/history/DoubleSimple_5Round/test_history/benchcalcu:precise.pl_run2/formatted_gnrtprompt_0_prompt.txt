System: You are a coding assistant.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

% Cryptoaddition:
% Find the unique answer to:
% Define available digits
digit(0).
 digit(1).
 digit(2).
 digit(3).
 digit(4).
digit(5).
 digit(6).
 digit(7).
 digit(8).
 digit(9).
% The first digit of a multi-digit number cannot be 0
leftdigit(D) :- digit(D), D =\= 0.
% All elements are different
all_different([]).
all_different([H|T]) :- \+ member(H, T), all_different(T).
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
% Simulate a column addition: Cin is the input carry, Cout is the output carry
sumdigit(Cin, A, B, Sum, Cout) :-
 X is Cin + A + B,
 ( X < 10, Sum = X, Cout = 0
 ; 
 X >= 10, Sum is X - 10, Cout = 1 ).
% Main predicate: AB + BCD = CDE
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 623E07CC </HASH>
<Requirements>please construct the alphabet math puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE with following laws:  1. Firstly define all the digits, the first digit of a multi-digit number cannot be 0 (with the help of digit/1 and leftdigit/1),  2. Different letters refer to different numbers with the help of all_different/1,  3. calculate with the help of sumdigit/5, don't forget to carry. </Requirements></Langda>
.
% Initiate query example:
query(query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])).

</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
