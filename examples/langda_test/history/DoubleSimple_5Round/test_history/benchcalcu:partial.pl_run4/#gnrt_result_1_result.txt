Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, I'll regenerate the code snippet that defines the digits and ensures the first digit is non-zero. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "F91C6038","Code": "leftdigit(A). leftdigit(B). leftdigit(C). digit(D). digit(E)."}
```

This code ensures that:
1. The first digits (A, B, C) of each number are non-zero by using leftdigit/1
2. The remaining digits (D, E) can be any digit including zero
3. Matches the hash F91C6038 from the original code block

The rest of the code template can remain as is since it's not part of the regeneration request.
