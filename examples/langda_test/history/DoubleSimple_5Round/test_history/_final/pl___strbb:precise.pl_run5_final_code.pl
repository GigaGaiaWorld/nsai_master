Validity_form:True\Validity_result:False
The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a subtle difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'pick(I+1,b)' directly instead of first calculating 'II is I+1' and then using 'pick(II,b)'. This change does not affect the logical correctness but could impact readability. The main issue is that the running results differ significantly (0.3750 vs 0.6484), indicating a potential problem in the probabilistic logic or execution. The generated code's result does not meet the expectations set by the original code's result.
