System: You are a coding assistant.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.
<Regenerate_format>
stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).
stack_op(pop, [_|Stack], Stack).
stack_op(dup, [X|Stack], [X,X|Stack]).
stack_op(swap, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X|Stack]).
stack_op(over, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X,Y|Stack]).
stack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Stack], [Z,X,Y|Stack]).
stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 6931D64E </HASH>
<Requirements>A custom stack operation: sort, which sorts the three elements at the top of the stack in ascending order and then puts them back to the original stack. </Requirements></Langda>
.
get_top_n(Stack, N, Elements, Rest) :-
 length(Elements, N),
 append(Elements, Rest, Stack).
query(stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)).
query(stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)).

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
</Regenerate_Instructions>
<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
