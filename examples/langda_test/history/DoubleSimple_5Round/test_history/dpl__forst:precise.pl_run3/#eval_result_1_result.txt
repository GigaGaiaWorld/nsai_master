{"HASH": "6931D64E","ErrorSummary": "The sort operation is incomplete and incorrectly implemented. It's missing the get_top_n predicate definition and the sort operation doesn't handle cases where stack has fewer than 3 elements.","SuggestedFix": "1. Add the get_top_n predicate definition before the sort operation. 2. Add length check to handle stacks with fewer than 3 elements. Modified code:\nstack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :- \n    length(Stack, L), \n    (L >= 3 -> \n        get_top_n(Stack, 3, Elements, Rest), \n        sort(Elements, SortedElements), \n        append(SortedElements, Rest, SortedStack)\n    ; \n        SortedStack = Stack\n    ).\nget_top_n(Stack, N, Elements, Rest) :- \n    length(Elements, N), \n    append(Elements, Rest, Stack).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
