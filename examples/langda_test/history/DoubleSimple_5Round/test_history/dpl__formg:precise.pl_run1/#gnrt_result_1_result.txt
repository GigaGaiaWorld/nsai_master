Based on the requirements in the <langda> blocks, I'll regenerate the code snippets with the specified functionality. Here are the completed code snippets:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2","Code": "merge_sort(List, Sorted) :- length(List, Len), Len > 1, split_list(List, Left, Right), merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft), merge_sort(Right, SortedRight), merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Code": "merge_sort(List, Sorted) :- length(List, Len), Len > 1, split_list(List, Left, Right), merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft), merge_sort(Right, SortedRight), merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)."}
```

Note that both code blocks actually contain the same complete merge_sort rule since it needs to handle both the recursive sorting of sublists and the merging. The rule satisfies all requirements from both <langda> blocks:
1. Gets the length of the list
2. Only processes lists longer than 1
3. Splits the list into Left and Right parts
4. Recursively sorts both halves
5. Merges the sorted halves

The other helper predicates (split_list, merge, append) remain unchanged as they weren't part of the regeneration requirements.
