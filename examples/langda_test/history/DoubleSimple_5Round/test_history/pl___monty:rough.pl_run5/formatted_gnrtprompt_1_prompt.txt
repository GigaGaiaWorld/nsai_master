System: You are a coding assistant.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

% Based on Monty Hall problem on https://github.com/friguzzi/cplint
1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).
select_door(1).
member(X,[X|T]).
member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 55F6DA26 </HASH>
<Requirements>Define two clauses of open_door/1: 1. If there are two doors A and B, neither of which has a prize, and neither of which is the door chosen by the player, then Monty will open a door uniformly at random between A and B 2. If there is only one door A that has no prize and is not the door chosen by the player, then Monty must open it` </Requirements></Langda>
win_keep :-
 select_door(A),
 prize(A).
win_switch :-
 member(A, [1,2,3]),
 \+ select_door(A),
 prize(A),
 \+ open_door(A).
query(prize(_)).
query(select_door(_)).
query(win_keep).
query(win_switch).

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
</Regenerate_Instructions>
<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
