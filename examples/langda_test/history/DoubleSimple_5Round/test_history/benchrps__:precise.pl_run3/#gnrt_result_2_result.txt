Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code for the `determine_winner` predicate that was incomplete in the original code. The new code should properly calculate the winner by:
1. Comparing the moves using play/3 to get results
2. Computing the score from those results
3. Determining the winner based on the final score

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "CE4B5362","Code": "determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- play(P1Moves,P2Moves,Results), compute_score(Results,Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; Winner = draw)."}
```
