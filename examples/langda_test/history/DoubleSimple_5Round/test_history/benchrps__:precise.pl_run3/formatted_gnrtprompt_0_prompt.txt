System: You are a coding assistant.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

% -------------------------
% Basic rules of rock-paper-scissors
% -------------------------
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).
% -------------------------
% Calculate the result of the game
% -------------------------
% Same gestures are considered a draw
result(X, X, draw) :-
 move(X).
 
% If X beats Y, then X wins
result(X, Y, win) :-
beats(X, Y).
% If Y beats X, then X loses
result(X, Y, lose) :-
beats(Y, X).
 
% End of recursion: empty list corresponds to empty result
play([], [], []).
% Recursive advancement: take out each round of gestures, calculate the results, and continue
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
% The correct call is result(P1,P2,R), not semicolon
result(P1, P2, R),
% (Optional) Update the score according to R
play(P1T, P2T, Rs).
 
compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: D324979D </HASH>
<Requirements>If the result of the current round is lose: Recursively calculate the remaining result score S1 The current total score S is S1 - 1, which means adding one point to player2 </Requirements></Langda>
.
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: FD850DEC </HASH>
<Requirements>If the current round is draw: A draw does not affect the score, and the previous round score S1 is directly passed. </Requirements></Langda>
.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: CE4B5362 </HASH>
<Requirements>Main predicate: Given two player action lists P1Moves and P2Moves, calculate the winner Winner.  Firstly, call the play/3 rule to compare the two players' actions.  Then, generate a Results list containing whether each round is win, lose, or draw </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).

</Code>
<Final_Answer>
Please generate each code in JSON form for each code block using a single problog block of the following form, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
