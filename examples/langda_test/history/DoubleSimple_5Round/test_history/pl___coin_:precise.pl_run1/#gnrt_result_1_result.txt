Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly implement the coin counting logic where the success count SC increases by 1 when a coin turns up heads, and remains unchanged otherwise, with the counter decreasing to 0.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "EA5E8D55", "Code": "PH::make_coin(C,PH).\ncoin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n (coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC),\n CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).\ntotal(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).\nquery(total(_))."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Keeps the original probability definitions for coins
2. Implements the recursive counting logic where:
   - When CNT > 0, it checks if coin(CNT) is heads
   - If heads, increments the success count (NSC is SC + 1)
   - Otherwise keeps the count unchanged (NSC = SC)
   - Decrements the counter and continues recursively
3. Maintains the same interface with total/1 and query
