{"HASH": "0805B4F6","ErrorSummary": "The predicate bb(N) does not correctly implement the requirement to check for consecutive 'b's in a string of length N. The current implementation checks for exactly one pair of consecutive 'b's, but the requirement is to succeed if any such pair exists.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the bb(N) predicate to use findall/3 or aggregate to check for any pair of consecutive 'b's in the string. For example:\nbb(N) :- between(1,N,I), I1 is I+1, I1 =< N, pick(I,b), pick(I1,b), !. \nThis ensures the predicate succeeds as soon as it finds the first pair of consecutive 'b's.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
