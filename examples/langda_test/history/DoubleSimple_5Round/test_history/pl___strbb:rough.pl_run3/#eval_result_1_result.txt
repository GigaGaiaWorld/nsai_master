{"HASH": "0805B4F6","ErrorSummary": "The bb(N) predicate is incomplete and incorrectly defined. It should check for consecutive 'b's in any position, but currently it's not properly implemented. Also, the test result shows bb(5) = 1.0000 which is incorrect as the probability should be less than 1.","SuggestedFix": "Replace the bb(N) definition with:\nbb(N) :-\n    between(1, N-1, I),\n    pick(I, b),\n    pick(I+1, b).\nThis will correctly check for consecutive 'b's at any position. Also, ensure the probabilities for pick/2 are properly defined (0.5 for each option).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
