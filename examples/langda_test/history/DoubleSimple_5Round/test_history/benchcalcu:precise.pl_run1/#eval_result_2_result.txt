{"HASH": "623E07CC","ErrorSummary": "The code produces multiple solutions that don't satisfy the original puzzle AB + BCD = CDE. Some results show incorrect sums (e.g., 47 + 782 = 829 is false)","SuggestedFix": "Modify the sumdigit constraints to properly enforce the addition equation. The current implementation allows invalid solutions because it doesn't fully verify the complete sum. Add explicit checks that AB + BCD equals CDE by converting the digits to numbers and comparing. Replace the current sumdigit calls with:\n\nAB is 10*A + B,\nBCD is 100*B + 10*C + D,\nCDE is 100*C + 10*D + E,\nSum is AB + BCD,\nSum =:= CDE.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
