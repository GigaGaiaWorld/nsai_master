Based on the requirements, I'll regenerate the code to properly define the `number` predicate that converts a list of image IDs to their corresponding integer values. The current code doesn't have this predicate defined, which is needed for the `multi_addition` predicate to work.

```problog
{"HASH": "06576BEB", "Code": "number([], 0).\nnumber([H|T], N) :- digit(H, D), number(T, NT), N is NT * 10 + D.\n\nmulti_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,X2), number(Y,Y2), Z is X2+Y2.\nquery(multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z))."}
