{"HASH": "06576BEB","ErrorSummary": "The base case for number/2 predicate is incorrect. It returns 0 for an empty list, which would cause incorrect results when processing numbers with trailing zeros.","SuggestedFix": "Change the base case to 'number([], 0).' to properly handle empty lists as zero, and ensure the recursive case correctly builds the number by multiplying by 10 for each digit position. The current implementation is actually correct for the given test case, but the error summary points out a potential issue in general usage.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
