Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code for the cryptarithmetic puzzle AB + BCD = CDE. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "35747D5A","Code": "leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C), digit(D), digit(E), all_different([A,B,C,D,E]), sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Carry1), sumdigit(Carry1, A, C, D, Carry2), sumdigit(Carry2, 0, B, C, _)."}
```

This code:
1. Ensures A, B, and C are non-zero digits (leftdigit)
2. Allows D and E to be any digits
3. Enforces all letters represent different digits
4. Sets up the column-wise addition for AB + BCD = CDE with proper carry handling
5. The underscores for final carry indicate we don't care about its value

The code follows the structure of the original template while implementing the specific cryptarithmetic puzzle requested.
