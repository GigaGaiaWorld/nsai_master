{"HASH": "5E40E418","ErrorSummary": "The sort operation implementation is incorrect as it sorts only the top 3 elements and appends the rest without sorting","SuggestedFix": "Replace the current sort implementation with one that sorts the entire stack. Modify the stack_op(sort,...) predicate to: stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack) :- insertion_sort(Stack, SortedStack). Remove the get_top_n predicate as it's not needed for the correct implementation.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
