{"HASH": "FA856BCD", "ErrorSummary": "The predicate bb(N) is incomplete and incorrectly formatted in the original code block. The test results show bb(5) returning 1.0, which suggests the implementation may not match the requirements.", "SuggestedFix": "Replace the incomplete bb(N) predicate with the correct implementation as specified in the requirements. The corrected predicate should be: bb(N) :- Max is N-1, between(1,Max,I), pick(I,b), pick(I+1,b).", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
