Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to add two `at/3` predicates for the key's position that weren't present in the original code. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "BCB17653","Code": "at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- carrying(key,T), at(robot,Pos,T).\nat(key,Pos,s(T)) :- \\+ carrying(key,s(T)), at(key,Pos,T)."}
```

The first predicate states that if the robot is carrying the key at time T and is at position Pos, then the key is also at Pos. The second predicate states that if the robot is not carrying the key at the next time step (s(T)), then the key remains where it was at time T (stationary). These rules implement the requirements that:
1. When carrying the key, it moves with the robot
2. When not carrying the key, it stays in place
