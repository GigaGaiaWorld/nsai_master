Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code snippet that calculates the attempted flap position based on previous position, actuator used, and wind effect. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A5C06F43","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-\n Time > 0,\n Prev is Time-1,\n flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),\n \+ goal_reached(Prev),\n use_actuator(Time,Actuator),\n actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),\n wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),\n goal(Target),\n (Target > PrevPos -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1),\n Pos is PrevPos + Direction * Strength + WindEffect."}
```

This code:
1. Takes the previous flap position
2. Checks if goal hasn't been reached yet
3. Gets the actuator being used and its strength
4. Incorporates wind effect
5. Determines movement direction based on target position
6. Calculates new attempted position considering all factors
