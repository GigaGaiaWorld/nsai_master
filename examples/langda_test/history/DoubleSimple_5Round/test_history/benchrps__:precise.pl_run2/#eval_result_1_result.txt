{"HASH": "CE4B5362", "ErrorSummary": "Syntax error in predicate definition - missing period at end of clause", "SuggestedFix": "Add a period at the end of the determine_winner predicate definition (line 41)", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
```

The main error in the code appears to be a syntax error in the determine_winner predicate where it's missing a terminating period. The error message indicates the system is looking for a clause for '/2' which suggests it's encountering malformed syntax. The fix is simply to add the missing period at the end of the determine_winner predicate definition.

The other modules (compute_score for lose and draw cases) are correctly implemented and don't require modifications. The error is isolated to the determine_winner predicate definition.
