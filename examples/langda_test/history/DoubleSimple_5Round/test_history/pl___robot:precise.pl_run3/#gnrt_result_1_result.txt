Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to add two `at/3` predicates for the key's position that weren't present in the original code. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "BCB17653","Code": "at(key,Pos,s(T)) :- carrying(key,T), at(robot,Pos,T).\nat(key,Pos,s(T)) :- at(key,Pos,T), \\+ carrying(key,T)."}
```

The regenerated code adds two new rules:
1. The first rule states that if the robot is carrying the key at time T and is at position Pos, then the key will also be at position Pos at the next time step (s(T)).
2. The second rule states that if the robot is not carrying the key at time T, then the key will remain at its current position in the next time step.

These rules satisfy both requirements from the <Requirements> section:
- They ensure the key moves with the robot when being carried
- They ensure the key stays stationary when not being carried
