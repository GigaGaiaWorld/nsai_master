Based on the requirements in the <langda> blocks, I'll regenerate the code snippets with the specified functionality. Here are the completed code snippets:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2","Code": "merge_sort(List, Sorted) :- length(List, Len), Len > 1, split_list(List, Left, Right), merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft), merge_sort(Right, SortedRight), merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "26E82D5D","Code": "merge_sort(List, Sorted) :- length(List, Len), Len > 1, split_list(List, Left, Right), merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft), merge_sort(Right, SortedRight), merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)."}
```

Note that both code blocks actually contain the same complete implementation of merge_sort, as the requirements in both blocks describe different aspects of the same recursive sorting process. The regenerated code:
1. Gets the length of the list to determine if sorting is needed
2. Only processes lists longer than 1 element
3. Splits the list into Left and Right parts
4. Recursively sorts both halves
5. Merges the sorted halves together

The split_list, merge, and append predicates remain unchanged as they were correctly implemented in the original code.
