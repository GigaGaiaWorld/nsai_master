Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly handle the case when both unselected doors are empty (no prize). The current code needs to be modified to randomly open one of the two empty doors in this scenario.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "C5B4A895","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :- select_door(S), member(A,[1,2,3]), member(B,[1,2,3]), A < B, \+ prize(A), \+ prize(B), \+ select_door(A), \+ select_door(B)."}
```

This solution:
1. Selects two distinct doors (A and B with A < B to avoid duplicate cases)
2. Checks that neither door has the prize
3. Checks that neither door was selected
4. Then randomly opens one of them with equal probability (0.5 for each)

This satisfies the requirement to randomly open one of the empty unselected doors when both remaining doors are empty.
