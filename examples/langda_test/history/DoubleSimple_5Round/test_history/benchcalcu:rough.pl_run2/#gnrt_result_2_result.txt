Based on the requirements, I'll regenerate the code for the cryptoaddition puzzle AB + BCD = CDE. Here's the completed code snippet:

```problog
{"HASH": "35747D5A","Code": "leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C), digit(D), digit(E), all_different([A,B,C,D,E]), sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Cout1), sumdigit(Cout1, A, C, D, Cout2), sumdigit(Cout2, 0, B, C, _)."}
```

This code:
1. Ensures A, B, and C are non-zero left digits
2. Allows D and E to be any digits (including 0)
3. Checks all letters represent different digits
4. Models the column-wise addition from right to left with proper carry propagation
5. Matches the structure of AB + BCD = CDE through digit-wise summation with carries
