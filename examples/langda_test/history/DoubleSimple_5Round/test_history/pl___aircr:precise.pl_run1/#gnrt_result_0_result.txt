Based on the requirements, I'll complete the `attempted_flap_position` predicate and provide it in the requested JSON format. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "62719B9D","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- Time > 0, Prev is Time-1, flap_position(Prev,Old), \+ goal_reached(Prev), goal(GP), use_actuator(Time,A), actuator_strength(A,AS), AE is sign(GP-Old)*AS, wind_effect(Time,WE), Pos is Old + AE + WE."}
