Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly sample CNT independent coins and accumulate the number of heads. The current code is incomplete and doesn't implement the coin tossing logic.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","Code": "PH::make_coin(C,PH).\ncoin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n coin(CNT),\n SC1 is SC + 1,\n CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n coins_r(SC1,S,CNT1).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n \+coin(CNT),\n CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n coins_r(SC,S,CNT1).\ntotal(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).\nquery(total(_))."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Properly handles the coin tossing for CNT coins
2. Has two cases for coins_r: one when the coin lands heads (adding 1 to the count) and one when it lands tails (keeping the count the same)
3. Decrements the counter properly in both cases
4. Maintains the same interface with the total/1 predicate and query
