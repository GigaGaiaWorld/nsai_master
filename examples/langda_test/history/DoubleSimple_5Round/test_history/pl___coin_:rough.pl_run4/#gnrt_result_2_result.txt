Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly sample CNT independent coins and accumulate the number of heads. The current code is incomplete and doesn't implement the coin tossing logic.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","Code": "PH::make_coin(C,PH).\ncoin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n coin(CNT),\n (coin(CNT) -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC = SC),\n NewCNT is CNT - 1,\n coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT).\ntotal(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).\nquery(total(_))."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Keeps the original probability definitions
2. Completes the coins_r predicate to:
   - Sample a coin toss for the current count
   - Increment the head count if the toss is successful
   - Decrement the counter and recurse
3. Maintains the same interface with total/1 and query
4. Properly accumulates the number of heads across all coin tosses
