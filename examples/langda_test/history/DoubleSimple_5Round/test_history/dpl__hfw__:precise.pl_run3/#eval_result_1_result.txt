{"HASH": "9BA21093","ErrorSummary": "The error occurs in the almost_equal predicate when handling non-ground variables in arithmetic operations. The current implementation fails when comparing non-ground expressions like abs(X1-2*7.0) with 0.0001.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the almost_equal predicate to handle both ground and non-ground cases properly. The fix should ensure arithmetic operations are only performed on ground terms. Here's the corrected version:\n\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- \n    ground(X), ground(Y), \n    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- \n    ground(X), var(Y), \n    Y is float(X).\n\nThis ensures both arguments are properly checked for being ground before arithmetic operations are attempted.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
