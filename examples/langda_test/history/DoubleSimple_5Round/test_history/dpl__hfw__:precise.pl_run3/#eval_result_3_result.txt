The current implementation fails when Y is not ground in the second clause of almost_equal.", "SuggestedFix": "Modify the almost_equal predicate to handle both ground and non-ground cases properly. Replace the existing almost_equal clauses with:\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- ground(X), ground(Y), abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- ground(X), var(Y), Y is float(X).\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- ground(Y), var(X), X is float(Y).", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": true}
