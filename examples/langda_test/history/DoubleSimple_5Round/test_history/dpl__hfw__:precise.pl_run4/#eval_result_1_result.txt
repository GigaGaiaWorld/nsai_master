{"HASH": "9BA21093","ErrorSummary": "The error occurs in the almost_equal predicate when handling non-ground arguments in the arithmetic comparison. The current implementation tries to compare non-ground variables which isn't allowed in Problog's arithmetic operations.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the parse/2 rules to ensure all arithmetic operations are performed before calling almost_equal. Change the parse rules to:\nparse([N1,+|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 + R2, almost_equal(R, N1 + R2).\nparse([N1,-|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 - R2, almost_equal(R, N1 - R2).\nparse([N1,*|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 * R2, almost_equal(R, N1 * R2).\nparse([N1,/|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 / R2, almost_equal(R, N1 / R2).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
