{"HASH": "FA856BCD","ErrorSummary": "The predicate bb(N) is incomplete in the original code block (missing implementation) and has incorrect test results (should not always be true)","SuggestedFix": "Replace the incomplete bb(N) definition with the correct implementation from the <Requirements> section. The correct implementation should be: bb(N) :- Max is N-1, between(1,Max,I), pick(I,b), pick(I+1,b). Also, the test result should show a probability less than 1.0 since adjacent b's have 0.25 probability for each pair.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
