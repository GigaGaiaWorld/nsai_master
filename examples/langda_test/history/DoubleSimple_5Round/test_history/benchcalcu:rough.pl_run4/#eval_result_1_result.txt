The constraints are not strict enough to enforce uniqueness.","SuggestedFix": "Add additional constraints to ensure the sum AB + BCD equals CDE numerically. Modify the query_sum predicate to include: AB is 10*A + B, BCD is 100*B + 10*C + D, CDE is 100*C + 10*D + E, and AB + BCD =:= CDE.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
