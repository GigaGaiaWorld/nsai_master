Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I need to regenerate the parse/2 predicate to handle arithmetic operations in a list format, with each operation as a separate rule. The current implementation only handles single numbers.

Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "FB41E2F7","Code": "parse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R).\nparse([N1, +, N2|T], R) :- R1 is N1 + N2, parse([R1|T], R).\nparse([N1, -, N2|T], R) :- R1 is N1 - N2, parse([R1|T], R).\nparse([N1, *, N2|T], R) :- R1 is N1 * N2, parse([R1|T], R).\nparse([N1, /, N2|T], R) :- R1 is N1 / N2, parse([R1|T], R)."}
```

This implementation:
1. Keeps the base case for single numbers
2. Adds separate rules for each arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /)
3. Each operation rule recursively processes the remaining list
4. Maintains the almost_equal functionality from the original
5. Follows the requirement of having each operation as a separate parse/2 predicate
