Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the code to properly handle the case where there are two empty doors (neither selected nor containing the prize) and the host randomly chooses one to open. Here's the corrected code:

```problog
{"HASH": "A4F0EAE2","Code": "0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(A,[1,2,3]),\n    member(B,[1,2,3]),\n    A < B,\n    \+ prize(A),\n    \+ prize(B),\n    \+ select_door(A),\n    \+ select_door(B)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Ensures there are exactly two doors (A and B) that are not selected and don't contain the prize
2. Uses A < B to ensure each pair is only considered once
3. Gives each door a 50% probability of being opened when both are empty
4. Maintains the original requirements of the Monty Hall problem while fixing the random selection between two empty doors
