Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, I'll regenerate the code snippet that defines the digits and ensures first digits are non-zero. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "F91C6038","Code": "leftdigit(A). leftdigit(B). leftdigit(C)."}
```

This code ensures that:
1. The first digits (A, B, and C) of each number in the cryptarithmetic puzzle cannot be zero
2. It maintains the original hash identifier
3. It follows the Problog syntax without comments as requested

The rest of the code template doesn't need regeneration as it wasn't marked with <Langda> blocks requiring changes.
