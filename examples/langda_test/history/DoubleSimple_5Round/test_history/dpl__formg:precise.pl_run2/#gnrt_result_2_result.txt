Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, I'll regenerate the merge_sort predicate to properly handle the recursive boundary and splitting logic. Here's the completed code:

```problog
{"HASH": "95E704F2","Code": "merge_sort([], []).\nmerge_sort([X], [X]).\nmerge_sort(List, Sorted) :-\n    length(List, Len),\n    Len > 1,\n    split_list(List, Left, Right),\n    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),\n    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),\n    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Includes length check (Len > 1) to determine when to continue splitting
2. Properly handles the base cases (empty list and single-element list)
3. Splits the list and recursively processes both halves before merging
4. Maintains all the required helper predicates (split_list, merge, append) from the original code
