{"HASH": "0805B4F6","ErrorSummary": "The predicate bb(N) is incorrectly implemented as it uses between/3 which is not standard in ProbLog and may cause issues. Additionally, the condition I1 =< N is redundant since between/3 already ensures I ranges from 1 to N-1.","SuggestedFix": "Replace the between/3 usage with a standard ProbLog recursive approach or use a for-loop equivalent in ProbLog. The corrected code should be: bb(N) :- N > 1, I in 1..N-1, pick(I, b), pick(I+1, b).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
