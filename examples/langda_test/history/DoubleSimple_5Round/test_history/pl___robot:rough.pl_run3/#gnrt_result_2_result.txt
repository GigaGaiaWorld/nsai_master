Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, we need to define two at/3 predicates for the robot's movement success and failure cases. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "8EB675E6","Code": "at(robot,NewPos,s(T)) :-\n    goto_action(T),\n    do(goto(NewPos),T,\n    goto_succeeds(T).\nat(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-\n    goto_action(T),\n    do(goto(_),T),\n    goto_fails(T),\n    at(robot,Pos,T)."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Defines the success case where the robot reaches the new position when goto succeeds
2. Defines the failure case where the robot stays in the same position when goto fails
3. Maintains consistency with the existing probability facts for goto_succeeds and goto_fails
4. Uses the existing goto_action/1 predicate to check if a movement was attempted
