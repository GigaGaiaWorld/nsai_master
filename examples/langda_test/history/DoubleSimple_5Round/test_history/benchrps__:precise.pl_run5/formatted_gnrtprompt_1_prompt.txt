System: You are a coding assistant.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Code>
in each <langda> block, <Report> shows why the <Current_Code> need to be regenerated, please regenerate the code according based on these information.

% -------------------------
% Basic rules of rock-paper-scissors
% -------------------------
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).
% -------------------------
% Calculate the result of the game
% -------------------------
% Same gestures are considered a draw
result(X, X, draw) :-
 move(X).
 
% If X beats Y, then X wins
result(X, Y, win) :-
beats(X, Y).
% If Y beats X, then X loses
result(X, Y, lose) :-
beats(Y, X).
 
% End of recursion: empty list corresponds to empty result
play([], [], []).
% Recursive advancement: take out each round of gestures, calculate the results, and continue
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
% The correct call is result(P1,P2,R), not semicolon
result(P1, P2, R),
% (Optional) Update the score according to R
play(P1T, P2T, Rs).

compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.

<HASH> Hash tag of code: CE4B5362 </HASH>
<Requirements>Main predicate: Given two player action lists P1Moves and P2Moves, calculate the winner Winner.  Firstly, call the play/3 rule to compare the two players' actions.  Then, generate a Results list containing whether each round is win, lose, or draw </Requirements></Langda>

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
</Regenerate_Instructions>
<Final_Answer>
Please regenerate the block content that needs to be regenerated according to the analysis report in JSON form, for each code block using a single problog block of the following form, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
