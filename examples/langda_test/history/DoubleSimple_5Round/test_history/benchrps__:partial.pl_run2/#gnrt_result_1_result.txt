Based on the requirements, I'll regenerate the two code blocks that need to be completed:

1. For the first <langda> block (HASH: BF964057) which requires adding "scissor" to the moves:
```problog
{"HASH": "BF964057","Code": "move(rock).\nmove(paper).\nmove(scissor)."}
```

2. For the second <langda> block (HASH: 58D60F5E) which requires adding the win-lose relationship for scissor:
```problog
{"HASH": "58D60F5E","Code": "beats(rock, scissor).\nbeats(paper, rock).\nbeats(scissor, paper)."}
```
