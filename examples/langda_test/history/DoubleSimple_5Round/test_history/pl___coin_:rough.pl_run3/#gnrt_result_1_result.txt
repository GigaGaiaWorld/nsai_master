Based on the requirements in the <langda> block, the code needs to be regenerated to properly sample CNT independent coins and accumulate the number of heads. The current code is incomplete and doesn't implement the coin tossing logic. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "DF1FDC54","Code": "PH::make_coin(C,PH).\ncoin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).\ncoins_r(SC,SC,0).\ncoins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-\n CNT > 0,\n coin(C),\n (C -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC is SC),\n CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).\ntotal(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).\nquery(total(_))."}
```

The regenerated code:
1. Keeps the same base case for coins_r/3
2. In the recursive case:
   - Samples a coin (C)
   - Checks if it's heads (using Problog's probabilistic choice)
   - Increments the head count if true
   - Decrements the counter and recurses
3. Maintains the same query structure
4. Properly accumulates the count of heads through recursion
