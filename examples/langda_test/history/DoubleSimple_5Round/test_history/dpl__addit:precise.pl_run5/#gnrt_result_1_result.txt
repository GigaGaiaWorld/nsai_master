Based on the requirements in the <Langda> block, we need to complete the `multi_addition` predicate that should parse two lists of images into numbers and add them together. Here's the regenerated code:

```problog
{"HASH": "4A9D0B2A","Code": "multi_addition(X,Y,Z) :- number(X,Xnum), number(Y,Ynum), Z is Xnum + Ynum."}
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the existing `number/2` predicate to convert both image lists to numbers
2. Adds the resulting numbers together
3. Unifies the result with Z

The query `multi_addition([img_7,img_9],[img_3,img_1,img_2],Z)` will now correctly calculate 79 + 312 = 391.
