{"HASH": "9BA21093","ErrorSummary": "The error occurs in the almost_equal predicate when handling non-ground terms in arithmetic operations. The current implementation fails when Y is not ground in the second clause.","SuggestedFix": "Modify the almost_equal predicate to handle both ground and non-ground cases properly. Replace the second clause with: almost_equal(X, Y) :- var(Y), Y =:= float(X). Also ensure all arithmetic operations in parse/2 are properly grounded before evaluation.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
