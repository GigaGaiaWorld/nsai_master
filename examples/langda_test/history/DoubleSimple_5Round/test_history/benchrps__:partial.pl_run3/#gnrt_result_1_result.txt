Based on the requirements in the <langda> blocks, here are the regenerated code snippets:

```problog
{"HASH": "BF964057", "Code": "move(scissor)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "58D60F5E", "Code": "beats(scissor, paper)."}
```

The first snippet adds the missing move 'scissor' to complete the set of possible moves in rock-paper-scissors. The second snippet adds the missing win-lose relationship showing that scissor beats paper, completing the game's rules.
