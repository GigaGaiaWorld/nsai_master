The main issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause error, which occurs because the variable 'C' in 'coin(C)' is not properly instantiated. This makes the generated code invalid. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic coin flips and accumulates the results, while the generated code fails to do so due to the mentioned error."
