  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference lies in the reformulation of the 'at(robot, Pos, s(T))' predicates, which have been reorganized but maintain the same logical conditions. The generated code is valid and correctly implements the intended probabilistic logic programming model. The running results of both codes are identical, indicating that the modifications in the generated code do not affect the program's behavior."
