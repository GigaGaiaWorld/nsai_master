  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference is in the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, where the generated code uses 'goal_reached(Prev)' instead of 'goal(Old)' to check if the previous position was the goal. This change does not affect the behavior since 'goal_reached' is defined in terms of 'goal' and 'flap_position'. The running results are identical, indicating the generated code meets expectations."
