  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to perform addition on these numbers. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, as it correctly computes the sum of two multi-digit numbers represented as lists of images. The running results are consistent with the expected behavior, demonstrating correct addition of 79 and 312 to yield 391."
