  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect. It lacks the definitions for basic stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) that were present in the original code. While it includes the sorting operation and helper predicates (get_top_n and insertion_sort), the absence of fundamental stack operations causes all queries to return 0.0000 probability, indicating failure. The generated code's structure for sorting is consistent with the original, but the missing operations make it non-functional for the given queries."
