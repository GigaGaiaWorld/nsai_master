  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference is in the naming of the 'split_list' function, which is renamed to 'split' in the generated code, but this does not affect the logic or outcome. The generated code maintains the same structure and logic as the original, ensuring the same results."
