  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The generated code has minor formatting differences, such as extra spaces and line breaks, but these do not affect the logic or execution. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected requirements."
