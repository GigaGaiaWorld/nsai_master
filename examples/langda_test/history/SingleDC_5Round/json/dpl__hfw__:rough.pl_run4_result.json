  "final_report": "The generated code is syntactically valid and follows the structure of the original code. However, it modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations by processing them in a left-associative manner without considering operator precedence, which differs from the original code's approach. This leads to different results for the same query. The original code correctly handles operator precedence (e.g., multiplication before addition), while the generated code does not, resulting in an incorrect calculation (11.666... vs -10.333...)."
