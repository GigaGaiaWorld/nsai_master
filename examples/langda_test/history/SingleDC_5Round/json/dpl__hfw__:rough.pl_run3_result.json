  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct in form but differs in implementation details from the original code. The main difference lies in the parsing logic for arithmetic operations. The original code handles subtraction by converting it into a multiplication with -1, while the generated code directly performs subtraction. This leads to different results for the same input. The generated code's result (11.666...) is incorrect compared to the original code's result (-10.333...). The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results."
