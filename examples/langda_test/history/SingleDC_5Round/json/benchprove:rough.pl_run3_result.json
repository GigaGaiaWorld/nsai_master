  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The main issue lies in the implementation of the 'implies' predicate, which in the original code checks if P is unprovable or Q is provable, whereas in the generated code it requires both P and Q to be provable. Additionally, the generated code lacks implementations for 'opposite', 'includes', 'extend', and 'refute' predicates, which are present in the original code. This leads to incorrect results for most of the queries."
