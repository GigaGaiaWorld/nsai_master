  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same logic for digit definitions, leftdigit constraints, all_different checks, and sumdigit calculations. The main predicate query_sum is also correctly implemented with the same constraints and arithmetic operations. However, the generated code introduces a variable C3 in the last sumdigit call and explicitly checks if it equals 0, which is redundant since the original code already ensures no carry by passing 0 as the output carry. Despite this minor difference, the functionality remains unchanged."
