  "final_report": "The generated code is identical to the original code in terms of functionality and structure. Both codes correctly implement the query to find countries with approximately equal population density. The generated code maintains all the predicates, facts, and queries exactly as in the original. The running results of both codes are also identical, producing the same pairs of countries with similar population densities."
