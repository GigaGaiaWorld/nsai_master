  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing identical results. The main difference is in the formatting and minor syntactic variations in the 'attempted_flap_position' rule, where the generated code uses 'goal_reached(Prev)' instead of 'goal(Old)', but this does not affect the logic or outcomes. Both codes correctly model the aircraft flap controller scenario with the same probabilities for goal achievement and overrun exceptions."
