  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. However, there is a minor issue in the 'compute_score' predicate for the 'draw' case. The original code correctly updates the score by maintaining the current score (S is S1), while the generated code incorrectly passes the tail of the list (Rs) directly without maintaining the score. Despite this, the running results of both codes are consistent for the given query."
