  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to perform addition on these numbers. This is a valid extension of the original code, which only handled single-digit additions. The generated code is consistent with the original in terms of syntax and logic but offers enhanced functionality. The running results are correct for both codes, with the generated code correctly computing the sum of 79 and 312 to get 391."
