  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. It successfully replicates the zebra puzzle solution, producing the same output as the original. The main difference is in the implementation of the 'next_to' predicate, which in the generated code is defined in terms of 'right_of', making it more concise but equally effective. Both versions correctly solve the puzzle with identical results."
