  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it modifies the parsing rules for arithmetic operations, which changes the original logic. The original code handles subtraction by converting it to addition with a negative number, while the generated code directly performs subtraction. This leads to different parsing behaviors. Second, the generated code fails to run due to a CallModeError, indicating that the 'almost_equal' predicate is not handling the arguments correctly. The original code runs successfully and produces the expected result, while the generated code does not."
