  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original functionality by introducing a 'number' predicate to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to perform addition on these numbers. The code is correct and meets the requirements, demonstrating consistency with the original code's logic while adding new capabilities. The running results are correct, showing the addition of 79 and 312 to yield 391, which is consistent with the expected behavior."
