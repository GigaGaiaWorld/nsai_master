  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The main difference is in the naming of the 'split_list' function, which is renamed to 'split' in the generated code, but the logic remains the same. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements."
