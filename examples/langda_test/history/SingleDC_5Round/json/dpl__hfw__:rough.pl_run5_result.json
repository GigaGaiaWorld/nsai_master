  "final_report": "The generated code is syntactically valid and follows the structure of the original code. However, it modifies the parsing logic for arithmetic operations, which leads to different results. The original code handles operator precedence correctly by parsing expressions recursively, while the generated code processes operations in a left-associative manner without considering operator precedence. This results in different outcomes for the same query. The generated code's result (11.666...) is incorrect compared to the original code's result (-10.333...)."
