  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. Several critical conditions in the 'carrying' and 'at' predicates have been omitted, such as checking the robot's position and key's position during pickup. This leads to incorrect probabilities in the results. The generated code's results show a much higher probability of carrying the key (0.8743 vs 0.4331) and incorrect robot positions (always at loc0 vs distributed among loc0, loc1, loc2)."
