  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. Several critical conditions in the 'carrying' predicate have been removed, such as checking the robot's position and key's position during pickup. The 'at' predicate for the robot's position has also been simplified incorrectly. These changes lead to significantly different probabilities in the results, particularly for 'carrying' and robot positions. The generated code is syntactically valid but semantically incorrect compared to the original."
