  "final_report": "The generated code is largely consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference lies in the reorganization of the 'at(robot, Pos, s(T))' clauses, which have been split into separate rules for clarity. Despite this structural change, the semantic meaning remains the same. Both codes produce identical results when executed, indicating that the generated code correctly implements the intended logic of the original code."
