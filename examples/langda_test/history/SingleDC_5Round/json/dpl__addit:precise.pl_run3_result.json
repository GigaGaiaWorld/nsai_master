  "final_report": "The generated code extends the original code's functionality by introducing a new predicate 'number' to handle multi-digit numbers and a 'multi_addition' predicate to sum these numbers. The generated code is valid and correctly implements the extended functionality. It maintains consistency with the original code's style and logic while adding new capabilities. The running results of both codes are correct for their respective queries, though they serve different purposes (single-digit vs. multi-digit addition)."
