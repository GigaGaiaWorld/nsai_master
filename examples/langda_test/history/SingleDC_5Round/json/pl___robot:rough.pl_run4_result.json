  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct as it fails to run due to a NonGroundQuery error. The main issue is in the 'at(robot,Pos,s(T))' clause where the variable 'Pos' is not properly grounded. The original code ensures proper grounding by checking the robot's position and action success, while the generated version omits these crucial checks. The generated code also simplifies the carrying rules incorrectly by removing necessary conditions."
