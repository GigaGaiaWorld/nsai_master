  "final_report": "The generated code is valid in form but produces a different result from the original code. The main difference lies in the parsing logic for expressions. The original code handles subtraction by converting it to addition with a negative number, while the generated code directly performs subtraction. This leads to different operator precedence handling, resulting in different final values (11.666... vs -10.333...). The generated code's approach is simpler but doesn't maintain the original's operator precedence rules."
