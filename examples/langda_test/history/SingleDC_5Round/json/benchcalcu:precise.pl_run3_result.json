  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes solve the same cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with identical results. However, the generated code has a minor formatting issue with the digit/1 predicates being split across lines unnecessarily. The logic in the sumdigit/5 and query_sum/1 predicates is correctly maintained, though the generated code simplifies the last sumdigit call by using an anonymous variable for the carry. This simplification does not affect the correctness of the solution."
