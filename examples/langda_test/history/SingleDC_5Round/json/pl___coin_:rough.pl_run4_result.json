  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause error, which occurs because the variable 'C' in 'coin(C)' is not properly instantiated. This makes the code invalid in Problog. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic coin flips and accumulates the results, while the generated code fails to do so due to this fundamental error."
