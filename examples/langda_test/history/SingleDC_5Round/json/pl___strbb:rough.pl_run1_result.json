  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a significant difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'between(1, N, I), I < N' instead of 'Max is N-1, between(1,Max,I)' as in the original code. This change affects the range of values I can take, leading to a different probability calculation. The generated code is valid in form but produces a different result (0.6484) compared to the original code (0.3750), indicating a logical inconsistency."
