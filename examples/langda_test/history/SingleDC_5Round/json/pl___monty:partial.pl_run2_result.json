  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem with the same probabilistic rules and queries. The generated code simplifies some conditions by using 'A \\= B' instead of 'A < B', which does not affect the outcome. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
