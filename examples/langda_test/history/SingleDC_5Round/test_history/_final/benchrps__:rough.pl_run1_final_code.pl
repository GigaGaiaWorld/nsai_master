The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It maintains the same logic for determining the outcome of rock-paper-scissors games and calculating the final winner. The main difference is the simplification of the 'outcome' predicate, which combines the three result cases (win, lose, draw) into a single predicate, making the code slightly more concise. This change does not affect the functionality or results. Both codes produce the same output for the given query.
