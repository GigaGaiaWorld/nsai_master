problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5. 

***Report:***
Validity_form:False\Validity_result:False
The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause by using 'coin(C)' without properly instantiating the variable C, which leads to an error during execution. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic coin flips and accumulates the results, while the generated code fails to do so. The generated code's structure is inconsistent with the original code's logic, particularly in how it handles the coin flips and score accumulation.
