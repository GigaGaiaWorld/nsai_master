Validity_form:True\Validity_result:True
The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes simulate flipping a biased coin (with a success probability of 0.8) four times and count the number of successes. The generated code splits the recursive cases into two separate clauses for clarity, while the original code uses a disjunction within a single clause. This structural difference does not affect the logic or the results. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence.
