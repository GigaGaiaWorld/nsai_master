The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm and produce the same sorted output for the given input. The generated code simplifies the split_list predicate into a split predicate, which is more concise but functionally equivalent. The merge and append predicates remain unchanged. The generated code meets the requirements and performs as expected.
