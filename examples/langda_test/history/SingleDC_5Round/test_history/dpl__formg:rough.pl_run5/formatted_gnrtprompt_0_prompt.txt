System: You are a coding assistant. You should use the available tools to complete the task.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 418D2062 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable merge_sort/2 algorithm </Requirements></Langda>
.
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

</Code>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here
```
</Final_Answer>


AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 418D2062 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable merge_sort/2 algorithm </Requirements></Langda>
.
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

% Base case: an empty list or a single-element list is already sorted
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).

% Recursive case: split the list into two halves, sort each, and merge the results
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    Half is Len // 2,
    split(List, Half, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).

% Split a list into two halves
split(List, Half, Left, Right) :-
    length(Left, Half),
    append(Left, Right, List).

% Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([L|Ls], [R|Rs], [L|Rest]) :-
    L =< R,
    merge(Ls, [R|Rs], Rest).
merge([L|Ls], [R|Rs], [R|Rest]) :-
    L > R,
    merge([L|Ls], Rs, Rest).

% Helper predicate for appending lists
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
    append(T, L2, R).

% Example query
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).

<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
