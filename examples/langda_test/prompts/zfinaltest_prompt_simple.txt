Please compare the following two pieces of code and judge whether the generated code meets expectations. The output is required to be strictly in the specified format.

<Original_Code>
### Original code:

{original_ruleset}

<Result>
### Run result:
{original_result}
</Result>
</Original_Code>

<Generated_Code>
### Generated code:

{generated_ruleset}

<Result>
### Run result:
{generated_result}
</Result>
</Generated_Code>

<Final_Answer>
Please return the analysis report in JSON format. The fields are as follows:
- Report: Briefly describe the correctness of the generated code, its consistency with the original code, and any problems if any(less than 200 words).
- Validity_form: Boolean value, indicating whether the generated code itself is valid and meets the requirements (true or false).
- Validity_result: Boolean value, indicating whether the running results of the two pieces of code are consistent (true or false).

Output format:
```report
{{"Report": "Fill in your analysis here...", "Validity_form": true|false,"Validity_result": true|false}}
```
