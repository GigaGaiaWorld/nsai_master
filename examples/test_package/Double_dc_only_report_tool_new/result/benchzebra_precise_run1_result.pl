/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code has several issues. First, the order of attributes in the house predicates is inconsistent with the original code, which affects readability and logical structure. For example, 'house(english, red, _, _, _)' should be 'house(red, english, _, _, _)'. Second, some terms are misplaced, such as 'snail' instead of 'snails' and 'dog' appearing in the wrong position. Despite these issues, the generated code is syntactically valid and produces a result that logically matches the original solution, identifying the correct house positions and attributes.
