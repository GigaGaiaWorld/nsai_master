/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is mostly correct but has a few issues. First, the order of attributes in the 'house' predicate is inconsistent with the original code (nationality and color are swapped). Second, 'snails' is misspelled as 'snail'. Despite these issues, the generated code produces a logically equivalent solution to the original puzzle, as evidenced by the consistent run results. The structure and logic of the constraints remain intact, leading to the same solution with attributes correctly matched.
