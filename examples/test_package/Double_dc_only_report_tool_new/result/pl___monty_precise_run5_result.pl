/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It maintains the same probabilistic logic for the Monty Hall problem, ensuring that the probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors remain unchanged (1/3 and 2/3 respectively). The generated code introduces a more structured approach with 'findall' and 'all_empty' predicates to check non-prize doors, which is a valid alternative to the original implementation. No functional discrepancies or problems were found.
