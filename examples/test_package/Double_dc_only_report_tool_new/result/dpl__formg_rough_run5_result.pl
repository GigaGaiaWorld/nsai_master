/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm in Prolog, with identical base cases, splitting logic, and merging logic. The only difference is the renaming of 'split_list' to 'split' in the generated code, which does not affect the behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list for the given input.
