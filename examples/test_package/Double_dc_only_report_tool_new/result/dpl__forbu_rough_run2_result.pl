/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct as it fails to define the 'bubble/2' predicate which is essential for the bubblesort operation. The original code defines 'bubble/3' with proper logic for sorting, while the generated code attempts to use an undefined 'bubble/2'. This inconsistency leads to a runtime error. The generated code does not meet the requirements and is not consistent with the original code's functionality.
