0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-
 
 N >= 2, Temp is N-1, between(1, Temp, I), pick(I, b), pick(I+1, b).
len(5).
evidence(palindrome(X)) :- len(X).
query(bb(X)) :- len(X).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there are two notable differences: 1) The generated code adds a condition 'N >= 2' in the 'bb' predicate, which is not present in the original code. This change is logical as it ensures the predicate only runs for valid lengths. 2) The generated code simplifies the 'bb' predicate by combining the 'II is I+1' and 'pick(II,b)' into a single 'pick(I+1, b)'. While this change is syntactically correct, it leads to a different probability result (0.6484 vs 0.3750), indicating a semantic difference in how the probabilities are calculated.
