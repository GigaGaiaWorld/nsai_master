/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct as it fails to define the 'bubble/2' predicate which is crucial for the bubblesort operation. The original code successfully implements a bubble sort with proper predicate definitions including 'hole/4', 'bubble/3', and 'swap/3'. The generated code lacks these definitions and results in an error during execution. The original code produces the correct sorted list, while the generated code cannot run due to missing clauses.
