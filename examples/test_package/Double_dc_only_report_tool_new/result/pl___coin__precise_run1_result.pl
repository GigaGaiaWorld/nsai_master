/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes simulate flipping four coins with a probability of 0.8 for heads and calculate the distribution of the number of heads. The generated code simplifies the original by separating the two cases (coin flip success and failure) into distinct clauses, making it more readable while maintaining the same probabilistic behavior.
