/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is in the 'coins_r' predicate where the syntax for the conditional statement is incorrect. The original code uses a disjunction (;) to handle both cases of the coin flip, while the generated code incorrectly uses an arrow (->) which is not valid Problog syntax. This leads to a runtime error. The generated code also fails to maintain the same probabilistic behavior as the original code.
