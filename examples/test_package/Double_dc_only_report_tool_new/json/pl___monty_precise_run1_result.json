  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem accurately, with the same probability distributions for prize selection, door opening, and winning outcomes (keep vs switch). The generated code simplifies some conditions but maintains logical equivalence. The running results are identical, showing the expected probabilities for win_keep (0.3333) and win_switch (0.6667)."
