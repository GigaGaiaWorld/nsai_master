The original code successfully implements a bubble sort with proper predicate definitions including 'hole/4', 'bubble/3', and 'swap/3'. The generated code lacks these definitions and results in an error during execution. The original code produces the correct sorted list, while the generated code cannot run due to missing clauses."
