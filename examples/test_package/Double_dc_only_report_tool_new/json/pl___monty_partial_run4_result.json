  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It simplifies the conditions in the 'open_door' rules by explicitly stating the constraints without changing the logic. The generated code maintains the same probabilistic outcomes for 'win_keep' and 'win_switch' as the original, demonstrating the Monty Hall problem correctly."
