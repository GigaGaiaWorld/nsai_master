  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It simplifies some conditions in the 'open_door' rules by explicitly stating the constraints related to the selected door and prizes, making the logic clearer. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expected outcomes."
