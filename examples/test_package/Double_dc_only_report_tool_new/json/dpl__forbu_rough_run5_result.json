  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to syntax errors in the conditional statement (->/2) which Problog cannot interpret. The original code uses a different approach with swap predicates and accumulates sorted elements differently. The generated code attempts to use a more imperative style with conditionals and append operations, which doesn't match Problog's logic programming paradigm. The running results are inconsistent as the generated code fails to execute at all."
