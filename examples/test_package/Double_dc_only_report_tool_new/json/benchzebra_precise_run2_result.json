  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and constraints, but there are some issues with the order of attributes in the house predicates. For example, the color and nationality are swapped in some predicates, and the pet and drink attributes are misplaced. Despite these inconsistencies, the generated code is valid and produces a result that is logically equivalent to the original, as both solutions correctly identify the house with the zebra and the one that drinks water."
