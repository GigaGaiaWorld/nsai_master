  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, producing the same results as the original code. It simplifies the door-opening rule by using findall to identify non-prize, non-selected doors and then randomly selecting one with a 50% probability. This approach is more concise while maintaining the same probabilistic behavior. Both codes yield identical probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors (1/3 and 2/3 respectively), demonstrating functional equivalence."
