  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. The original code uses a single recursive clause with disjunction (;) to handle both success and failure cases of coin(CNT), while the generated code separates these into two distinct clauses. This structural change does not affect the logic or the outcome, as evidenced by the identical run results. Both codes correctly model the probabilistic counting of coin flips with a success probability of 0.8."
