  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, the order of attributes in the house predicates is inconsistent with the original code, which affects readability and logical structure. Second, some predicates have incorrect attribute placements, such as 'snail' instead of 'snails' and 'dog' being in the wrong position. Despite these issues, the generated code still produces a logically consistent result that matches the original solution in terms of the relationships between the houses, though with different attribute ordering."
