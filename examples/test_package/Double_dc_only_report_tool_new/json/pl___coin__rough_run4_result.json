  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. The original code uses a single recursive clause with disjunction (;) to handle both coin success and failure cases, while the generated code splits these into two separate clauses. This structural change does not affect the logic or outcome, as evidenced by identical run results. Both versions correctly model the probabilistic coin flipping scenario and produce the same probability distribution for the total count of successful coin flips."
