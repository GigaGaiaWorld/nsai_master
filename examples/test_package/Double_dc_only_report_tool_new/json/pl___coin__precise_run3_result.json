  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to use a probabilistic 'if/3' construct which is not recognized in Problog, leading to an 'UnknownClause' error. This makes the generated code invalid as it cannot be executed. The original code correctly uses a disjunction to handle the probabilistic choice, which is the proper approach in Problog. The generated code fails to maintain consistency with the original code's logic and execution."
