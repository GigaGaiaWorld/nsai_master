  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm in Prolog, with identical logic for splitting, merging, and sorting lists. The only differences are minor syntactic variations, such as the renaming of 'split_list' to 'split' and variable names in the merge predicate, which do not affect the behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list for the given query."
