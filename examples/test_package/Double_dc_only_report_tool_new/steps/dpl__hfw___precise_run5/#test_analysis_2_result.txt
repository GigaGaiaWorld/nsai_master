# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, converts them to symbols, then parses the expression using recursive evaluation with floating-point precision handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test case evaluates the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` (represented as image inputs) which should yield `-13.666...`. The actual result shows `0.0000`, indicating a complete failure of the evaluation.

**Query and Result:**
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, 
      image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
% Result: X = 0.0000
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Main Failure Point**: The parser fails to handle operator precedence and grouping properly. The current implementation only processes operations left-to-right without considering mathematical precedence rules.

2. **Missing Predicates**: The code lacks parse rules for subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`), despite having detection predicates for these operators.

3. **Current Implementation Issue**: The only operational parse rule (hash DA5E8955) handles addition but doesn't chain operations correctly through recursion.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The parser lacks complete implementation for all four arithmetic operations and doesn't implement proper expression tree evaluation.

2. **Precision Handling**: While `almost_equal/2` is correctly implemented for floating-point comparison, it's not being effectively utilized due to parsing failures.

3. **Recursive Evaluation**: The recursive structure in `parse/2` is incomplete, failing to properly accumulate intermediate results through nested operations.

4. **Probabilistic Aspect**: The program doesn't utilize any probabilistic reasoning features of ProbLog - it's purely deterministic in its current form.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The code partially meets classical reasoning requirements but fails at complete arithmetic expression evaluation. Probabilistic reasoning and neural network integration are not utilized.

2. **Edge Cases**: The implementation doesn't handle:
   - Operator precedence
   - Negative numbers
   - Division by zero
   - Non-list inputs
   - Mixed operator expressions

3. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration features (`nn/3`, `tensor`) are used in this implementation.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing operator rules | Can't evaluate most expressions | Implement all four operation cases |
| 2 | No precedence handling | Incorrect evaluation order | Implement proper expression tree parsing |
| 3 | Recursive chain broken | Only handles simple cases | Fix recursion to accumulate results properly |
| 4 | No error handling | Crashes on invalid input | Add input validation |

**Critical Fixes Needed:**
1. Complete all four operator cases in `parse/2`
2. Implement proper precedence handling (possibly via expression tree)
3. Verify recursive evaluation chain
4. Add input validation and error cases

The current implementation requires significant revision to properly evaluate arithmetic expressions. The core detection mechanism works, but the parsing and evaluation logic needs complete restructuring to handle mathematical expressions correctly.
