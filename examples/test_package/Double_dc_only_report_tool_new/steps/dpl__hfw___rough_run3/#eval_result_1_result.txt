  "ErrorSummary": "1. Non-ground comparison in almost_equal/2 causes CallModeError during division operations. 2. Missing division by zero check. 3. Insufficient handling of floating-point precision in recursive operations.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Revise almost_equal/2 to handle both ground and non-ground cases:\n   almost_equal(X, Y) :- number(X), number(Y), abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.\n   almost_equal(X, Y) :- var(Y), number(X), Y is float(X).\n   almost_equal(X, Y) :- var(X), number(Y), X is float(Y).\n2. Add guard for division:\n   parse([N1, /, N2], R) :- N2 =\\= 0, almost_equal(R, N1 / N2).",
