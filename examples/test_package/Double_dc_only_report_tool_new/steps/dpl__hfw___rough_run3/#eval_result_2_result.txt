  "ErrorSummary": "The parse/2 predicate only handles binary operations (two numbers with one operator) and lacks support for compound expressions with multiple operations. It also doesn't implement operator precedence.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Extend parse/2 to handle compound expressions recursively with proper operator precedence (PEMDAS rules). Add new predicates like:\nparse([N1, *, N2 | T], R) :- Product is N1 * N2, parse([Product | T], R).\nparse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :- N2 =\= 0, Quotient is N1 / N2, parse([Quotient | T], R).\nparse([N1, +, N2 | T], R) :- Sum is N1 + N2, parse([Sum | T], R).\nparse([N1, -, N2 | T], R) :- Difference is N1 - N2, parse([Difference | T], R).",
