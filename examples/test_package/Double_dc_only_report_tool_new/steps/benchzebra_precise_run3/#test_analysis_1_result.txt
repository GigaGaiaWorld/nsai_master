# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires determining the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly enforced.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show one successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,fox,water,kools), 
       house(ukrainian,blue,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(english,red,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(spanish,ivory,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(japanese,green,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution correctly satisfies all puzzle constraints and returns the expected house arrangement with full probability (1.0000).

## 3. Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- `houses/1` correctly initializes the house structure
- `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` properly handle positional relationships
- `my_member/2` correctly checks for element membership
- All 15 puzzle constraints are properly enforced

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical reasoning:
1. **Classical Prolog aspects**:
   - All recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - The solution terminates as all recursive calls reduce the problem size
   - Constraints are evaluated in the correct order

2. **Probabilistic aspects**:
   - The solution returns a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic satisfaction of all constraints
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used (pure logical solution)
   - No DeepProbLog features (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in this implementation

## 5. Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the functional requirements:
- **Classical reasoning**: All constraints are correctly implemented and evaluated
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not utilized in this deterministic solution
- **Neural network integration**: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

Edge cases considered:
- House initialization properly creates exactly 5 houses
- Positional predicates handle all edge cases (first/last positions)
- All constraints are mutually satisfiable

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete. All puzzle constraints are properly enforced, and the solution matches the expected output. No errors or warnings were detected during evaluation.
