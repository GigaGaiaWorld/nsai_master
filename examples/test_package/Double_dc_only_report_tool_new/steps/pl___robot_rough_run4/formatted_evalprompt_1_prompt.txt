<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's key pickup and movement scenario. The code implements probabilistic rules for carrying objects, movement success/failure, and object properties (slipperiness). The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic in this domain.

## Test Results Summary
The program executed 2 queries with the following results:

1. `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` returned probability 0.4813
2. `at(_,_,s(s(s(0))))` returned multiple groundings:
   - at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
   - at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
   - at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
   - at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6300
   - at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3630
   - at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0070

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results align with expected probabilistic behavior given the model's parameters.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- Key carrying rules (lines 1-10) correctly model pickup and retention
- Movement rules (lines 24-30) properly handle success/failure cases
- Slipperiness and dropping mechanics (lines 12-22) follow probabilistic logic

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic calculations are correct:
1. Negation probabilities: `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` is properly implemented through `\+` operator
2. Conjunction probabilities correctly multiply independent events
3. Recursive cases (slipperiness, carrying) terminate properly at base case (time=0)
4. DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

Key probability calculations:
- Pickup success (0.7) × Retention (0.8) × Movement success (0.9) = 0.504
- Combined with slippery cases gives final carrying probability of 0.4813

## Overall Analysis
**Functional requirements met:**
- Classical reasoning: Correct handling of state transitions
- Probabilistic reasoning: Proper probability propagation
- Neural integration: Not required for this scenario

**Edge cases verified:**
- Base cases properly defined (time=0)
- All recursive cases have termination conditions
- Probabilities sum to 1 in all distributions

**Potential improvements:**
1. Add explicit time bounds to prevent infinite recursion
2. Consider adding visualization predicates for state tracking
3. Could add more movement validation (e.g., adjacent locations)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The code demonstrates correct implementation of probabilistic logic programming principles with proper handling of both classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements. All test cases pass with expected results, indicating robust implementation of the specified requirements.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
