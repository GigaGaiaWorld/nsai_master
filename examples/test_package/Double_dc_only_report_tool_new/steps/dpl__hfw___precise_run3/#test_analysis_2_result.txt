# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, then computes the result of the arithmetic expression. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and proper handling of arithmetic operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:**
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],X2) = 0.0000
```

**Test Status:** **FAILED**  
The query returned 0.0000 when it should have computed -13.6666 (2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7).

## Failure Localization
The failure occurs in the `parse/2` predicate implementation. The current code only includes:
1. A base case for single numbers (`parse([N], R)`)
2. One operation case for addition (`parse([N1, + | T], R)`)

Missing required operation cases for:
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The parser is incomplete as it doesn't handle all four required arithmetic operations.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion structure is correct but incomplete.
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.
4. **DeepProbLog Integration**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. "DeepProbLog feature not used".

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (missing operations)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Division by zero not prevented
   - Operator precedence not implemented (current is left-associative)
   - Deep recursion performance not tested

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing operation cases | Can't evaluate full expressions | Add cases for -, *, / |
| 2 | No operator precedence | Incorrect evaluation order | Implement precedence rules |
| 3 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking |
| 4 | No division by zero check | Potential runtime error | Add guard condition |

## Corrected Implementation
```prolog
parse([N1, + | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 + R2.
parse([N1, - | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 - R2.
parse([N1, * | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 * R2.
parse([N1, / | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 / R2.
```

The complete implementation requires adding the three missing operation cases shown above. With these additions, the parser should correctly evaluate all four basic arithmetic operations.
