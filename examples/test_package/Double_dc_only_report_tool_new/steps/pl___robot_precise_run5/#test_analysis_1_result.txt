# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's interaction with a key in a dynamic environment. The code implements probabilistic rules for robot movement, key pickup/drop actions, and slippery key behavior. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query probabilities at time s(s(s(0))):
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities correctly reflect:
1. The combined probabilities of successful/failed actions
2. Proper handling of negation in probabilistic contexts
3. Correct recursive time-step propagation

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates satisfy their requirements:
1. The `at/3` predicates for robot movement (lines 1-3 in first block) correctly handle movement success/failure cases
2. The `at/3` predicates for key position (lines 1-2 in second block) properly track key movement when carried
3. All probabilistic facts correctly compute using standard probability rules

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic computations are correct:
1. Negation probabilities: `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` is properly applied (e.g., in `drops/2` predicate)
2. Conjunction probabilities correctly multiply independent events
3. Recursive cases properly terminate at base case (time=0)
4. DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

Key probability calculations:
- `carrying` combines pickup success (0.7) with retention probabilities
- Robot position reflects 90% success rate of `goto` actions
- Key position probabilities properly combine robot position with carrying state

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly handles deterministic cases through logical rules
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes combined probabilities
3. **Neural network integration**: Not applicable (not used)

Edge cases handled correctly:
1. Initial conditions properly specified (time=0)
2. Recursion depth limited by time steps
3. All possible action outcomes accounted for

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the specified requirements with proper probabilistic reasoning and logical constraints. All test cases produce expected results with mathematically valid probability distributions.
