# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code should correctly sort integer lists using the insertion sort methodology. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, termination properties, and compliance with Prolog standards, while also checking for edge cases and potential issues.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorted the input list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with full certainty (probability 1.0), as expected for deterministic Prolog code.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base case (empty list)
2. Recursive case (non-empty list)
3. Insertion operation (proper element placement)

## Root Cause Analysis
The code demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical Prolog terms:

1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The `insertion_sort/2` predicate properly implements the algorithm by:
     - Recursively sorting the tail (line 2)
     - Inserting the head into the sorted tail (line 3)
   - The `insert/3` predicate correctly handles:
     - Empty list case (line 4)
     - Insertion before smaller elements (line 5)
     - Recursive insertion for larger elements (lines 6-7)

2. **Recursive Termination:**
   - The recursion terminates properly as each recursive call operates on a smaller list until reaching the base case (empty list)

3. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The result shows probability 1.0, indicating deterministic behavior
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical Prolog reasoning:

1. **Strengths:**
   - Correct implementation of insertion sort algorithm
   - Proper handling of base and recursive cases
   - Clear predicate structure

2. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - Empty list handled correctly
   - Single-element list would work implicitly
   - Already sorted lists would process efficiently

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - Could add type checking for non-integer inputs
   - Could optimize tail-recursion for very large lists
   - Could add cut operators (!) for deterministic cases
