# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code aims to recursively sort a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list with full probability (1.0000), meeting the expected behavior.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation satisfies all requirements:
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (line 2-4)
2. Correctly inserts the head element into the sorted list (lines 5-9)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:** The base case (`insertion_sort([], [])`) and recursive case are properly defined
2. **Termination:** Recursion terminates when the input list is empty
3. **Insert Operation:** The `insert_element` predicate correctly handles all insertion cases (empty list, head insertion, recursive insertion)

**ProbLog Analysis:**
1. The result shows proper probability computation (1.0000 for deterministic sorting)
2. No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this implementation
3. DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (deterministic sorting)
- Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
1. Empty list: Handled by base case
2. Single-element list: Handled through recursive base case
3. Already sorted list: Properly handled by insertion logic
4. Non-list input: Not explicitly handled (would cause type error)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add type checking for input validation
2. Consider probabilistic extensions (e.g., uncertain comparisons)
3. Add test cases for edge scenarios (duplicate elements, reverse-sorted input)
