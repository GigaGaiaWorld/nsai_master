Based on the provided `<origin_code>` and `<generated_code>`, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to each `<Langda>` block:

```problog
{"HASH": "1E127226","Code": "digit(img_4,4)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "AC3F07DC","Code": "digit(img_5,5)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "B75FE8E8","Code": "digit(img_6,6)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "FF9B3015","Code": "digit(img_8,8)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "F7977C59","Code": "digit(img_9,9)."}
```

```problog
{"HASH": "6E46AD63","Code": ""}
```

Note: 
1. The addition logic block (HASH 6E46AD63) has no corresponding implementation in the generated code
2. The generated code only contains the query line which was already present in the original code
3. All digit predicates have been formatted according to their respective hash tags and requirements
