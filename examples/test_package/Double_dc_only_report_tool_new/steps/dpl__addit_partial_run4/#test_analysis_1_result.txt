# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Digit Recognition and Addition

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to:
1. Recognize digits from image identifiers (img_1 to img_0)
2. Perform addition operations on these recognized digits
3. Answer queries about digit additions

The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, query handling, and error analysis.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.parser.ParseError: Ambiguous token role at 11:17
```

No successful queries were executed due to this parsing error. The system failed to process the `addition` predicate and consequently couldn't execute the test query `addition(img_5,img_6,Z)`.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `addition` predicate definition (line starting at position 11:17). The predicate is incomplete and malformed, causing a parsing error. The specific issues are:

1. **Incomplete Rule**: The `addition` predicate starts with `:-` but has no body defined
2. **Syntax Error**: The dangling `:-` operator without subsequent logic triggers the parser error
3. **Missing Logic**: The requirements specify addition logic for img_1 to img_0, but this is unimplemented

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. The parser cannot interpret an incomplete rule definition
2. The recursive structure for addition is missing entirely
3. No probabilistic facts or rules are properly defined for the addition operation

Probabilistic aspects:
- No probabilistic facts or rules are present in the faulty section
- The evaluation never reaches probability computation due to syntax errors

DeepProbLog features:
- "DeepProbLog feature not used" (no neural network integration present)

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements status:
1. **Digit recognition**: Partially met (individual digit facts exist)
2. **Addition logic**: Not met (parser error prevents implementation)
3. **Query handling**: Not met (cannot process queries due to error)

Edge case considerations:
- Undefined behavior for non-existent image identifiers
- No handling for invalid digit combinations
- No type checking for inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete addition predicate | Parser failure | Implement proper addition logic |
| 2 | Malformed rule syntax | Query processing impossible | Complete rule with proper body |
| 3 | Missing digit-addition mapping | Cannot perform arithmetic | Add rules like `addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A+B` |

The primary issue is the incomplete `addition` predicate definition. The solution requires:
1. Completing the addition rule with proper arithmetic
2. Ensuring all digit mappings are consistent
3. Adding proper query handling

```prolog
% Corrected addition predicate example
addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A+B.
```
