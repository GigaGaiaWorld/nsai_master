# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant chooses between three doors with one hiding a prize. The implementation should correctly model the host's behavior (opening an empty door) and calculate probabilities for winning by either keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error during parsing. The error message indicates an "Unmatched character '(' at 8:32" in the ProbLog parser. No queries could be executed successfully due to this fundamental syntax issue.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the probabilistic rule definition:
```problog
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
```

Key issues identified:
1. The rule is incomplete and malformed (line 8)
2. The subsequent code block intended to complete this rule (marked with hash E2FA63E7) was not properly integrated
3. The second rule for `open_door/1` (hash B4161B21) appears syntactically correct but cannot be evaluated due to the preceding error

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The probabilistic rule is not properly closed and contains unmatched parentheses
2. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic (from requirements) appears correct but isn't properly implemented:
   - When two empty doors exist, host should choose randomly (50/50)
   - When only one empty door exists, host must choose it (100%)
3. **Probabilistic Correctness**: The intended probability distributions (1/3 for initial prize, 0.5 for host choice) would be correct if properly implemented

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not testable due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not testable due to syntax error
   - DeepProbLog feature: Not used (correctly not included for this problem)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The implementation attempts to handle both cases (one or two empty doors)
   - List operations (`member/2`) are correctly defined
   - Recursion is properly bounded for this problem size

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unmatched parenthesis in probabilistic rule | Code cannot execute | Complete the rule syntax properly |
| 2 | Incomplete integration of code blocks | Logic not properly implemented | Merge the code blocks with proper syntax |
| 3 | Unreachable correct rules | Good logic cannot execute | Fix primary syntax error first |

**Recommendations**:
1. Fix the syntax error in the first `open_door` rule
2. Properly integrate the code blocks marked with hashes E2FA63E7 and B4161B21
3. Verify the complete implementation produces expected probabilities (1/3 for win_keep, 2/3 for win_switch)
