# Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog: Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant chooses between keeping their initial door selection or switching after the host reveals an empty door. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and ensure the implementation matches the well-known theoretical probabilities.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform 1/3 probability for the prize behind each door
2. Fixed initial selection of door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
- Prize distribution (lines 1-2)
- Door selection (line 3)
- Host behavior when two empty doors are available (lines 5-9)
- Win conditions for both strategies (lines 11-16)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. The prize distribution uses proper disjoint probabilities summing to 1
2. The host's door opening follows the specification when two empty doors are available (using A < B to avoid duplicate cases)
3. The win conditions correctly account for:
   - `win_keep`: Prize is behind initially selected door
   - `win_switch`: Prize is behind neither selected nor opened door
4. Negation (`\+`) is properly used to model "not prize" conditions

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models the game rules
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes the 1/3 vs 2/3 probabilities
3. **Edge cases**: Handles all door selection combinations properly

Potential improvements:
1. Make initial door selection configurable
2. Add validation for door numbers
3. Consider adding visualization of the decision tree

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct | 

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic outcomes. The 300-word analysis confirms the well-known probabilities emerge from the code's logical structure.
