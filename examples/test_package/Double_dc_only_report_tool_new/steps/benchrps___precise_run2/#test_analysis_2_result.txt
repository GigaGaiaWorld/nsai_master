# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The code should correctly calculate round results and determine the overall winner.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. An incomplete predicate definition (missing the closing period)
2. Malformed if-then-else construct in the logic
3. The predicate appears to be split into two parts with incorrect syntax

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/3` is correctly implemented
2. The logical relationships in `beats/2` and `result/3` are sound
3. The error is purely syntactic, not logical

Probabilistic aspects:
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct logic but syntax error prevents execution)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
- Neural network integration: Not used

Edge cases not handled:
- Non-list inputs would cause failures
- Uneven move lists would cause mismatches
- No input validation for valid moves

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Code won't compile | Add missing period and fix if-then-else syntax |
| 2 | Malformed conditional | Syntax error | Use proper Prolog conditional structure |
| 3 | Split predicate definition | Compilation failure | Combine into single properly formatted predicate |

## Corrected Code
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The evaluation reveals a syntactical error preventing proper execution, though the underlying game logic appears sound. The implementation would benefit from input validation and edge case handling.
