</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner based on sequences of moves from two players. The code should calculate round-by-round results and determine an overall winner.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with a parsing error. The error message indicates an "Ambiguous token role" at position 39:42 in the code.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which appears to be incomplete in the provided code. The predicate definition is cut off mid-implementation (after the `:-` operator) without any body rules defined.

Key problematic sections:
1. Line 39: Incomplete predicate definition `determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :-` (missing implementation)
2. The parser error occurs because of this incomplete definition

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: 
   - The base rules for moves and beats relationships are correctly defined
   - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are logically sound
   - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates scores

2. **Recursive Termination**:
   - Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - Recursion terminates correctly for empty lists

3. **Missing Implementation**:
   - The main predicate `determine_winner/3` is not fully implemented
   - There's no connection between playing the rounds and computing the final score

4. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Basic move comparison and round result calculation works
   - Score computation from results works
   - Final winner determination is not implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Uneven move lists (different lengths) would cause issues
   - Invalid moves would not be properly validated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete `determine_winner/3` predicate | Cannot determine final winner | Complete the predicate implementation |
| 2 | No input validation | Invalid moves would cause errors | Add move validation checks |
| 3 | No handling for uneven move lists | Would cause recursion errors | Add length check at start |

```prolog
% Suggested completion for determine_winner/3
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1;
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2;
     Winner = draw).
```

The main issue is the incomplete implementation of the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which prevents the code from fulfilling its primary requirement. The core game logic is otherwise sound but needs proper integration with the scoring system to produce a final result.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
