# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner based on sequences of moves from two players. The code should calculate round-by-round results and determine an overall winner.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with a parsing error. The error message indicates an "Ambiguous token role" at position 39:42 in the code.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which appears to be incomplete in the provided code. The predicate definition is cut off mid-implementation (after the `:-` operator) without any body rules defined.

Key problematic sections:
1. Line 39: Incomplete predicate definition `determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :-` (missing implementation)
2. The parser error occurs because of this incomplete definition

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: 
   - The base rules for moves and beats relationships are correctly defined
   - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are logically sound
   - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates scores

2. **Recursive Termination**:
   - Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - Recursion terminates correctly for empty lists

3. **Missing Implementation**:
   - The main predicate `determine_winner/3` is not fully implemented
   - There's no connection between playing the rounds and computing the final score

4. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Basic move comparison and round result calculation works
   - Score computation from results works
   - Final winner determination is not implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Uneven move lists (different lengths) would cause issues
   - Invalid moves would not be properly validated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete `determine_winner/3` predicate | Cannot determine final winner | Complete the predicate implementation |
| 2 | No input validation | Invalid moves would cause errors | Add move validation checks |
| 3 | No handling for uneven move lists | Would cause recursion errors | Add length check at start |

```prolog
% Suggested completion for determine_winner/3
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1;
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2;
     Winner = draw).
```

The main issue is the incomplete implementation of the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which prevents the code from fulfilling its primary requirement. The core game logic is otherwise sound but needs proper integration with the scoring system to produce a final result.
