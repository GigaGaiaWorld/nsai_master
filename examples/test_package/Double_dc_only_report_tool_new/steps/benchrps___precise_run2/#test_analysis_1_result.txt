# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning aspects. The code defines game rules, calculates round results, computes scores, and determines the overall winner between two players.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
No other test queries were provided, so we cannot verify additional cases.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. An incomplete predicate definition before the final version
2. A syntax error in the if-then-else construct (`->/2` operator)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog:
1. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented
2. The logical relationships between moves are properly defined
3. The error is purely syntactic, not logical

Probabilistic aspects:
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct logic but syntax error prevents execution)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
- Neural network integration: Not used

Edge cases not handled:
1. Non-list inputs to `play/3` or `compute_score/2`
2. Lists of unequal length
3. Invalid moves (non-rock/paper/scissor inputs)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition before final version | Compilation error | Remove the partial definition |
| 2 | Syntax error in if-then-else construct | Execution failure | Ensure proper operator usage |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation checks |
| 4 | No handling for unequal list lengths | Incorrect results | Add length check predicate |

## Corrected Code
```prolog
% Remove the incomplete predicate definition
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- % DELETE THIS LINE

% Keep only the complete version
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The evaluation reveals a correct logical structure for the rock-paper-scissors game implementation, but a syntax error prevents successful execution. After fixing the syntax issues and adding input validation, the implementation would meet classical reasoning requirements.
