# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate a series of coin tosses. The program should track the number of successful heads outcomes (SC) as it counts down from an initial value (CNT=4) to zero. The evaluation focuses on verifying the program's logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and handling of recursive operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'if/3' at 7:4.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the recursive rule `coins_r/3` (lines 7-14) when attempting to use the undefined predicate `if/3`. The problematic code block is:
```prolog
P::if(coin(CNT),
        (NewSC is SC + 1,
         NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT)),
        (NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(SC,S,NewCNT)))
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The program fails because ProbLog doesn't have a built-in `if/3` predicate. The intended conditional logic needs to be implemented differently.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: The program attempts to use probabilistic implication incorrectly. The proper approach would be to use ProbLog's built-in probabilistic constructs.
3. **Recursive Termination**: The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined, but the recursive case fails before reaching termination.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not met due to undefined predicate
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not properly implemented
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The undefined `if/3` predicate breaks all functionality
   - No handling for negative CNT values
   - No validation for probability bounds (0.8 coin bias)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `if/3` predicate | Complete failure | Replace with ProbLog's `probabilistic_if/1` or use separate clauses |
| 2 | Incorrect probabilistic syntax | Invalid probability handling | Use `P::heads :- coin(C)` style declarations |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add guards for CNT > 0 in recursive case |

**Recommendations**:
1. Replace the `if/3` construct with proper ProbLog conditional syntax
2. Separate the probabilistic facts from the recursive logic
3. Consider using `probabilistic_if/1` or explicit case handling
4. Add input validation for the counter parameter

The corrected version should properly model the coin toss scenario while maintaining ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning capabilities. The current implementation fails before any meaningful computation can occur due to the undefined predicate.
