    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'if/3' at 7:4.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate a series of coin tosses. The program should track the number of successful heads outcomes (SC) as it counts down from an initial value (CNT=4) to zero. The evaluation focuses on verifying the program's logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and handling of recursive operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'if/3' at 7:4.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the recursive rule `coins_r/3` (lines 7-14) when attempting to use the undefined predicate `if/3`. The problematic code block is:
```prolog
P::if(coin(CNT),
        (NewSC is SC + 1,
         NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT)),
        (NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(SC,S,NewCNT)))
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The program fails because ProbLog doesn't have a built-in `if/3` predicate. The intended conditional logic needs to be implemented differently.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: The program attempts to use probabilistic implication incorrectly. The proper approach would be to use ProbLog's built-in probabilistic constructs.
3. **Recursive Termination**: The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined, but the recursive case fails before reaching termination.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not met due to undefined predicate
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not properly implemented
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The undefined `if/3` predicate breaks all functionality
   - No handling for negative CNT values
   - No validation for probability bounds (0.8 coin bias)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `if/3` predicate | Complete failure | Replace with ProbLog's `probabilistic_if/1` or use separate clauses |
| 2 | Incorrect probabilistic syntax | Invalid probability handling | Use `P::heads :- coin(C)` style declarations |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add guards for CNT > 0 in recursive case |

**Recommendations**:
1. Replace the `if/3` construct with proper ProbLog conditional syntax
2. Separate the probabilistic facts from the recursive logic
3. Consider using `probabilistic_if/1` or explicit case handling
4. Add input validation for the counter parameter

The corrected version should properly model the coin toss scenario while maintaining ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning capabilities. The current implementation fails before any meaningful computation can occur due to the undefined predicate.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
