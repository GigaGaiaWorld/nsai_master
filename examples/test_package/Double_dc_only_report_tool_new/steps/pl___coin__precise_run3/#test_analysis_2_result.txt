# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Program

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses and count successful outcomes. The program uses probabilistic facts and recursive rules to model a series of coin flips, where each coin has an 80% probability of landing heads. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and proper implementation of recursive termination.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16
```
No successful queries were executed due to this compilation error. The program failed before any probabilistic computations could be performed.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate (lines 8-16) where the if-then-else construct (`->/2`) is improperly implemented. ProbLog requires special syntax for conditional statements that differs from standard Prolog.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The recursive logic is conceptually correct (decrementing counter, accumulating successes), but the implementation is syntactically invalid in ProbLog.
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The program fails before reaching any probability calculations, but the `coin/1` fact definition (line 2) is correctly specified.
3. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is present in this code ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not reached due to compilation failure
   - Neural integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The recursive termination condition (`CNT > 0`) is properly specified
   - No list handling required in this implementation
   - Recursion depth is controlled by the counter parameter

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid if-then-else syntax in ProbLog | Compilation failure | Replace with `probabilistic_if/3` or proper ProbLog conditional |
| 2 | Missing proper ProbLog conditional handling | Prevents execution | Implement using `P::if(Cond,Then,Else)` syntax |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).

coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    P::if(coin(CNT),
        (NewSC is SC + 1,
         NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT)),
        (NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(SC,S,NewCNT))).

total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).
```

The main issue stems from attempting to use standard Prolog conditionals in ProbLog, which requires special probabilistic conditional handling. The corrected version uses ProbLog's proper conditional syntax while maintaining the same logical flow.
