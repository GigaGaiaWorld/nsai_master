# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must satisfy digit constraints, uniqueness, and proper addition with carry propagation. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, requirement compliance, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 10 successful solutions:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies:
1. First-digit constraints via `leftdigit/1`
2. Unique digit assignments via `all_different/1`
3. Correct addition with carry via `sumdigit/5`

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. All expansion predicates (`digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and functionally verified.

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Aspects
- **Logical Correctness**: The solution correctly models the puzzle constraints:
  ```prolog
  sumdigit(Cin, A, B, Sum, Cout) :- 
    X is Cin + A + B,
    ( X < 10, Sum = X, Cout = 0 ; X >= 10, Sum is X - 10, Cout = 1 ).
  ```
- **Termination**: Recursion in `all_different/1` terminates as list length decreases with each call.

### Probabilistic Aspects
- All solutions show probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic reasoning. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.

### DeepProbLog Integration
**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) appear in the code.

## Overall Analysis
### Requirement Compliance
| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Digit constraints | ✔ |
| Unique assignments | ✔ |
| Carry propagation | ✔ |
| Probabilistic reasoning | ✖ (Not required) |
| Neural integration | ✖ (Not required) |

### Edge Cases
1. **Undefined Inputs**: Handled by `digit/1` constraints
2. **Non-list Input**: Not applicable (query format enforces list)
3. **Deep Recursion**: Maximum recursion depth is 5 (`[A,B,C,D,E]`), posing no performance risk

The implementation fully meets the specified cryptarithmetic puzzle requirements with robust constraint handling. For extended functionality, probabilistic facts or neural components could be incorporated in future iterations.
