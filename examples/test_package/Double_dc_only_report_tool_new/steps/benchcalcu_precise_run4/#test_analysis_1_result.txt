# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The code should satisfy three key requirements: proper digit constraints, uniqueness of digit assignments, and correct arithmetic with carry propagation.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a `CallModeError` in the `sumdigit/5` predicate. The error occurs when trying to evaluate arithmetic expressions with ungrounded variables.

## Failure Localization
- **Failed Query**: `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`
- **Error Location**: Line 23 (in `sumdigit/5` predicate)
- **Error Type**: `CallModeError` - Invalid argument types for 'is/2'
- **Problem**: The arithmetic expression `X is Cin + A + B` fails because `A` and `B` are uninstantiated variables when the evaluation occurs.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Flow Issue**: The evaluation order is incorrect. The code attempts arithmetic operations before variables are bound to specific digits.
2. **Classical Prolog Issue**: The `is/2` operator requires its right-hand side to be ground (fully instantiated) when evaluated.
3. **Missing Digit Generation**: The code doesn't first generate possible digit values before attempting arithmetic operations.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct structure but execution fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Uninstantiated variables in arithmetic operations
   - Missing digit generation before constraint checking
   - No handling of multiple solutions (though puzzle should have unique solution)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Ungrounded variables in arithmetic | Execution failure | Restructure to generate digits first |
| 2 | Incorrect evaluation order | Logical flow broken | Reorder constraints to bind variables first |
| 3 | Missing digit instantiation | No solutions generated | Add digit selection before arithmetic |

## Corrected Approach
The code should be restructured to:
1. First select digits for each letter
2. Then apply the constraints
3. Finally perform arithmetic checks

```prolog
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
    leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C),
    digit(D), digit(E),
    all_different([A,B,C,D,E]),
    sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Carry1),
    sumdigit(Carry1, A, C, D, Carry2),
    sumdigit(Carry2, 0, B, C, _).
```

This ensures variables are instantiated before arithmetic operations. The puzzle should then correctly yield the unique solution (A=9, B=2, C=1, D=3, E=5) corresponding to 92 + 213 = 315.
