# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that models coin flipping with probabilistic outcomes. The code implements a recursive counter that tracks successful "heads" outcomes across multiple coin flips, with each coin having an independent probability of 0.8 for heads.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 successes (heads) when flipping 4 coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly follow the binomial distribution for n=4 trials with p=0.8 success probability:
- P(4) = 0.8⁴ = 0.4096
- P(3) = 4 × 0.8³ × 0.2 = 0.4096
- P(2) = 6 × 0.8² × 0.2² = 0.1536
- P(1) = 4 × 0.8 × 0.2³ = 0.0256
- P(0) = 0.2⁴ = 0.0016

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly handles:
1. Base case termination (CNT=0)
2. Probabilistic coin flip outcomes
3. Success count accumulation

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly handles:
1. **Logical correctness**: The recursion properly decrements CNT until reaching 0
2. **Probabilistic rules**: 
   - Each `coin(CNT)` has P=0.8
   - Negation `\+ coin(CNT)` correctly computes P=0.2
3. **Probability computation**: Joint probabilities are correctly multiplied through recursive cases

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - The implementation uses only basic ProbLog features without neural network integration.

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correct recursive logic
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper probability computation
3. **Edge cases**: 
   - Handles all CNT values down to 0
   - Properly accumulates successes
   - Correct probability distribution

Potential improvements:
1. Could parameterize the coin probability
2. Could add input validation for CNT
