    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a probabilistic success rate. The program should count successful outcomes (heads) from multiple coin tosses, where each coin has an 80% probability of landing heads. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and proper recursive implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16
```
No queries were successfully executed due to this compilation error. The program failed before producing any probability results.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate (lines 8-16) where the if-then-else construct (`->/2`) is improperly implemented. ProbLog requires special handling of conditional statements compared to standard Prolog.

Problematic code block:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT) ->       % Line 8 - Error occurs here
        NewSC is SC + 1,
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT)
    ;
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT)
    ).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The recursive logic is conceptually correct (decrementing counter and accumulating successes), but the implementation violates ProbLog syntax rules.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: The program attempts to use standard Prolog's if-then-else in a ProbLog context where probabilistic conditionals require different handling.
3. **Termination**: The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined, but the recursive case fails before execution.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but non-functional
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not properly implemented due to syntax error
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The counter decrementing logic properly handles termination
   - No protection against negative counter values
   - Probabilistic fact definition (`coin(C)`) is correct but unused

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid if-then-else syntax in ProbLog | Complete failure | Replace with `probabilistic_if/3` or restructure as separate clauses |
| 2 | No handling of negative counter values | Potential future issues | Add guard clause `CNT >= 0` |
| 3 | Unused probabilistic fact | Wasted definition | Ensure `coin(C)` is properly utilized |

## Recommended Fix
The code should be restructured to avoid the if-then-else construct. Here's a corrected version:

```prolog
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    coin(CNT),
    NewSC is SC + 1,
    coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    \+ coin(CNT),
    coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT).
```

This solution properly separates the probabilistic cases while maintaining the same logical flow and complying with ProbLog syntax requirements.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
