# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a probabilistic success rate. The program should count successful outcomes (heads) from multiple coin tosses, where each coin has an 80% probability of landing heads. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and proper recursive implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16
```
No queries were successfully executed due to this compilation error. The program failed before producing any probability results.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate (lines 8-16) where the if-then-else construct (`->/2`) is improperly implemented. ProbLog requires special handling of conditional statements compared to standard Prolog.

Problematic code block:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT) ->       % Line 8 - Error occurs here
        NewSC is SC + 1,
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT)
    ;
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT)
    ).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The recursive logic is conceptually correct (decrementing counter and accumulating successes), but the implementation violates ProbLog syntax rules.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: The program attempts to use standard Prolog's if-then-else in a ProbLog context where probabilistic conditionals require different handling.
3. **Termination**: The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined, but the recursive case fails before execution.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but non-functional
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not properly implemented due to syntax error
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The counter decrementing logic properly handles termination
   - No protection against negative counter values
   - Probabilistic fact definition (`coin(C)`) is correct but unused

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid if-then-else syntax in ProbLog | Complete failure | Replace with `probabilistic_if/3` or restructure as separate clauses |
| 2 | No handling of negative counter values | Potential future issues | Add guard clause `CNT >= 0` |
| 3 | Unused probabilistic fact | Wasted definition | Ensure `coin(C)` is properly utilized |

## Recommended Fix
The code should be restructured to avoid the if-then-else construct. Here's a corrected version:

```prolog
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    coin(CNT),
    NewSC is SC + 1,
    coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    \+ coin(CNT),
    coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT).
```

This solution properly separates the probabilistic cases while maintaining the same logical flow and complying with ProbLog syntax requirements.
