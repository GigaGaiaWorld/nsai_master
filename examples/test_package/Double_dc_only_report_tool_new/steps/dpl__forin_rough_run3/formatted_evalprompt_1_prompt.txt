</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the `insertion_sort/2` predicate and its helper predicate `insert/3` in both classical and probabilistic contexts (though no probabilistic features are used here). The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
Result:
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with probability 1.0000, as expected.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base case (empty list)
2. Recursive case (non-empty list)
3. Insert operation with both cases (X ≤ Y and X > Y)

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm follows standard insertion sort logic:
   - Line 1: Base case correctly returns empty list
   - Lines 2-3: Recursively sorts tail and inserts head
   - Lines 4-6: Insert predicate correctly places elements in order

2. **Recursive Termination**: 
   - The recursion terminates properly as each call reduces the list size
   - All clauses are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive

### ProbLog Analysis
1. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
2. The probability 1.0000 indicates deterministic behavior
3. **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met - correct sorting implementation
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features used)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable

### Edge Case Considerations
1. **Non-list input**: Not handled (would cause type errors)
2. **Empty list**: Correctly handled
3. **Already sorted list**: Correctly handled
4. **Duplicate elements**: Correctly handled (preserves duplicates)
5. **Deep recursion**: No stack overflow protection for very long lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on non-list inputs | Add type checking |
| 2 | No stack overflow protection | May fail on very long lists | Consider iterative implementation |
| 3 | No probabilistic features used | Limited to deterministic sorting | Could extend with probabilistic comparisons |

**Word Count**: 398

The implementation correctly performs insertion sort for the tested case and appears logically sound for standard use cases. The main areas for improvement would be input validation and handling of edge cases, particularly for non-list inputs and extremely long lists.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
