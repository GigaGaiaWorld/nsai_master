# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a player selects a door, the host (Monty) opens another door revealing no prize, and the player can choose to keep their initial selection or switch. The implementation should correctly calculate the probabilities of winning when keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All test results match the expected probabilities for the Monty Hall problem:
- Equal 1/3 probability for the prize behind each door
- 1/3 probability of winning when keeping the initial choice
- 2/3 probability of winning when switching doors

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic behavior.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The `open_door/1` predicate correctly handles both scenarios:
1. When two non-prize, non-selected doors are available (random selection with 0.5 probability)
2. When only one non-prize, non-selected door is available (deterministic opening)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation satisfies all probabilistic requirements:
1. The prize distribution is correctly modeled with `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)`
2. The player's initial selection is fixed with `select_door(1)`
3. The `open_door/1` predicate correctly implements the host's behavior:
   - Uses probabilistic choice (0.5::open_door(D)) when two options exist
   - Uses deterministic choice when only one option exists
4. The win conditions properly account for:
   - `win_keep`: Prize is behind initially selected door
   - `win_switch`: Prize is behind neither selected nor opened door

Probabilistic rules are correctly implemented:
- `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is handled through negation as failure
- No implications are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the functional requirements:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models the game rules
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately calculates the probabilities
- **Edge cases**: Properly handles all door selection scenarios

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. Non-list input to `member/2` (currently not protected)
2. Extension to N-doors scenario (current implementation is hardcoded for 3 doors)
3. Variable player selection (currently fixed to door 1)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with appropriate probabilistic reasoning and produces the expected results for all test cases. No errors were found in the current implementation.
