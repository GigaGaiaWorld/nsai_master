# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door, and the contestant decides whether to keep their original choice or switch. The implementation should demonstrate the known probability distribution where switching doors yields a 2/3 chance of winning.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All test cases passed successfully. The probabilities match the expected theoretical values:
- Equal 1/3 probability for each door having the prize
- 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the original choice
- 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly handles:
1. Random prize placement (lines 1-2)
2. Door selection (line 3)
3. Host behavior rules (lines 5-15)
4. Winning conditions (lines 17-22)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
1. Prize distribution: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for each door
2. Host behavior:
   - When both remaining doors are empty: `P(open_door(A)) = 0.5` (random selection)
   - When one remaining door has prize: `P(open_door(empty)) = 1` (deterministic)
3. Winning probabilities:
   - `P(win_keep) = P(prize(selected)) = 1/3`
   - `P(win_switch) = 1 - P(win_keep) = 2/3`

The code properly handles all edge cases:
- All possible prize locations
- All possible door selections
- All possible host actions

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
1. Classical reasoning (correct logical relationships between doors)
2. Probabilistic reasoning (correct probability distributions)
3. Edge cases (all possible game scenarios are covered)

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete, demonstrating proper understanding and application of ProbLog for modeling the Monty Hall problem. All test cases pass with expected probabilities, and the code structure clearly represents the problem's logical and probabilistic aspects.
