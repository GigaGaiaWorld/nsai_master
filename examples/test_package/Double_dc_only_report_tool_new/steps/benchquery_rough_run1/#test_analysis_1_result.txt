# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program calculates population density from given population and area facts, then finds country pairs meeting the density similarity criteria.

## Test Results Summary
All test cases passed successfully. The program returned exactly 4 country pairs with density ratios between 0.95 and 1.05:

1. `query_pop([china, 244.0828402366864, france, 246.4788732394366]) = 1.0000`
2. `query_pop([indonesia, 223.859649122807, pakistan, 219.2926045016077]) = 1.0000`
3. `query_pop([italy, 477.58620689655174, philippines, 461.1111111111111]) = 1.0000`
4. `query_pop([ethiopia, 77.71428571428571, mexico, 76.04712041884817]) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures) because:
- Density calculations match manual verification
- Country pairs satisfy the 5% density ratio requirement
- No duplicate or invalid pairs were returned

## Failure Localization
Not applicable - all test cases passed successfully. The following components were verified:
- `density/2` predicate (lines 1-3) correctly computes density
- `query_pop/1` predicate (lines 4-6) properly filters pairs
- All expansion predicates are correctly defined (though none were explicitly used)

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:

1. **Logical Correctness**:
   ```prolog
   density(Country, Density) :- 
       pop(Country, Pop), 
       area(Country, Area), 
       Density is (Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000).
   ```
   The density calculation correctly handles unit conversions (population in 100,000s and area in 1,000 sq miles).

2. **Query Predicate**:
   ```prolog
   query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :- 
       density(Country1, Density1), 
       density(Country2, Density2), 
       Country1 @< Country2, 
       Ratio is Density1 / Density2, 
       Ratio >= 0.95, 
       Ratio =< 1.05.
   ```
   The comparison ensures no duplicate pairs (A-B vs B-A) and maintains the 5% density ratio constraint.

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules were used (all deterministic)
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required/used in this solution
- Neural network integration: Not used (not required)

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Unit conversion in density calculation
2. Alphabetical ordering prevents duplicate pairs
3. Ratio bounds (0.95-1.05) properly implemented
4. All country data appears complete

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for non-list queries
2. Consider adding probabilistic population estimates
3. Could extend to find all pairs within N% difference
