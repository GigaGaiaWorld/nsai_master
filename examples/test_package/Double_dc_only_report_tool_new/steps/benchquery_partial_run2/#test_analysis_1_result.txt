# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Prolog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided population and area data, then finds country pairs where one density is slightly higher than another (within a 5% margin).

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful queries:
```
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All queries returned expected results with probability 1.0, correctly identifying country pairs with similar population densities according to the specified criteria.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The following components were verified:
- `density/2` predicate (lines 12-15) correctly calculates density
- `query_pop/1` predicate (lines 6-11) properly implements the comparison logic
- All population and area facts are correctly defined

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical correctness**: The density calculation `D is (P*100)//A` and comparison logic `T1 is 20*D1, T2 is 21*D2, T1 < T2` are mathematically sound
2. **Termination**: The program terminates as it uses finite facts and non-recursive rules
3. **Probabilistic aspects**: Not applicable (pure Prolog program)
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional requirements met:**
- Classical reasoning fully implemented
- Probabilistic reasoning not required
- Neural network integration not required

**Edge cases considered:**
1. Integer division in density calculation may cause precision loss (acceptable for this use case)
2. No handling for countries with zero area (not present in dataset)
3. All input data is properly typed and validated

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

**Code quality observations:**
1. The population/area data is complete and accurate
2. The comparison logic effectively finds similarly dense countries
3. Consider adding comments explaining the 20/21 ratio in the comparison logic
4. Could be extended with probabilistic facts for uncertainty handling
