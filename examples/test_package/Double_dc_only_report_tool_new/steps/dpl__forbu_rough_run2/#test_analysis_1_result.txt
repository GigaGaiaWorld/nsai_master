# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its functionality and identifying any issues in the implementation. The code was tested with a query to sort the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`, but resulted in an error during execution.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:14
```

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate at line 4, specifically with the conditional operator `->/2`. The Prolog interpreter cannot find the implementation for this operator in the current context.

**Problematic Code Section:**
```prolog
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L1),
    (L == L1 ->          % Line 4: Error occurs here
        append(Acc, L, Sorted)
    ; 
        append(Acc, [H|_], NewAcc),
        bubblesort(L1, NewAcc, Sorted)
    ).
```

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue stems from using the conditional operator `->/2` in a context where it's not properly supported. In standard Prolog, this operator is available, but the error suggests the code is being evaluated in a ProbLog environment that doesn't recognize this syntax.

Key problems identified:
1. The conditional operator `->/2` is not properly implemented in the ProbLog environment
2. The recursive logic appears correct, but cannot be tested due to the syntax error
3. The base case and recursive cases are properly defined but inaccessible

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Not fully met due to syntax error
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements in code)
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Not Handled:**
- Non-list input would cause type errors
- Deep recursion could cause stack overflow for very large lists
- Empty list case is properly handled by the base case

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Conditional operator `->/2` not recognized | Prevents entire program from running | Rewrite using `if-then-else` construct or separate predicates |
| 2 | ProbLog environment mismatch | Code designed for standard Prolog | Either adapt code for ProbLog or run in standard Prolog environment |
| 3 | Potential performance issues | Not testable due to main error | Consider adding tail recursion optimization |

**Recommended Fix:**
```prolog
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L1),
    (L == L1 
        -> append(Acc, L, Sorted)
        ;  append(Acc, [H|_], NewAcc),
           bubblesort(L1, NewAcc, Sorted)
    ).
```

The code needs to be either:
1. Modified to use ProbLog-compatible syntax, or
2. Run in a standard Prolog environment where the conditional operator is supported

The bubblesort logic itself appears correct, but cannot be properly evaluated until the syntax issue is resolved. The implementation follows the standard bubblesort approach with proper base cases and recursive decomposition.
