           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubble/2' at 1:31.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically examining the `bubblesort/3` predicate and its supporting predicates. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, error handling, and compliance with Prolog programming standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test case `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))` failed with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubble/2' at 1:31
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`
   - **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (line 1, position 31)
   - **Root Cause**: Missing implementation of the `bubble/2` predicate which is called by `bubblesort/3`
   - **Code Segment**:
     ```prolog
     bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :- bubble(L, L1), ...
     ```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Analysis**:
   - The implementation is incomplete as it references an undefined predicate `bubble/2`
   - The recursive structure appears logically correct but cannot execute without the base `bubble/2` operation
   - No termination issues are apparent in the visible code structure

2. **ProbLog Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are present in the implementation
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) are used
   - The error is purely syntactic/semantic in classical Prolog terms

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Compliance**:
   - **Not Met**: The implementation fails to provide a complete, working bubblesort algorithm
   - The missing `bubble/2` predicate is essential for the sorting operation

2. **Edge Case Considerations**:
   - Non-list inputs would cause additional errors
   - Empty list handling cannot be verified without complete implementation
   - Performance with large lists cannot be assessed

3. **Code Quality Observations**:
   - The recursive approach is conceptually correct
   - The accumulator pattern is appropriately used
   - Missing base case implementation prevents execution

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `bubble/2` predicate | Complete failure of sorting functionality | Implement the bubble operation that performs single pass sorting |
| 2 | No base case handling | Potential infinite recursion if bubble operation doesn't reduce list | Add explicit base case for empty/single-element lists |
| 3 | No input validation | Will fail on non-list inputs | Add type checking for list inputs |

**Recommendation**: Implement the missing `bubble/2` predicate to complete the bubblesort algorithm. A suggested implementation would be:

```prolog
bubble([X,Y|T], [Y|Rest]) :- X > Y, bubble([X|T], Rest).
bubble([X,Y|T], [X|Rest]) :- X =< Y, bubble([Y|T], Rest).
bubble([X], [X]).
bubble([], []).
```

The complete implementation should then be retested with various input cases including edge conditions (empty list, already sorted list, reverse-sorted list).

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
