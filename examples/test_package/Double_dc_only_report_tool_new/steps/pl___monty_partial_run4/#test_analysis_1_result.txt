# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models the scenario where a contestant selects a door (always door 1 in this implementation), the host opens another door following specific rules, and calculates the probabilities of winning by either keeping the original choice or switching doors.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Equal 1/3 probability for the prize behind each door
2. Certainty of selecting door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the original choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates correctly implement the Monty Hall problem logic:
1. `open_door/1` rules correctly handle both scenarios (when both remaining doors are empty and when one has a prize)
2. `win_keep/0` and `win_switch/0` correctly calculate the winning conditions
3. Probability distributions match expected theoretical values

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
1. The initial prize distribution: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for each door
2. The negation in `\+ prize(A)` correctly computes `1 - P(prize(A))`
3. The host's door opening strategy follows the problem's requirements:
   - When both remaining doors are empty, opens one randomly (50/50)
   - When one remaining door has a prize, always opens the empty one
4. The winning probabilities correctly reflect the known solution to the Monty Hall problem

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly implements the logical rules of the game
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes the probability distributions
3. **Edge cases**: Handles all possible door configurations correctly

Potential edge cases that were considered:
1. The fixed initial selection (door 1) doesn't affect the general solution due to problem symmetry
2. The `member/2` predicate correctly enumerates all door possibilities
3. The constraints ensure the host never opens the selected door or a door with a prize

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probability calculations and proper handling of all game scenarios. No errors or improvements were identified in the current implementation.
