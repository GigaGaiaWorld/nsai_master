# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, converts them to symbols, then parses the expression to compute results with floating-point precision using `almost_equal/2`.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
- Query: `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)`
- Error: CallModeError for `</2` with non-ground arguments in `almost_equal/2`

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `almost_equal/2` predicate when processing complex expressions:
1. **Error Location**: Line 24 (in the parse rules for arithmetic operations)
2. **Failing Predicate**: `almost_equal(R, N1 * R2)` (and similar for other operations)
3. **Root Cause**: The comparison `abs(X - Y) < 0.0001` requires both arguments to be ground, but during recursive parsing, `Y` (the expected result) becomes uninstantiated.

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Issues
1. **Logical Correctness**: The parsing logic is correct in principle but fails due to evaluation order
2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion is properly structured but fails before completion
3. **Groundness Check**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate doesn't properly handle cases where both arguments might be uninstantiated during computation

### Probabilistic Aspects
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog features are not utilized (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls)

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
- Basic expression parsing is partially implemented
- Image-to-symbol conversion works correctly
- Floating-point comparison logic is conceptually sound

### Edge Cases Missed
1. Non-ground expressions during intermediate computation
2. Division by zero cases not handled
3. No input validation for malformed expressions
4. No support for parentheses or operator precedence

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground comparison in almost_equal | Prevents expression evaluation | Restructure to compute first, then compare |
| 2 | No operator precedence handling | Incorrect evaluation order | Implement proper precedence rules |
| 3 | No division by zero check | Potential runtime error | Add validation predicate |
| 4 | No input validation | May crash on bad inputs | Add type checking predicates |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Revised almost_equal/2 predicate
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), ground(Y), 
    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(Y), 
    Y is float(X).
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(X), 
    X is float(Y).

% Revised parse rules to compute first
parse([N1,+|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    R is N1 + R2.
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    R is N1 - R2.
parse([N1,*|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    R is N1 * R2.
parse([N1,/|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    R2 =\= 0,
    R is N1 / R2.
```

The revised version separates the computation and comparison phases, properly handles groundness issues, and adds basic safety checks. The evaluation should then work as expected for well-formed arithmetic expressions.
