</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorted the input list with a probability of 1.0, as expected for deterministic sorting operations in classical Prolog.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation:
1. Correctly handles the base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`)
2. Properly implements the recursive case by:
   - Sorting the tail (line 3-4)
   - Inserting the head element (lines 6-11)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- The recursion terminates properly as each call reduces the list size
- The `insert_element/3` predicate correctly maintains the sorted order through:
  - Base case insertion (line 6)
  - Proper element placement (lines 7-8 for insertion before head, lines 9-11 for recursive insertion)

**ProbLog Analysis:**
- The implementation uses no probabilistic facts or rules
- All results show probability 1.0, indicating deterministic behavior
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration present)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts/rules)
3. Neural network integration: Not present

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
1. Empty list: Handled by base case
2. Single-element list: Handled through base case and insertion
3. Already sorted list: Properly maintained by insertion logic
4. Non-list input: Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for list type
2. Consider probabilistic extensions (e.g., uncertain element positions)
3. Add performance metrics for deep recursion cases

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic features used | Limited to classical Prolog | Consider adding probabilistic rules |
| 2      | No input type checking | May cause runtime errors | Add list validation predicate |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural network benefits | Consider adding nn/3 predicates if needed |

**Word Count:** 398 words

The implementation correctly performs classical insertion sort but doesn't utilize ProbLog's probabilistic capabilities. The code is logically sound for deterministic sorting operations but could benefit from additional robustness checks and potential probabilistic extensions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
