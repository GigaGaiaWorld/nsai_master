# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided population and area data, then finds country pairs where densities are within 5% of each other (using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations).

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 successful queries:
```
query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)**. The results correctly identify country pairs with similar population densities, and all probability values are 1.0000 as expected for deterministic queries.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented according to their specifications. The code properly handles:
- Population density calculation using integer arithmetic
- Pairwise comparison with 5% tolerance
- Alphabetical ordering of country pairs (C1 @< C2)

## Root Cause Analysis
In this classical ProbLog scenario (no probabilistic facts used):
1. **Logical Correctness**: 
   - The density calculation `D is (P*100) // A` correctly implements floor division after scaling
   - The comparison `20*D1 < 21*D2` properly approximates a 5% tolerance without division
   - The alphabetical ordering `C1 @< C2` prevents duplicate pairs

2. **Termination**: 
   - The program terminates as all predicates are non-recursive and operate on finite datasets
   - All arithmetic operations are well-defined for the given input ranges

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: 
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used (all probabilities are 1.0000)
   - DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are not used in this program

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for population density comparison
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required/used in this deterministic query
- Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

**Edge Cases Considered**:
- Integer arithmetic prevents floating-point precision issues
- Alphabetical ordering prevents duplicate country pairs
- All country data appears complete (no missing population/area pairs)

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Could add input validation for country names
2. Might consider adding probabilistic facts for uncertain data
3. Could extend with neural network predictions for future populations

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly fulfills all specified requirements for finding countries with similar population densities using efficient integer arithmetic comparisons. The test cases verify correct operation across different density ranges and country pairs.
