# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of insertion sort. The code aims to recursively sort a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and test case verification.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly:
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (lines 1-4)
2. Inserts the head element into the sorted sublist (lines 5-9)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:** The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) and recursive case are properly defined
2. **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates when the input list is empty
3. **Insert Operation:** The `insert_element/3` predicate correctly handles:
   - Empty list case (line 5)
   - Insertion before head (line 6-7)
   - Recursive insertion (line 8-9)

**ProbLog Analysis:**
1. The implementation uses classical Prolog semantics (no probabilistic facts)
2. No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used
3. All results show probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (classical Prolog subset)
3. Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty list input: Handled by base case
2. Single-element list: Handled through recursive base case
3. Already sorted list: Correctly processed by insertion logic

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Could add type checking for non-list inputs
2. Could include probabilistic variants (e.g., uncertain element positions)
3. Could add negative test cases for verification
