# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates outcomes between moves, and determines a winner from a series of moves. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Result:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The result correctly shows player2 as the winner (score -1: player1 loses twice and wins once), matching expected behavior.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following components were verified:
- Move definitions (lines 3-5)
- Beat relationships (lines 7-9)
- Outcome rules (lines 14-16)
- Play predicate (lines 18-21)
- Score computation (lines 23-26)
- Winner determination (lines 27-32)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:
1. **Logical correctness**: All rules properly implement game semantics
2. **Recursive termination**: Base cases exist for both `play/3` and `compute_score/2`
3. **Probabilistic compliance**: Though no probabilistic facts are used, the deterministic logic correctly handles:
   - Win/lose/draw outcomes
   - Score accumulation
   - Final winner determination

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network integration was implemented or required.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets classical reasoning requirements:
- Correctly models game rules and outcomes
- Handles series of moves through recursion
- Computes accurate final scores

**Edge case considerations**:
1. Non-list inputs would fail (no type checking)
2. Uneven move lists would fail (no length validation)
3. Performance with very long move lists untested
4. No protection against undefined moves

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type/length checks |
| 2 | No move validation | Undefined moves cause failure | Add move existence checks |
| 3 | Untested edge cases | Potential hidden bugs | Add tests for empty/uneven lists |

**Code quality**: The implementation is concise and correct for the given requirements. For production use, input validation and additional edge case handling would be recommended. The recursive approach is elegant but could be optimized for very long game sequences.
