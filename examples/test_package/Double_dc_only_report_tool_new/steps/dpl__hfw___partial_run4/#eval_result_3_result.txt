  "HASH": "DB25F467",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in core functionality. The module correctly implements arithmetic expression parsing and evaluation. However, lacks probabilistic features and error handling that could be beneficial.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Optional enhancements: 1) Add probabilistic detection rules (e.g., detect_number/2 with probabilities), 2) Add error handling for malformed expressions, 3) Include support for parentheses, 4) Add neural network integration via nn/3 predicates for actual image processing.",
  "Dependencies": [],
