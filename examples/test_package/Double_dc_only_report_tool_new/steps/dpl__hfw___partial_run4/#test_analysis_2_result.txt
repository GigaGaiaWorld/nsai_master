# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, constructs an expression list, and computes the result. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and proper handling of arithmetic operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided evaluates the expression: `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`

**Test Result:**
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],-10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
- Expected result: `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7 = 0.333... - 14 = -13.666...`
- Actual result: `-10.333...`
- **Test failed** - The computed result is incorrect

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `parse/2` predicate, specifically in the subtraction rule:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse([-1, *|T], R2),
 almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
```

**Problem:** The subtraction rule incorrectly transforms `A - B` into `A + (-1 * B)` but then adds them instead of subtracting. The rule should maintain the subtraction operation.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error**: The subtraction implementation is mathematically incorrect. It should compute `N1 - R2` instead of `N1 + R2`.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion is properly structured with base and recursive cases.
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: The program uses deterministic facts (probability 1.0) for detection, so probabilistic rules don't affect this calculation.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (fails on subtraction)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (all facts are deterministic)
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Division by zero is properly handled
   - Non-list inputs would fail (no type checking)
   - Deep recursion could cause stack overflow for very long expressions

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect subtraction implementation | Wrong calculation results | Change `N1 + R2` to `N1 - R2` in subtraction rule |
| 2 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for input lists |
| 3 | No error handling for invalid operators | Silent failures | Add validation for operator detection |

**Corrected Subtraction Rule:**
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse([-1, *|T], R2),
 almost_equal(N1 - R2, R).  % Changed from + to -
```

With this correction, the test case would produce the correct result of `-13.666666666666666`.
