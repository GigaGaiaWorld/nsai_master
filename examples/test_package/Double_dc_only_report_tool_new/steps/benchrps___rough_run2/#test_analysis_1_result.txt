# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on game rule definitions, outcome determination, and score calculation. The code should correctly model the classic game mechanics and determine winners from move sequences.

## Test Results Summary
The test query was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
- Game 1: rock vs paper → lose (P2 wins)
- Game 2: rock vs paper → lose (P2 wins)
- Game 3: rock vs scissor → win (P1 wins)
- Final score: -1 (1 win, 2 losses) → player2 wins

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly calculates outcomes and determines the winner based on move sequences.

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the implementation. All predicates function as intended:
- `move/1` correctly defines valid gestures (lines 3-5)
- `beats/2` accurately represents game rules (lines 7-9)
- `outcome/3` properly determines game results (lines 14-16)
- `play/3` and `compute_score/2` correctly process sequences (lines 18-25)
- `determine_winner/3` accurately interprets scores (lines 26-31)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:** All rules follow proper game logic with correct termination conditions
2. **Recursion:** Base case (`play([],[],[])`) and recursive case properly handle lists
3. **Score Calculation:** Accumulates results correctly with proper arithmetic

**Probabilistic Aspects:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- All outcomes are deterministic (probability 1.0000)
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct game logic
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required/used in this implementation
- Neural network integration: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used)

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty move lists handled by base cases
2. Draw conditions properly checked with `==` operator
3. Score calculation handles all three outcome types

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Input validation for non-move elements
2. Handling of unequal list lengths
3. Extension to probabilistic versions with weighted moves
