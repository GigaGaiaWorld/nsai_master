</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on game rule definitions, outcome determination, and score calculation. The code should correctly model the classic game mechanics and determine winners from move sequences.

## Test Results Summary
The test query was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
- Game 1: rock vs paper → lose (P2 wins)
- Game 2: rock vs paper → lose (P2 wins)
- Game 3: rock vs scissor → win (P1 wins)
- Final score: -1 (1 win, 2 losses) → player2 wins

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly calculates outcomes and determines the winner based on move sequences.

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the implementation. All predicates function as intended:
- `move/1` correctly defines valid gestures (lines 3-5)
- `beats/2` accurately represents game rules (lines 7-9)
- `outcome/3` properly determines game results (lines 14-16)
- `play/3` and `compute_score/2` correctly process sequences (lines 18-25)
- `determine_winner/3` accurately interprets scores (lines 26-31)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:** All rules follow proper game logic with correct termination conditions
2. **Recursion:** Base case (`play([],[],[])`) and recursive case properly handle lists
3. **Score Calculation:** Accumulates results correctly with proper arithmetic

**Probabilistic Aspects:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- All outcomes are deterministic (probability 1.0000)
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct game logic
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required/used in this implementation
- Neural network integration: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used)

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty move lists handled by base cases
2. Draw conditions properly checked with `==` operator
3. Score calculation handles all three outcome types

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Input validation for non-move elements
2. Handling of unequal list lengths
3. Extension to probabilistic versions with weighted moves

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | Implementation correct |

**Word Count:** 398 words

The implementation successfully models the rock-paper-scissors game with proper outcome determination and score calculation. All test cases pass with expected results, demonstrating correct logical implementation within classical ProbLog parameters.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
