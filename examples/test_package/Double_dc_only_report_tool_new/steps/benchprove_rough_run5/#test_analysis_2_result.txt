# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes basic predicates like `member/2` and several extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) as required. The purpose is to verify correctness in both classical and probabilistic contexts, and analyze test results against expected behavior.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 1.0000 (PASS)
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000 (FAIL)
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000 (FAIL)
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000 (FAIL)
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000 (FAIL)
```

Only 1 out of 5 tests passed. The successful test verified implication logic, while the others failed to produce expected results.

## Failure Localization

1. **opposite/1 failure** (Line N/A - Missing implementation):
   - Expected: Should succeed when the argument is not provable
   - Actual: Returns 0.0000 (false)

2. **expand/2 failure** (Lines with `expand` definitions):
   - Expected: Should succeed when expansion matches
   - Actual: Returns 0.0000 despite correct expansion rules

3. **includes/2 failure** (Line N/A - Missing implementation):
   - Expected: Should behave like member/2
   - Actual: Returns 0.0000

4. **extend/3 failure** (Line N/A - Missing implementation):
   - Expected: Should verify list extension
   - Actual: Returns 0.0000

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing Implementations**:
   - The predicates `opposite/1`, `includes/2`, and `extend/3` are queried but not implemented
   - `expand/2` is defined but not properly integrated into the prove/1 mechanism

2. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - The implication test passed because it follows classical logic: P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)∨P(B)
   - Missing negation handling for `opposite/1` violates P(¬A)=1−P(A) rule

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used" - no neural network integration present

## Overall Analysis

**Requirements Met**:
- Basic meta-interpreter works correctly
- Implication logic implemented properly
- Classical reasoning partially works

**Deficiencies**:
- 4/6 required extended predicates missing
- No probabilistic fact handling
- No neural network integration

**Edge Cases Overlooked**:
- Non-list inputs for list operations
- Deep recursion cases
- Undefined expansion rules
- Probabilistic fact negation

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing opposite/1 | Fails negation tests | Implement using \+ prove/1 |
| 2 | Missing includes/2 | Fails membership tests | Reuse member/2 logic |
| 3 | Missing extend/3 | Fails list extension | Implement head insertion |
| 4 | expand/2 not integrated | Fails expansion tests | Add prove(expand) clause |
| 5 | No probabilistic facts | Limited probabilistic reasoning | Add probabilistic facts/rules |
| 6 | No DeepProbLog | No neural integration | Consider nn/3 if needed |

**Word Count**: 423 words

The implementation shows promise in basic logical operations but requires completion of the extended predicates and proper integration with ProbLog's probabilistic features to meet all requirements. The meta-interpreter framework is correctly established but needs expansion to handle all specified operations.
