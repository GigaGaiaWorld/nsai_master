# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The purpose is to verify correctness of the implementation against specified requirements, including classical reasoning, probabilistic inference, and handling of extended predicates like `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, and others.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show mixed outcomes:
- **Passed**: `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` (1.0000)
- **Failed**: All other queries returned 0.0000 when they should have succeeded

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))`
   - Error: Missing implementation of `opposite/1` predicate
   - Location: Entire missing predicate

2. **Failed Query**: `prove(expand(double(3),6))`
   - Error: `expand/2` rules exist but aren't properly integrated with `prove/1`
   - Location: Missing prove clause for expand goals

3. **Failed Query**: `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))`
   - Error: Missing implementation of `includes/2` predicate
   - Location: Entire missing predicate

4. **Failed Query**: `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))`
   - Error: Missing implementation of `extend/3` predicate
   - Location: Entire missing predicate

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Issues**:
   - The meta-interpreter correctly handles basic goals and conjunctions
   - Only `implies/2` is properly implemented among the required extensions
   - Missing predicates cause automatic failure (0.0000 probability)

2. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - The working `implies/2` correctly follows `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`
   - Missing implementations prevent proper probability computation for other predicates

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration present)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation partially meets requirements:
- ✅ Basic meta-interpreter works correctly
- ✅ `implies/2` properly implemented
- ❌ 5/6 required extensions missing (`opposite`, `expand`, `includes`, `extend`, `refute`)
- ❌ Edge cases not handled (undefined predicates, non-list inputs)

Critical oversights:
1. Incomplete implementation of required predicates
2. No error handling for undefined goals
3. No integration between `expand/2` rules and `prove/1`

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `opposite/1` | Fails opposite proofs | Implement as `opposite(G) :- \+ prove(G).` |
| 2 | Missing `includes/2` | Fails membership tests | Implement using existing `member/2` |
| 3 | Missing `extend/3` | Fails list extension | Implement as `extend(L,X,[X|L]).` |
| 4 | Unconnected `expand/2` | Fails expansion proofs | Add `prove(expand(X,Y)) :- expand(X,Y).` |
| 5 | Missing `refute/1` | Cannot refute goals | Implement as `refute(G) :- \+ prove(G).` |

**Word count**: 423 words

The implementation shows promise but requires completion of all specified predicates and better integration between the rule definitions and the meta-interpreter. Special attention should be paid to edge cases and proper handling of probabilistic negation.
