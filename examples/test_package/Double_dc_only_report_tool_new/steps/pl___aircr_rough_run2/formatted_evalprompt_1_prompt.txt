<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under wind effects using probabilistic actuators. The purpose is to verify correct probabilistic reasoning about goal achievement and overrun exceptions within a 5-step timeframe.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability values without errors:
- `goal_reached/1` probabilities decrease over time (0.2625 at T=1 to 0.0570 at T=5)
- `overrun_exception/1` probabilities peak at T=4 (0.0127)
- No zero-probability results for impossible scenarios
- All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split)
2. Wind effect distributions (weak/strong with proper effect weights)
3. Position legality checks (0-10 range)
4. Goal condition verification

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator choice follows `P(a)=0.5, P(b)=0.5` as specified
2. Wind effects correctly use conditional probabilities:
   - Weak wind: `P(-1)=0.25, P(0)=0.5, P(+1)=0.25`
   - Strong wind: `P(-3)=0.2, P(-2)=0.3, P(+2)=0.3, P(+3)=0.2`
3. Position calculation combines deterministic movement (actuator strength) with probabilistic wind effects
4. No DeepProbLog features used (neural network integration not required)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly tracks position changes and goal conditions
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Properly combines actuator choice and wind effects
3. **Edge cases**: Handles illegal positions via overrun exceptions

Notable quality aspects:
- Time-bound queries prevent infinite recursion
- Legal position check prevents invalid states
- Wind effects scale appropriately with strength

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic modeling with proper handling of actuator selection, wind effects, and position boundaries. The decreasing probability of goal achievement over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty in the system's behavior.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
