# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under wind effects using probabilistic actuators. The purpose is to verify correct probabilistic reasoning about goal achievement and overrun exceptions within a 5-step timeframe.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability values without errors:
- `goal_reached/1` probabilities decrease over time (0.2625 at T=1 to 0.0570 at T=5)
- `overrun_exception/1` probabilities peak at T=4 (0.0127)
- No zero-probability results for impossible scenarios
- All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split)
2. Wind effect distributions (weak/strong with proper effect weights)
3. Position legality checks (0-10 range)
4. Goal condition verification

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator choice follows `P(a)=0.5, P(b)=0.5` as specified
2. Wind effects correctly use conditional probabilities:
   - Weak wind: `P(-1)=0.25, P(0)=0.5, P(+1)=0.25`
   - Strong wind: `P(-3)=0.2, P(-2)=0.3, P(+2)=0.3, P(+3)=0.2`
3. Position calculation combines deterministic movement (actuator strength) with probabilistic wind effects
4. No DeepProbLog features used (neural network integration not required)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly tracks position changes and goal conditions
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Properly combines actuator choice and wind effects
3. **Edge cases**: Handles illegal positions via overrun exceptions

Notable quality aspects:
- Time-bound queries prevent infinite recursion
- Legal position check prevents invalid states
- Wind effects scale appropriately with strength

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic modeling with proper handling of actuator selection, wind effects, and position boundaries. The decreasing probability of goal achievement over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty in the system's behavior.
