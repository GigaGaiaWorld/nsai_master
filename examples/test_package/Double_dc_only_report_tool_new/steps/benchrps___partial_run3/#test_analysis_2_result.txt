# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates results between players, computes scores, and determines winners. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and compliance with ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Returned:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The result correctly shows player2 as the winner (2 losses vs 1 win for player1), demonstrating proper implementation of game rules and scoring.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
- Basic move definitions (rock, paper, scissor)
- Win/lose relationships (beats/2)
- Game result calculation (result/3)
- Recursive play simulation (play/3)
- Score computation (compute_score/2)
- Winner determination (determine_winner/3)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All predicates follow proper logical relationships. The `beats/2` facts correctly model the game's win conditions.
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases (`[]` and `0` respectively).
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: While no probabilistic facts are used, the deterministic implementation correctly computes results with 1.0000 certainty.

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct game logic
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (deterministic implementation)
- Neural network integration: Not present

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. Empty move lists are handled by base cases
2. Draw conditions are properly identified
3. Score computation handles all three outcomes (win/lose/draw)

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Add input validation for move legality
2. Consider probabilistic extensions (e.g., weighted moves)
3. Add test cases for edge scenarios (empty lists, mixed cases)

## Error Summary
