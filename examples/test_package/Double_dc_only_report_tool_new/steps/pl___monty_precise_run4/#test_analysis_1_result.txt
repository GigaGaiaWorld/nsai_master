# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant picks a door (always door 1 in this implementation), the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the contestant must decide whether to keep their original choice or switch. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning correctly calculates the 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice and 2/3 chance by switching.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Equal 1/3 probability for the prize behind each door initially
2. Certainty of selecting door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- The probabilistic distribution of prizes (lines 1-2)
- Host's door opening rules (lines 4-15)
- Winning condition calculations (lines 16-21)

## Root Cause Analysis
The code demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. **Initial distribution**: `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` properly assigns equal probabilities
2. **Host behavior**: 
   - When two empty doors available, chooses randomly (50/50) via `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`
   - When only one empty door available, opens it certainly via deterministic `open_door(A)`
3. **Probability calculations**:
   - `win_keep` correctly computes P(prize behind initially selected door)
   - `win_switch` correctly computes P(prize behind other unopened door)

The implementation properly handles probabilistic negation through `\+ prize(A)` checks and maintains correct probability distributions throughout the scenario.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models the game rules and constraints
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes all probability distributions
- **Edge cases**: Properly handles both scenarios (one or two available doors to open)

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

### Key Strengths:
1. Clear separation of probabilistic and deterministic rules
2. Proper handling of the host's constrained choices
3. Correct probability propagation through the decision tree

### Potential Improvements:
1. Could generalize `select_door` to allow arbitrary initial choices
2. Could add visualization predicates to show the game state
