# ProbLog Meta-Interpreter Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog meta-interpreter implementation that extends basic logic programming with additional operators (`implies`, `opposite`, `expand`, `includes`, `extend`, `refute`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning capabilities, while checking edge cases and potential failure points.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned successful results with probability 1.0000:
```
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 1.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 1.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 1.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 1.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All expansion predicates function correctly:
- `implies/2` (line 12-14): Correctly implements P ⇒ Q as ¬P ∨ Q
- `opposite/1` (line 15-16): Proper negation using `\+`
- `expand/2` (line 17-19): Correctly handles arithmetic expansions
- `includes/2` (line 20-21): Proper list membership check
- `extend/3` (line 22-23): Correct list extension
- `refute/1` (line 25-26): Proper negation wrapper

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical ProbLog Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: All predicates maintain sound logical semantics:
   - Implication follows standard logical equivalence
   - Negation properly uses `\+` for negation as failure
   - Recursive predicates (`member/2`, `ancestor/2`) have proper base cases

2. **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**:
   - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` correctly implemented via `opposite/1` and `refute/1`
   - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` correctly implemented via `implies/2`

3. **DeepProbLog Check**: "DeepProbLog feature not used" (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully supported with correct implementations
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Proper handling of probabilistic facts and rules
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features)

### Edge Case Considerations
1. **Undefined `expand/2`**: Would fail gracefully (no unexpected behavior)
2. **Non-list Input**: `includes/2` would fail on non-list inputs (expected)
3. **Recursive Performance**: Deep recursion could cause stack issues (not tested)
4. **Type Safety**: No type checking (standard for Prolog)

The implementation demonstrates correct behavior for all tested scenarios. For production use, additional edge case testing (particularly for recursive depth and invalid inputs) would be recommended. The absence of DeepProbLog features limits the system to classical probabilistic logic programming.
