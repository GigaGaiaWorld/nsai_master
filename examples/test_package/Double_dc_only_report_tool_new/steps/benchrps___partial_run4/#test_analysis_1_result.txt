# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning about game outcomes. The code defines move relationships, win/lose rules, and implements game result calculation through recursive processing of move lists.

## Test Results Summary
The test query was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Result:**
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
- Player 1 moves: rock, rock, rock
- Player 2 moves: paper, paper, scissor
- Expected outcomes: lose (rock vs paper), lose (rock vs paper), win (rock vs scissor)
- Score calculation: -1 (lose) + -1 (lose) + 1 (win) = -1 â†’ player2 wins
- **All tests passed (no failures)** - The actual result matches the expected outcome

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates function as intended:
- `move/1` correctly defines all possible moves (lines 1-9)
- `beats/2` properly encodes game rules (lines 11-17)
- `result/3` accurately determines round outcomes (lines 19-27)
- `play/3` and `compute_score/2` correctly process move sequences (lines 29-45)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - All game rules are properly encoded with correct relationships
   - The recursive `play/3` predicate correctly processes lists of moves
   - Base cases for empty lists are properly defined

2. **Recursive Termination:**
   - Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases
   - Recursion properly reduces problem size at each step

**Probabilistic Aspects:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- All outcomes are deterministic based on game rules
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning fully implements rock-paper-scissors rules
- Correctly handles multiple rounds and score calculation
- Properly determines final winner based on accumulated score

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty move lists (handled by base cases)
2. Draw situations (score remains unchanged)
3. All possible move combinations (rock/paper/scissor)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for move lists
2. Consider probabilistic version with random move selection
3. Add type checking for move elements
