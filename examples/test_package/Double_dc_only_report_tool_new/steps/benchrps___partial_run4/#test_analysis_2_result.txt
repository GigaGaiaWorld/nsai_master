# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines the game rules, calculates results between players, computes scores, and determines the winner. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** 
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 as the winner with probability 1.0, which matches expected behavior:
- Round 1: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 2: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 3: rock beats scissor (player1 wins)
- Final score: -1 (player2 wins)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates are correctly defined:
1. `move/1` correctly defines all three gestures (lines 1-5)
2. `beats/2` correctly defines all win-lose relationships (lines 7-10)
3. `result/3` handles all game outcomes (lines 13-21)
4. `play/3` and `compute_score/2` correctly process move sequences (lines 24-35)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness:** All game rules are properly encoded with complete coverage of possible moves and outcomes
2. **Recursive Termination:** Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases and recursive cases
3. **Probabilistic Aspects:** The single test case shows correct probability computation (1.0 for deterministic input)
4. **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration was used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
1. **Complete Move Coverage:** All three gestures (rock, paper, scissor) are defined
2. **Proper Outcome Calculation:** Win/lose/draw conditions are correctly implemented
3. **Sequence Handling:** Can process multiple rounds and compute aggregate scores

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty move lists are handled (line 24)
2. Draw conditions are properly checked (line 13)
3. Score computation handles all three outcome types (lines 29-35)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Input validation for non-move elements
2. Performance testing with very long move sequences
3. Additional test cases with probabilistic moves
