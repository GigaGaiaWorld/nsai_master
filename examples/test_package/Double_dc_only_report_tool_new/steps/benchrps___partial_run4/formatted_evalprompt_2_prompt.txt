</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines the game rules, calculates results between players, computes scores, and determines the winner. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** 
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 as the winner with probability 1.0, which matches expected behavior:
- Round 1: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 2: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 3: rock beats scissor (player1 wins)
- Final score: -1 (player2 wins)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates are correctly defined:
1. `move/1` correctly defines all three gestures (lines 1-5)
2. `beats/2` correctly defines all win-lose relationships (lines 7-10)
3. `result/3` handles all game outcomes (lines 13-21)
4. `play/3` and `compute_score/2` correctly process move sequences (lines 24-35)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness:** All game rules are properly encoded with complete coverage of possible moves and outcomes
2. **Recursive Termination:** Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases and recursive cases
3. **Probabilistic Aspects:** The single test case shows correct probability computation (1.0 for deterministic input)
4. **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration was used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
1. **Complete Move Coverage:** All three gestures (rock, paper, scissor) are defined
2. **Proper Outcome Calculation:** Win/lose/draw conditions are correctly implemented
3. **Sequence Handling:** Can process multiple rounds and compute aggregate scores

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty move lists are handled (line 24)
2. Draw conditions are properly checked (line 13)
3. Score computation handles all three outcome types (lines 29-35)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Input validation for non-move elements
2. Performance testing with very long move sequences
3. Additional test cases with probabilistic moves

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and passes all test cases. No errors were found in the evaluation.

**Word Count:** 398 words

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
