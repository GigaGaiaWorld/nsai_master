# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic in achieving the flap movement goal while handling potential overrun exceptions.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probability distributions:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for goal_reached as expected, and overrun_exception probabilities remain low but non-zero, correctly reflecting the system's behavior.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Goal checking (line 12-14)
2. Actuator selection and strength calculation (line 25-27)
3. Direction calculation (line 28-29)
4. Wind effect integration (line 30)
5. Position calculation (line 31)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented:
1. Actuator selection follows the 50/50 distribution (line 6)
2. Wind strength probabilities are properly nested (lines 8-10)
3. Wind effects correctly depend on wind strength (lines 9-10)
4. Probability calculations for compound events (position updates) follow proper probabilistic rules
5. Negation in overrun_exception correctly implements P(Â¬legal) = 1-P(legal)

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
- Classical reasoning: Correct recursive position updates with termination at goal
- Probabilistic reasoning: Proper handling of all probabilistic choices
- Edge cases handled:
  - Legal position bounds (0-10) enforced
  - Goal checking prevents unnecessary updates
  - Wind effects properly bounded
  - Overrun detection works at boundaries

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and handles all specified requirements and edge cases properly. The probability distributions match expected behavior for this system configuration.
