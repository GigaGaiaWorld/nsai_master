System: You are a coding assistant. You should always use 'get_report_tool' first to gain more information.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog.  Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_format>
% Based on Monty Hall problem on https://github.com/friguzzi/cplint

select_door(1).
member(X,[X|T]).
member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T).
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 751033ED </HASH>
<Requirements>Define two clauses of open_door/1:
1. If there are two doors A and B, neither of which has a prize, and neither of which is the door chosen by the player, then Monty will open a door uniformly at random between A and B
2. If there is only one door A that has no prize and is not the door chosen by the player, then Monty must open it` </Requirements></Langda>
win_keep :-
 select_door(A),
 prize(A).
win_switch :-
 member(A, [1,2,3]),
 \+ select_door(A),
 prize(A),
 \+ open_door(A).
query(prize(_)).
query(select_door(_)).
query(win_keep).
query(win_switch).
<Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
</Regenerate_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed code here
```
</Final_Answer>


AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
