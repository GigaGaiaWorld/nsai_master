# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical syntax error. The error message indicates an unknown clause for an empty predicate at position 6:158. No queries could be executed successfully due to this compilation failure.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate definition (lines 6-158). The parser encounters malformed syntax when processing the conditional probability statement. The specific issues are:
1. Incorrect syntax for probabilistic choice in the first case (when Len=2)
2. Missing proper separation between conditional cases

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation fails due to:
1. **Syntax Error**: The probabilistic choice `0.5::open_door(Door)` is incorrectly placed within the rule body rather than being properly structured as a probabilistic fact.
2. **Logical Structure**: The conditional cases aren't properly separated using Prolog's if-then-else construct (`->`/`;`).

In probabilistic terms, the implementation attempts to:
- Model uniform random selection (P=0.5) when two doors are available
- Model deterministic selection (P=1.0) when only one door is available
However, the syntax doesn't properly express these probabilistic choices according to ProbLog's requirements.

## Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet functional requirements due to compilation errors. Key observations:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Not testable due to compilation failure
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Syntax prevents proper probability computation
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used (as expected)

Edge case considerations:
- Undefined cases for door selection
- Non-list inputs to member/2 predicate
- Recursive termination in member/2 (correctly implemented)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect probabilistic syntax in open_door/1 | Compilation failure | Restructure using proper ProbLog syntax for probabilistic choices |
| 2 | Malformed conditional statement | Logical flow broken | Use proper if-then-else structure with clear cases |
| 3 | Missing base case for door selection | Potential runtime errors | Ensure all door selection cases are covered |

## Corrected Implementation Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(Door) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    (
        Len = 2 -> 
        member(Door, AvailableDoors),
        0.5::door_open(Door) ;  % Separate probabilistic fact
        Len = 1 -> 
        member(Door, AvailableDoors),
        door_open(Door)          % Deterministic case
    ).
```

The corrected version separates the probabilistic facts from the rule definition and uses proper ProbLog syntax for probability annotations. This should resolve the compilation error while maintaining the intended probabilistic behavior.
