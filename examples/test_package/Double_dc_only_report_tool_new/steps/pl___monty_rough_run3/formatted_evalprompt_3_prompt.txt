</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the player decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and compliance with the specified requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in an error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:158
```

No queries could be executed successfully due to this compilation error. The error occurs during parsing of the `open_door/1` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
The error is located in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-158 in the original code). The parser encountered an unexpected operator (`->`) without proper clause structure. The problematic code block is:
```prolog
open_door(Door) :- 
    select_door(Selected), 
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors), 
    length(AvailableDoors, Len), 
    (Len = 2 -> member(Door, AvailableDoors), 0.5::door_open(Door) ; 
     Len = 1 -> member(Door, AvailableDoors), door_open(Door)).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The immediate cause is improper use of the conditional operator `->` without proper parentheses and clause structure.
2. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic (random selection between two available doors or forced selection of one door) is conceptually correct but syntactically invalid.
3. **Probabilistic Rules**: The attempt to use `0.5::door_open(Door)` within a conditional branch is problematic in ProbLog's syntax.

Key issues:
- Missing parentheses around the conditional branches
- Improper mixing of probabilistic facts with conditional logic
- The `door_open/1` predicate is used but never properly defined

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but non-functional due to syntax errors
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Attempted but incorrectly implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code doesn't handle cases where the player's initial selection might contain the prize
   - The door opening logic assumes exactly 1 or 2 available doors, which is correct for this problem but not explicitly validated
   - No checks for invalid door numbers or other edge cases

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in conditional operator | Code cannot execute | Rewrite conditional logic with proper Prolog syntax |
| 2 | Undefined door_open/1 predicate | Runtime failure would occur | Define the predicate or restructure without it |
| 3 | Improper probabilistic fact placement | Invalid ProbLog syntax | Move probabilistic facts to top level or use proper annotation syntax |
| 4 | Missing parentheses in findall | Logical error | Add proper nesting of parentheses |

## Corrected Implementation Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(Door) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    open_available(Len, AvailableDoors, Door).

open_available(2, [D1,D2], Door) :- 
    Prob is 1/2, 
    Prob::door_open(D1), 
    Prob::door_open(D2),
    (door_open(D1) -> Door = D1 ; Door = D2).
open_available(1, [D], D).
```

This report identifies the critical syntax error preventing execution and provides recommendations for proper ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem scenario.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
