# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by either keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:158
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error. The system cannot find the required clauses for proper execution.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-158 in the original code). The specific issues are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate definition contains malformed syntax that ProbLog cannot parse
2. **Structural Problem**: The conditional logic (if-then-else) is not properly implemented in ProbLog syntax
3. **Missing Definitions**: The `->/2` operator is not properly handled in this context

## Root Cause Analysis

### Classical ProbLog Issues
1. The `open_door/1` predicate attempts to use Prolog-style conditionals (`->`) without proper ProbLog syntax
2. The probabilistic annotation `0.5::door_open(Door)` is incorrectly placed within a conditional branch
3. The predicate lacks proper termination conditions for all cases

### Probabilistic Reasoning Issues
1. The probability distribution for door opening isn't properly defined according to ProbLog standards
2. The negation operator `\+` is used without proper probabilistic handling
3. The mixing of deterministic and probabilistic facts isn't properly structured

### DeepProbLog Integration
DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet its requirements due to fundamental syntax and structural issues. Key problems include:

1. **Incorrect Conditional Handling**: ProbLog requires different syntax for probabilistic conditionals
2. **Probability Distribution**: The 50-50 split for two available doors isn't properly implemented
3. **Edge Cases**: The code doesn't handle all possible door configurations robustly

The requirements specify two clear cases for door opening, but the implementation fails to properly encode either case in valid ProbLog syntax.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in conditional | Code won't compile | Use ProbLog's if-then-else syntax |
| 2 | Improper probability annotation | Incorrect probability calculations | Move probability declarations outside conditionals |
| 3 | Missing base cases | Possible infinite recursion | Add proper termination conditions |
| 4 | Improper mixing of deterministic/probabilistic | Undefined behavior | Separate deterministic and probabilistic parts |

## Recommended Fixes
The `open_door/1` predicate should be restructured as:

```problog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    (Len = 2, member(Door, AvailableDoors), 0.5::door_open(Door);
    Len = 1, member(Door, AvailableDoors), door_open(Door).
```

This maintains the original logic while using proper ProbLog syntax. The probability annotation should be handled at the fact level rather than within conditional branches.

The evaluation reveals fundamental syntax issues that prevent the code from executing. Addressing these structural problems is necessary before the probabilistic aspects can be properly evaluated.
