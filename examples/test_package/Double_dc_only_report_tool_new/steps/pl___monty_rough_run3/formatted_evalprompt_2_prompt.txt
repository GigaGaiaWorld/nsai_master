</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by either keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:158
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error. The system cannot find the required clauses for proper execution.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-158 in the original code). The specific issues are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate definition contains malformed syntax that ProbLog cannot parse
2. **Structural Problem**: The conditional logic (if-then-else) is not properly implemented in ProbLog syntax
3. **Missing Definitions**: The `->/2` operator is not properly handled in this context

## Root Cause Analysis

### Classical ProbLog Issues
1. The `open_door/1` predicate attempts to use Prolog-style conditionals (`->`) without proper ProbLog syntax
2. The probabilistic annotation `0.5::door_open(Door)` is incorrectly placed within a conditional branch
3. The predicate lacks proper termination conditions for all cases

### Probabilistic Reasoning Issues
1. The probability distribution for door opening isn't properly defined according to ProbLog standards
2. The negation operator `\+` is used without proper probabilistic handling
3. The mixing of deterministic and probabilistic facts isn't properly structured

### DeepProbLog Integration
DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet its requirements due to fundamental syntax and structural issues. Key problems include:

1. **Incorrect Conditional Handling**: ProbLog requires different syntax for probabilistic conditionals
2. **Probability Distribution**: The 50-50 split for two available doors isn't properly implemented
3. **Edge Cases**: The code doesn't handle all possible door configurations robustly

The requirements specify two clear cases for door opening, but the implementation fails to properly encode either case in valid ProbLog syntax.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in conditional | Code won't compile | Use ProbLog's if-then-else syntax |
| 2 | Improper probability annotation | Incorrect probability calculations | Move probability declarations outside conditionals |
| 3 | Missing base cases | Possible infinite recursion | Add proper termination conditions |
| 4 | Improper mixing of deterministic/probabilistic | Undefined behavior | Separate deterministic and probabilistic parts |

## Recommended Fixes
The `open_door/1` predicate should be restructured as:

```problog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    (Len = 2, member(Door, AvailableDoors), 0.5::door_open(Door);
    Len = 1, member(Door, AvailableDoors), door_open(Door).
```

This maintains the original logic while using proper ProbLog syntax. The probability annotation should be handled at the fact level rather than within conditional branches.

The evaluation reveals fundamental syntax issues that prevent the code from executing. Addressing these structural problems is necessary before the probabilistic aspects can be properly evaluated.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
