# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the player decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and compliance with the specified requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in an error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:158
```

No queries could be executed successfully due to this compilation error. The error occurs during parsing of the `open_door/1` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
The error is located in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-158 in the original code). The parser encountered an unexpected operator (`->`) without proper clause structure. The problematic code block is:
```prolog
open_door(Door) :- 
    select_door(Selected), 
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors), 
    length(AvailableDoors, Len), 
    (Len = 2 -> member(Door, AvailableDoors), 0.5::door_open(Door) ; 
     Len = 1 -> member(Door, AvailableDoors), door_open(Door)).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The immediate cause is improper use of the conditional operator `->` without proper parentheses and clause structure.
2. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic (random selection between two available doors or forced selection of one door) is conceptually correct but syntactically invalid.
3. **Probabilistic Rules**: The attempt to use `0.5::door_open(Door)` within a conditional branch is problematic in ProbLog's syntax.

Key issues:
- Missing parentheses around the conditional branches
- Improper mixing of probabilistic facts with conditional logic
- The `door_open/1` predicate is used but never properly defined

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but non-functional due to syntax errors
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Attempted but incorrectly implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code doesn't handle cases where the player's initial selection might contain the prize
   - The door opening logic assumes exactly 1 or 2 available doors, which is correct for this problem but not explicitly validated
   - No checks for invalid door numbers or other edge cases

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in conditional operator | Code cannot execute | Rewrite conditional logic with proper Prolog syntax |
| 2 | Undefined door_open/1 predicate | Runtime failure would occur | Define the predicate or restructure without it |
| 3 | Improper probabilistic fact placement | Invalid ProbLog syntax | Move probabilistic facts to top level or use proper annotation syntax |
| 4 | Missing parentheses in findall | Logical error | Add proper nesting of parentheses |

## Corrected Implementation Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(Door) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    open_available(Len, AvailableDoors, Door).

open_available(2, [D1,D2], Door) :- 
    Prob is 1/2, 
    Prob::door_open(D1), 
    Prob::door_open(D2),
    (door_open(D1) -> Door = D1 ; Door = D2).
open_available(1, [D], D).
```

This report identifies the critical syntax error preventing execution and provides recommendations for proper ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem scenario.
