# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program contains population and area data for various countries and should implement a query to find matching density pairs.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a complete failure with the error message: "No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7". This indicates the required query predicate `query_pop/1` has not been implemented, despite being specified in the requirements.

## Failure Localization
- **Failed Query**: `query_pop(_)`
- **Location**: Line 59
- **Error**: Missing implementation of the `query_pop/1` predicate
- **Expected**: The program should define `query_pop/1` to find country pairs with similar population densities
- **Actual**: No implementation exists for this required predicate

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issue is a missing predicate implementation. The program correctly defines:
```prolog
density(Country, Density) :- 
    pop(Country, Pop), 
    area(Country, Area), 
    Density is (Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000).
```
But fails to implement the required query functionality. In classical ProbLog terms, the program lacks the necessary rules to:
1. Compare densities between different countries
2. Calculate the 5% threshold
3. Return valid pairs

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Status**:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (basic density calculation works)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized
- Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

**Edge Cases Not Handled**:
- No protection against comparing a country with itself
- No handling for missing population/area data
- No input validation for the query

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `query_pop/1` implementation | Complete failure | Implement the required query predicate |
| 2 | No density comparison logic | Cannot find matching pairs | Add rules to compare densities |
| 3 | No 5% threshold calculation | Cannot determine "approximately equal" | Implement percentage difference calculation |

**Recommended Implementation**:
```prolog
query_pop([Country1,Density1,Country2,Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    Diff is abs(Density1 - Density2),
    MaxDiff is max(Density1, Density2) * 0.05,
    Diff =< MaxDiff.
```

This solution would:
1. Calculate densities for all country pairs
2. Ensure different countries are compared
3. Calculate absolute and maximum allowed difference
4. Return pairs within the 5% threshold

The complete implementation would satisfy all requirements while maintaining logical correctness in the ProbLog framework.
