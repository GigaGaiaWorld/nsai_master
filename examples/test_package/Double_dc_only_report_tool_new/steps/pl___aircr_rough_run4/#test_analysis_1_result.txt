# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system models actuator selection, wind effects, and flap position control with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and identify any potential issues in the implementation.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probabilities for queries at time steps 1 through 5:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
- goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
- goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
- goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
- goal_reached(5) = 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for goal_reached as expected, and overrun_exception probabilities remain low but increase slightly before decreasing, which aligns with the system's behavior.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- The `attempted_flap_position` rule (hash A5C06F43) correctly calculates positions
- Wind effects and actuator selection work probabilistically
- Goal checking and overrun detection operate as specified

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection follows the specified 50/50 distribution
2. Wind effects properly condition on wind strength (weak/strong)
3. Probability calculations for position updates correctly combine:
   - Actuator strength (deterministic)
   - Wind effects (probabilistic)
   - Direction calculation (deterministic)
4. The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` correctly implements P(Â¬A) = 1-P(A)

**DeepProbLog Feature:** DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
- **Classical reasoning:** Correctly handles position updates and goal checking
- **Probabilistic reasoning:** Properly combines multiple probability distributions
- **Edge cases:**
  - Legal position checking prevents invalid states
  - Time bounds prevent infinite recursion
  - Wind effects cover both positive and negative impacts

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add validation for actuator strength values
2. Consider modeling actuator failure probabilities
3. Add more detailed wind effect scenarios

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and handles the specified scenario properly. The probabilities behave as expected for this control system model.
