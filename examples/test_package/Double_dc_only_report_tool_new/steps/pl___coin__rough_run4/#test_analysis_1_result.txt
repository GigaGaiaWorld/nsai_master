# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that simulates tossing multiple biased coins (with 0.8 probability of heads) and calculates the probability distribution of possible outcomes. The program uses recursive rules to accumulate the count of heads when tossing 4 independent coins.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 heads when tossing 4 coins with P(heads)=0.8:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly match the expected binomial distribution probabilities for n=4 trials with p=0.8 success probability.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly implements the counting mechanism, and the probability calculations properly account for both success (heads) and failure (tails) cases.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: 
   - The recursive rules properly handle both cases (coin lands heads or tails) through the two clauses of `coins_r/3`
   - Base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` correctly terminates the recursion

2. **Probabilistic Calculations**:
   - The probability of heads (0.8) and tails (0.2, via negation) are correctly handled
   - The combined probabilities match binomial distribution: P(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
   - For example, P(2 heads) = 6 * (0.8)^2 * (0.2)^2 = 0.1536 matches the result

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network components present)

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets the functional requirements:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct recursive counting implementation
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurate probability calculations for independent events
- **Edge cases**: 
  - Handles CNT=0 case properly
  - Recursion depth is limited (CNT=4) so performance isn't an issue
  - All input cases are properly typed

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

The implementation correctly models the probabilistic coin toss scenario and produces mathematically accurate results. The code is well-structured with proper handling of both the success and failure cases in the recursive counting process. No improvements or corrections are needed for this implementation.
