# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, which simulates a game show scenario where a contestant selects between three doors with one containing a prize. The code models both "keep" and "switch" strategies after the host opens a non-prize door.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities match the expected theoretical values:
- Equal 1/3 probability for each door containing the prize
- 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the original choice
- 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
1. Random prize placement (uniform distribution)
2. Host behavior rules (both when two empty doors remain and when one empty door remains)
3. Win condition calculations for both strategies

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. Prize distribution: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for each door (lines 1-2)
2. Host behavior:
   - When two empty doors: random selection (50/50) between them (lines 5-8)
   - When one empty door: deterministic selection of empty door (lines 10-13)
3. Win conditions:
   - `P(win_keep) = P(prize(selected)) = 1/3` (line 15)
   - `P(win_switch) = 1 - P(win_keep) = 2/3` (lines 17-19)

The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
- `P(Â¬prize(X)) = 2/3` for any door
- Host actions properly condition on the prize location
- No DeepProbLog features were used (neural network integration not required)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
- Classical reasoning (door selection rules, host behavior)
- Probabilistic reasoning (correct probability distributions)

Edge cases properly handled:
- All possible prize locations covered
- Host behavior covers all possible door configurations
- Input validation not needed as door selection is fixed

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct | 

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic reasoning and proper handling of all game scenarios. The test results confirm the theoretical probabilities for both strategies, demonstrating a correct and complete solution.
