# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code should correctly model the game show scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens a non-prize door, and we calculate probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:14.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs when trying to evaluate the `open_door/1` predicate. The system cannot find the required clauses for this predicate. Key issues identified:

1. The `open_door/1` predicate is not properly defined before its use in `win_switch`
2. The error message suggests a syntax issue around line 10, column 14 (likely related to operator usage)

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues stem from:

1. **Missing Predicate Definition**: The `open_door/1` predicate is used in `win_switch` before its complete definition is provided
2. **Syntax Error**: The error suggests malformed syntax in the predicate definition
3. **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**: While the probabilistic facts for `prize/1` are correctly defined, the interaction with `open_door/1` isn't properly implemented

The classical ProbLog aspects show correct probability distribution for the prize location (1/3 for each door), but the host's door-opening behavior isn't properly integrated.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation partially meets requirements but fails in execution:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Basic structure is correct but incomplete
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Prize distribution is correctly modeled
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases not properly handled:
- No validation for door selection
- No handling for cases where all doors might have prizes (though impossible in this scenario)
- No explicit negation handling in the door selection process

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing/incomplete `open_door/1` definition | Critical failure | Complete the predicate definition before use |
| 2 | Syntax error in predicate definition | Execution failure | Review operator usage and clause structure |
| 3 | Predicate used before definition | Logical flow issue | Reorder predicates or add forward declarations |

```prolog
% Suggested correction approach:
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    random_member(Door, AvailableDoors).
```

The implementation requires restructuring to:
1. Properly define all predicates before use
2. Fix syntax issues in the `open_door/1` definition
3. Ensure logical flow matches the Monty Hall problem requirements
