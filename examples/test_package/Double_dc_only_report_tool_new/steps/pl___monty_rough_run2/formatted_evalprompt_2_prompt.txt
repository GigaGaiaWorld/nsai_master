</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code should correctly model the game show scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens a non-prize door, and we calculate probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:14.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs when trying to evaluate the `open_door/1` predicate. The system cannot find the required clauses for this predicate. Key issues identified:

1. The `open_door/1` predicate is not properly defined before its use in `win_switch`
2. The error message suggests a syntax issue around line 10, column 14 (likely related to operator usage)

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues stem from:

1. **Missing Predicate Definition**: The `open_door/1` predicate is used in `win_switch` before its complete definition is provided
2. **Syntax Error**: The error suggests malformed syntax in the predicate definition
3. **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**: While the probabilistic facts for `prize/1` are correctly defined, the interaction with `open_door/1` isn't properly implemented

The classical ProbLog aspects show correct probability distribution for the prize location (1/3 for each door), but the host's door-opening behavior isn't properly integrated.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation partially meets requirements but fails in execution:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Basic structure is correct but incomplete
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Prize distribution is correctly modeled
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases not properly handled:
- No validation for door selection
- No handling for cases where all doors might have prizes (though impossible in this scenario)
- No explicit negation handling in the door selection process

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing/incomplete `open_door/1` definition | Critical failure | Complete the predicate definition before use |
| 2 | Syntax error in predicate definition | Execution failure | Review operator usage and clause structure |
| 3 | Predicate used before definition | Logical flow issue | Reorder predicates or add forward declarations |

```prolog
% Suggested correction approach:
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    random_member(Door, AvailableDoors).
```

The implementation requires restructuring to:
1. Properly define all predicates before use
2. Fix syntax issues in the `open_door/1` definition
3. Ensure logical flow matches the Monty Hall problem requirements

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
