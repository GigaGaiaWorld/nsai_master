# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code should correctly model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens a non-prize door, and we calculate probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:158
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-158 in the original code). The system cannot find the expected clause implementation for the probabilistic choice operation (`0.5::open_door(Door)`).

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The probabilistic fact syntax `0.5::open_door(Door)` is incorrectly placed inside a rule body. In ProbLog, probabilistic facts must be defined at the top level.

2. **Logical Structure**: The current implementation attempts to mix deterministic and probabilistic choices in a single rule, which violates ProbLog's execution model.

3. **Missing Definitions**: The code references `member/2` but doesn't properly handle list membership in all cases, which could lead to incomplete solutions.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but incomplete
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Incorrect implementation
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling for invalid door selections
   - No validation for list inputs in member/2
   - No base case for empty lists in member/2

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect probabilistic fact placement | Code fails to execute | Move probabilistic choices to top level |
| 2 | Incomplete member/2 implementation | Potential infinite recursion | Add base case for empty list |
| 3 | Mixed deterministic/probabilistic logic | Incorrect probability calculations | Separate deterministic and probabilistic parts |

## Corrected Implementation Suggestion
```prolog
% Probabilistic facts at top level
1/3::prize(1); 1/3::prize(2); 1/3::prize(3).
0.5::open_door_a; 0.5::open_door_b.

% Deterministic rules
select_door(1).
member(X,[X|_]).
member(X,[_|T]) :- member(X,T).

open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    (Len = 2 -> (open_door_a -> Door = AvailableDoors.1 ; Door = AvailableDoors.2)
    ; Len = 1 -> [Door] = AvailableDoors).
```

The corrected version properly separates probabilistic and deterministic components while maintaining the original problem's logic.
