</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, where a player selects a door behind which there may be a prize, and the host opens another door revealing no prize. The implementation should correctly model the host's behavior and calculate probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate. The error message indicates an "Unmatched character '(' at 6:150", suggesting improper parenthesis handling in the conditional statement.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-8). The main issues are:
1. Missing parentheses around the entire conditional structure
2. Improper use of the conditional operator `->`
3. Incorrect structure of the nested conditionals

## Root Cause Analysis
The syntax error prevents the program from running at all. In classical ProbLog terms:
1. The conditional structure violates Prolog syntax rules
2. The predicate attempts to handle two cases (Len=2 and Len=1) but does so incorrectly
3. The random selection between two available doors isn't properly implemented

Probabilistically, the intended behavior should:
1. When two doors are available (Len=2), select one randomly (P=0.5 for each)
2. When one door is available (Len=1), select it deterministically (P=1)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet functional requirements due to the syntax error. Key issues include:
1. **Classical reasoning**: The member/2 predicate is correctly defined but unused due to the error
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: The prize distribution is correctly defined but not properly utilized
3. **Edge cases**: The code doesn't handle cases where the player's initial selection might be invalid

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unmatched parentheses in open_door/1 | Code cannot execute | Rewrite the conditional structure with proper syntax |
| 2 | Improper conditional handling | Logical flow broken | Use proper if-then-else structure with clear cases |
| 3 | Missing edge case handling | Potential runtime errors | Add validation for door selection |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    (Len = 2 -> 
        random(0.5, R),
        (R < 0.5 -> nth0(0, AvailableDoors, Door) ; nth0(1, AvailableDoors, Door))
    ;
    Len = 1 -> 
        nth0(0, AvailableDoors, Door)
    ).
```

The evaluation shows the implementation requires significant syntax correction before it can properly model the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic behavior. The core logic appears conceptually correct but isn't executable in its current form.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
