# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling robot navigation and key pickup scenarios with probabilistic outcomes. The code implements probabilistic facts for action success/failure rates and defines predicates for robot/key positions over time steps. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query probabilities:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures) as the results correctly reflect:
1. The probabilistic outcomes of robot movements and key pickup attempts
2. The proper chaining of time steps through recursive predicates
3. Correct handling of both success and failure cases

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
1. `carrying/2` properly handles both pickup success and retention cases
2. `at/3` for robot movement correctly models all three scenarios (successful move, failed move, no move)
3. `at/3` for key position correctly tracks key movement when carried and stationary when not carried

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic computations are correct:
1. Negation probabilities comply with P(¬A)=1−P(A)
2. Conjunctive probabilities are properly multiplied
3. Recursive cases properly propagate probabilities through time steps

Key correct behaviors:
- The 0.7/0.3 split for pickup success/failure is maintained
- The 0.9/0.1 split for goto success/failure is preserved
- Slippery key probabilities (0.6/0.4 and 0.2/0.8 splits) are correctly applied

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models state transitions through time
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes outcome probabilities
3. **Edge cases**: Handles all movement and pickup scenarios properly

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. Multiple keys scenario (current code assumes single key)
2. Simultaneous actions (current model processes one action per time step)
3. Deep recursion performance (not an issue with small time horizons)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the specified robot navigation and key pickup scenario with accurate probabilistic outcomes. All test cases pass as expected, demonstrating correct handling of both the logical and probabilistic aspects of the problem.
