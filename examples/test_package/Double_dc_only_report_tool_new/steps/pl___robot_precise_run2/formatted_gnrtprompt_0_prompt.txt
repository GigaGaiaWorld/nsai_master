System: You are a coding assistant. You should complete the task.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.

 If at time T the robot's action list contains goto(Pos), and this move succeeds, then at the next time s(T), the robot will be at the goal position Pos.
 If goto(Pos) is executed at time T, but goto_succeeds(T) is false (i.e. the move failed), then at time s(T) the robot remains where it is.
 If there is no goto(_) action at time T (goto_action(T) is false), then at time s(T) the robot remains stationary. </Requirements></Langda>

AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
