# Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The code recursively splits a list, sorts the sublists, and merges them back together. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, recursive termination, and edge case handling in classical ProbLog scenarios.

## Test Results Summary
The test query was:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following components were verified:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list) - lines 1-2
2. Recursive splitting and merging - lines 3-20
3. Helper predicates (`split_list/3`, `merge/3`, `append/3`) - lines 12-20

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct behavior in classical ProbLog:
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The recursion terminates properly (base cases handle lists of length 0 and 1)
   - The splitting (`split_list/3`) and merging (`merge/3`) logic is sound

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used (pure classical Prolog implementation)
   - The probability 1.0000 indicates deterministic behavior
   - DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty list: correctly returns empty list
   - Single-element list: returns the same list
   - Odd-length lists: handled by integer division in `split_list/3`

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
- Correctly implements the merge sort algorithm
- Handles all specified edge cases
- Maintains proper recursive termination

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add type checking for non-list inputs
2. Consider performance for very large lists (deep recursion)
3. Add probabilistic elements if needed (e.g., uncertain comparisons)

The implementation is functionally correct and demonstrates proper use of recursive algorithms in ProbLog. While no probabilistic features were utilized in this example, the classical Prolog components are well-structured and verified.
