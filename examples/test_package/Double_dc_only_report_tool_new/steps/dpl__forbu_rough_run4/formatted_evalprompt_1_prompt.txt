    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:22.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its functionality and identifying any issues in the code. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog execution, as no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are present in this implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test case `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))` failed with an error indicating that the `->/2` operator is not properly handled in the ProbLog environment. The error message suggests the system cannot find clauses for the conditional operator at line 4, position 22.

## Failure Localization
The failure occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically in the conditional statement:
```prolog
(Swapped == true ->
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
;
    append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
)
```
(Line 4 in the original code block)

The error indicates that ProbLog doesn't recognize the standard Prolog conditional operator `->/2` in this context.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The bubblesort algorithm logic appears correct for standard Prolog, with proper recursive termination conditions.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: The code doesn't contain any probabilistic facts or rules, so probabilistic rules don't apply here.
3. **DeepProbLog Features**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present in this implementation. "DeepProbLog feature not used".

The main issue stems from using standard Prolog syntax (`->/2` operator) in a ProbLog environment, which has different syntactic requirements for conditionals.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The classical reasoning implementation is logically correct but fails in ProbLog due to syntax incompatibility.
2. **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly (via the base cases), but non-list inputs would cause type errors.
3. **Performance**: The recursive implementation could face performance issues with large lists due to the O(n²) nature of bubblesort.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog doesn't recognize `->/2` operator | Code fails to execute | Rewrite conditional using ProbLog-compatible syntax or use standard Prolog |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | Limited to classical sorting | Add probabilistic facts if probabilistic behavior is desired |
| 3 | No type checking for input | Non-list inputs would fail | Add input validation if needed |

**Recommendation**: To make this work in ProbLog, either:
1. Rewrite the conditional using ProbLog's syntax (likely using probabilistic choice points), or
2. Run the code in a standard Prolog environment where the `->/2` operator is natively supported.

The implementation would work correctly in standard Prolog, but needs modification for ProbLog compatibility. The core sorting algorithm itself is correctly implemented with proper base cases and recursive logic.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
