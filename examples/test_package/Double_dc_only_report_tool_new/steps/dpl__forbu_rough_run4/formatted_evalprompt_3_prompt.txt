    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'append/3' at 2:33.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically examining its functionality as an interpretable `bubblesort/3` predicate. The code was tested with a query to sort the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`, but encountered an execution error.

## Test Results Summary
The test query was:
```prolog
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Test Result**: Failed with error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'append/3' at 2:33.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the second clause of the `bubblesort/3` predicate (line 2):
```prolog
bubblesort([X], Acc, Sorted) :- append([X], Acc, Sorted).
```

The system cannot find the definition of the `append/3` predicate, which is crucial for list concatenation operations. This is a built-in predicate in standard Prolog but appears to be missing in the ProbLog environment where this code was tested.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Built-in Predicate**: The implementation assumes the availability of `append/3` which is not present in the ProbLog environment being used.
2. **Logical Structure**: The algorithm's logic appears correct for a bubblesort implementation:
   - Base case handles empty list
   - Single element case attempts to append (but fails)
   - Recursive cases properly handle element comparison and swapping
3. **Termination**: The recursive structure shows proper termination conditions.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (logic is correct but missing dependency)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements in this code)
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Missing `append/3` implementation is critical
   - Non-list inputs would cause type errors
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with very large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `append/3` predicate | Complete failure of sorting functionality | Implement custom append/3 or ensure environment provides it |
| 2 | ProbLog environment mismatch | Code may run in standard Prolog but fails here | Verify environment requirements or modify implementation |

**Recommendation**: Implement a custom `append/3` predicate or switch to an environment that provides this built-in functionality. The following implementation would resolve the issue:

```prolog
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L, [H|R]) :- append(T, L, R).
```

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
