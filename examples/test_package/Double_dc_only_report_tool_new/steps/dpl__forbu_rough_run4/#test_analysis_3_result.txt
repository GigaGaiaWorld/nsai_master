# Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically examining its functionality as an interpretable `bubblesort/3` predicate. The code was tested with a query to sort the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`, but encountered an execution error.

## Test Results Summary
The test query was:
```prolog
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Test Result**: Failed with error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'append/3' at 2:33.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the second clause of the `bubblesort/3` predicate (line 2):
```prolog
bubblesort([X], Acc, Sorted) :- append([X], Acc, Sorted).
```

The system cannot find the definition of the `append/3` predicate, which is crucial for list concatenation operations. This is a built-in predicate in standard Prolog but appears to be missing in the ProbLog environment where this code was tested.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Built-in Predicate**: The implementation assumes the availability of `append/3` which is not present in the ProbLog environment being used.
2. **Logical Structure**: The algorithm's logic appears correct for a bubblesort implementation:
   - Base case handles empty list
   - Single element case attempts to append (but fails)
   - Recursive cases properly handle element comparison and swapping
3. **Termination**: The recursive structure shows proper termination conditions.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (logic is correct but missing dependency)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements in this code)
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Missing `append/3` implementation is critical
   - Non-list inputs would cause type errors
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with very large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `append/3` predicate | Complete failure of sorting functionality | Implement custom append/3 or ensure environment provides it |
| 2 | ProbLog environment mismatch | Code may run in standard Prolog but fails here | Verify environment requirements or modify implementation |

**Recommendation**: Implement a custom `append/3` predicate or switch to an environment that provides this built-in functionality. The following implementation would resolve the issue:

```prolog
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L, [H|R]) :- append(T, L, R).
```
