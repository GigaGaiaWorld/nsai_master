# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog bubblesort implementation adapted for ProbLog compatibility. The code aims to provide an interpretable sorting algorithm through recursive list processing. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, ProbLog compatibility, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate between lines 4-12. Specifically:
- The conditional operator `->/2` is not properly supported in ProbLog
- The predicate fails at the comparison operation `(X > Y -> ...)`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm logic is correct for standard Prolog but incompatible with ProbLog's restricted syntax
2. **Recursive Termination**: The base cases are properly defined but never reached due to the syntax error
3. **ProbLog Compatibility**: The implementation uses Prolog's conditional operator which isn't supported in ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning context
4. **DeepProbLog Feature**: DeepProbLog features (neural networks, tensors) are not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct logic but incompatible syntax)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not met (syntax prevents execution)
   - Neural integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input not handled
   - Empty list case correctly implemented but untested
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog doesn't support `->/2` operator | Complete failure | Replace with `if_then_else/3` or separate clauses |
| 2 | No probabilistic facts/rules | Limited to classical Prolog | Add probabilistic annotations if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking predicates |

```prolog
% Suggested revision (ProbLog compatible)
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort([X], Acc, Sorted) :- append([X], Acc, Sorted).
bubblesort([X, Y | Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X =< Y,
    bubblesort([X, Y | Rest], Acc, Sorted).
bubblesort([X, Y | Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X > Y,
    bubblesort([Y, X | Rest], Acc, Sorted).
```

The evaluation reveals the implementation requires modification to comply with ProbLog's syntax restrictions while maintaining the sorting algorithm's logical correctness. The suggested revision separates the comparison cases into distinct clauses, eliminating the unsupported conditional operator.
