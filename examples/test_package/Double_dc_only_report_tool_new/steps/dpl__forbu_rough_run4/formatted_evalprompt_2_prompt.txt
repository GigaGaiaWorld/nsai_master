    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog bubblesort implementation adapted for ProbLog compatibility. The code aims to provide an interpretable sorting algorithm through recursive list processing. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, ProbLog compatibility, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate between lines 4-12. Specifically:
- The conditional operator `->/2` is not properly supported in ProbLog
- The predicate fails at the comparison operation `(X > Y -> ...)`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm logic is correct for standard Prolog but incompatible with ProbLog's restricted syntax
2. **Recursive Termination**: The base cases are properly defined but never reached due to the syntax error
3. **ProbLog Compatibility**: The implementation uses Prolog's conditional operator which isn't supported in ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning context
4. **DeepProbLog Feature**: DeepProbLog features (neural networks, tensors) are not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct logic but incompatible syntax)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not met (syntax prevents execution)
   - Neural integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input not handled
   - Empty list case correctly implemented but untested
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog doesn't support `->/2` operator | Complete failure | Replace with `if_then_else/3` or separate clauses |
| 2 | No probabilistic facts/rules | Limited to classical Prolog | Add probabilistic annotations if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking predicates |

```prolog
% Suggested revision (ProbLog compatible)
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort([X], Acc, Sorted) :- append([X], Acc, Sorted).
bubblesort([X, Y | Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X =< Y,
    bubblesort([X, Y | Rest], Acc, Sorted).
bubblesort([X, Y | Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X > Y,
    bubblesort([Y, X | Rest], Acc, Sorted).
```

The evaluation reveals the implementation requires modification to comply with ProbLog's syntax restrictions while maintaining the sorting algorithm's logical correctness. The suggested revision separates the comparison cases into distinct clauses, eliminating the unsupported conditional operator.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
