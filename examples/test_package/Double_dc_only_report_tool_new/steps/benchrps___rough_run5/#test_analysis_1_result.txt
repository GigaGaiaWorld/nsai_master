# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates outcomes between moves, computes scores, and determines winners for a series of moves. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Returned:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The result correctly shows player2 as the winner (score -1: player1 loses twice and wins once), matching expected behavior.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following components were verified:
- Move definitions (lines 3-5)
- Beat relationships (lines 7-9)
- Outcome rules (lines 14-16)
- Play predicate (lines 18-21)
- Score computation (lines 23-26)
- Winner determination (lines 27-32)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All rules properly encode rock-paper-scissors semantics
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: No probabilistic facts are used (pure logical program)
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (no neural network integration)

The score computation correctly implements:
- +1 for each win
- -1 for each loss
- 0 for draws

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct game logic
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (pure deterministic program)
- Neural network integration: Not required/implemented

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. Empty move lists (handled by base case)
2. Equal moves (draw outcome)
3. All possible move combinations (rock-paper, paper-scissor, etc.)

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Add input validation for non-move atoms
2. Consider extending to probabilistic version with move distributions
3. Add tie-breaking rules for tournament scenarios

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | N/A |

The implementation is correct and handles the basic rock-paper-scissors game requirements effectively. For extended functionality, probabilistic or learning components could be added, but these are beyond current requirements.
