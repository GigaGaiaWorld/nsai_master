</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates outcomes between moves, computes scores, and determines winners for a series of moves. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Returned:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The result correctly shows player2 as the winner (score -1: player1 loses twice and wins once), matching expected behavior.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following components were verified:
- Move definitions (lines 3-5)
- Beat relationships (lines 7-9)
- Outcome rules (lines 14-16)
- Play predicate (lines 18-21)
- Score computation (lines 23-26)
- Winner determination (lines 27-32)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All rules properly encode rock-paper-scissors semantics
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: No probabilistic facts are used (pure logical program)
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (no neural network integration)

The score computation correctly implements:
- +1 for each win
- -1 for each loss
- 0 for draws

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct game logic
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (pure deterministic program)
- Neural network integration: Not required/implemented

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. Empty move lists (handled by base case)
2. Equal moves (draw outcome)
3. All possible move combinations (rock-paper, paper-scissor, etc.)

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Add input validation for non-move atoms
2. Consider extending to probabilistic version with move distributions
3. Add tie-breaking rules for tournament scenarios

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | N/A |

The implementation is correct and handles the basic rock-paper-scissors game requirements effectively. For extended functionality, probabilistic or learning components could be added, but these are beyond current requirements.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
