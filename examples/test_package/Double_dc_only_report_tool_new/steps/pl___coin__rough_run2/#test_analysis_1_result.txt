# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that models coin tossing behavior. The code implements a probabilistic coin model where each coin has an 80% chance of landing heads, then counts the number of heads when tossing multiple coins. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both the logical implementation and probabilistic calculations.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 heads when tossing 4 coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```
All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly match the expected binomial distribution for 4 trials with p=0.8.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base case termination in `coins_r/3`
2. Recursive case for both heads and tails outcomes
3. Probability accumulation through recursive calls

## Root Cause Analysis
The code correctly implements probabilistic reasoning:
1. Each coin toss is an independent event with P(heads)=0.8
2. The negation case `\+ coin(CNT)` correctly gets P(tails)=0.2
3. The recursive counting properly accumulates probabilities:
   - For N coins, P(k heads) = C(N,k) * (0.8)^k * (0.2)^(N-k)
4. The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` ensures proper termination

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly implements recursive counting
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately calculates binomial probabilities
3. **Edge cases**: Handles all possible outcomes (0-4 heads)

Potential improvements:
1. Could make the number of coins (currently hardcoded to 4) parameterizable
2. Could add input validation for negative counts

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic calculations follow proper probability theory rules, and the recursive logic is sound with proper termination conditions.
