# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the classical Prolog implementation and assess its compliance with specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and handling of basic list operations.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
With result:
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list as expected. The probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic correctness in this case.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The predicates are properly defined:
- `insertion_sort/2` (lines 1-3) handles both base case and recursive case
- `insert/3` (lines 4-7) correctly places elements in sorted order

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates:
1. **Logical Correctness**: 
   - Proper recursive decomposition of the list (head-tail pattern)
   - Correct comparison operations (`=<` and `>`) for element insertion
   - Proper base case handling for empty lists

2. **Recursive Termination**:
   - The recursion terminates when the input list is empty
   - Each recursive call processes a smaller sublist (tail of original list)

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - The result shows deterministic behavior (probability 1.0)
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets the functional requirements for classical Prolog reasoning:
- Correctly implements insertion sort algorithm
- Handles basic list operations properly
- Shows proper recursive structure

**Edge Case Considerations**:
1. Non-list input would fail (expected behavior in strongly typed Prolog)
2. Empty list is properly handled
3. Already sorted lists would work correctly
4. Lists with duplicate elements would sort correctly
5. Performance degrades with O(nÂ²) complexity for large lists (inherent to insertion sort)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct for the tested case and appears robust for standard insertion sort operations. For production use, additional test cases with edge conditions (empty lists, single-element lists, already-sorted lists) could be added for comprehensive verification.
