</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the classical Prolog implementation and assess its compliance with specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and handling of basic list operations.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
With result:
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list as expected. The probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic correctness in this case.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The predicates are properly defined:
- `insertion_sort/2` (lines 1-3) handles both base case and recursive case
- `insert/3` (lines 4-7) correctly places elements in sorted order

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates:
1. **Logical Correctness**: 
   - Proper recursive decomposition of the list (head-tail pattern)
   - Correct comparison operations (`=<` and `>`) for element insertion
   - Proper base case handling for empty lists

2. **Recursive Termination**:
   - The recursion terminates when the input list is empty
   - Each recursive call processes a smaller sublist (tail of original list)

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - The result shows deterministic behavior (probability 1.0)
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets the functional requirements for classical Prolog reasoning:
- Correctly implements insertion sort algorithm
- Handles basic list operations properly
- Shows proper recursive structure

**Edge Case Considerations**:
1. Non-list input would fail (expected behavior in strongly typed Prolog)
2. Empty list is properly handled
3. Already sorted lists would work correctly
4. Lists with duplicate elements would sort correctly
5. Performance degrades with O(n²) complexity for large lists (inherent to insertion sort)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct for the tested case and appears robust for standard insertion sort operations. For production use, additional test cases with edge conditions (empty lists, single-element lists, already-sorted lists) could be added for comprehensive verification.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
