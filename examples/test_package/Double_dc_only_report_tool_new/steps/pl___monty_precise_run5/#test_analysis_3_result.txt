# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant selects a door (always door 1), the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
All test results match the expected probabilities:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results correctly show a 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice and 2/3 chance by switching, which aligns with the known mathematical solution to the Monty Hall problem.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
1. Uniform prize distribution (lines 1-2)
2. Fixed initial selection (line 3)
3. Host's door opening rules (lines 6-16)
4. Win condition calculations (lines 18-24)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. Prize distribution uses proper probability mass: `1/3` for each door (line 1)
2. The `open_door` rules correctly implement the host's behavior:
   - When two empty doors are available, opens one randomly (50/50) (lines 6-8)
   - When only one empty door remains, opens it with certainty (lines 10-16)
3. Probability calculations follow standard rules:
   - `P(win_keep) = P(prize(1)) = 1/3`
   - `P(win_switch) = 1 - P(win_keep) = 2/3`

The classical Prolog components (member/2, all_empty/1) are correctly implemented with proper recursive termination.

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network integration was required for this problem.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
- Classical reasoning (door selection, prize checking)
- Probabilistic reasoning (prize distribution, host behavior)

Edge cases properly handled:
1. The host never opens the selected door
2. The host never opens the prize door
3. Handles all possible prize locations
4. Correctly identifies when only one valid door remains to open

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation is correct |

The code is well-structured and correctly implements the Monty Hall problem scenario with accurate probability calculations. No modifications are needed for this implementation.
