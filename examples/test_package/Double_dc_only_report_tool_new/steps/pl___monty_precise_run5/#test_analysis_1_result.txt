# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the contestant decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The implementation should correctly calculate the probabilities of winning in both scenarios.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the parser. The error occurs at line 11, character 83, with an unmatched parenthesis in the rule for `open_door(A)`. No queries could be executed successfully due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Component**: `open_door/1` predicate
   - Location: Line 11
   - Error: Unmatched parenthesis in the rule body
   - Problematic Code:
     ```prolog
     open_door(A) :- select_door(Selected), member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), \+ prize(A), forall((member(Other, [1,2,3]), (Other \= Selected, Other \= A -> prize(Other))).
     ```
   - The `forall` construct is incorrectly formatted with mismatched parentheses

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**:
   - The `forall` statement contains unbalanced parentheses and incorrect comma placement
   - The condition `(Other \= Selected, Other \= A -> prize(Other))` is not properly structured for ProbLog syntax

2. **Logical Structure**:
   - The intended logic appears to be checking that all other unselected doors (besides A) contain prizes
   - The current implementation mixes Prolog-style syntax with ProbLog requirements

3. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - The first `open_door` rule correctly implements the 50/50 choice when two empty doors are available
   - The deterministic case (one empty door) is conceptually correct but syntactically invalid

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but incomplete due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly structured in the first `open_door` rule
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case of two empty doors correctly
   - The single empty door case is conceptually addressed but syntactically invalid
   - No protection against invalid inputs (non-list structures)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unmatched parenthesis in `open_door/1` | Code cannot execute | Fix `forall` structure and balance parentheses |
| 2 | Incorrect comma placement in condition | Logical error | Use proper ProbLog syntax for conditions |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for valid door numbers |

**Recommendation**: Rewrite the problematic rule as:
```prolog
open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ prize(A),
    findall(Other, (member(Other,[1,2,3]), Other \= Selected, Other \= A), Others),
    maplist(prize, Others).
```

This implementation would correctly verify that all other unselected doors contain prizes while maintaining proper ProbLog syntax. The word count for this report is approximately 420 words.
