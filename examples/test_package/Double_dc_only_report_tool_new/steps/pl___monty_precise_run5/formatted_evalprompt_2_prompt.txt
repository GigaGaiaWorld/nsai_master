</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the contestant decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning and correct implementation of the game's rules.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a missing predicate error. The key error message indicates:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'maplist/2' at 17:5
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 16-17) where the code attempts to use `maplist/2` without proper definition. This predicate is not natively available in ProbLog and needs to be explicitly defined or replaced.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The code correctly models the initial door selection and prize distribution with probabilistic facts (lines 1-2).
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The probability computations for prize distribution (1/3 each) are correctly specified.
3. **Missing Functionality**: The implementation fails because:
   - `maplist/2` is not defined (classical Prolog predicate not available in ProbLog)
   - The alternative `open_door` rule using probabilistic disjunction has syntax errors (incomplete rule definition)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (missing predicate implementation)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly specified for prize distribution
   - DeepProbLog: Feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Missing handling for all possible door configurations
   - No validation for door selection constraints
   - Incomplete rule definitions could lead to unexpected failures

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `maplist/2` predicate | Code execution failure | Implement custom list checking or use ProbLog alternatives |
| 2 | Incomplete `open_door` rule | Logical incompleteness | Complete the rule definition or remove if unused |
| 3 | Syntax error in probabilistic disjunction | Compilation failure | Fix the rule syntax or restructure the probability definition |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Replace maplist implementation with explicit checks
open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ prize(A),
    findall(Other, (member(Other,[1,2,3]), Other \= Selected, Other \= A), Others),
    all_empty(Others).  % Custom predicate to check all doors are empty

all_empty([]).
all_empty([H|T]) :- \+ prize(H), all_empty(T).
```

The evaluation reveals the implementation is conceptually correct but suffers from technical execution issues primarily due to missing predicate definitions. Addressing these would make the model operational while maintaining the correct probabilistic reasoning for the Monty Hall scenario.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
