# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the contestant decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning and correct implementation of the game's rules.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a missing predicate error. The key error message indicates:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'maplist/2' at 17:5
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 16-17) where the code attempts to use `maplist/2` without proper definition. This predicate is not natively available in ProbLog and needs to be explicitly defined or replaced.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The code correctly models the initial door selection and prize distribution with probabilistic facts (lines 1-2).
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The probability computations for prize distribution (1/3 each) are correctly specified.
3. **Missing Functionality**: The implementation fails because:
   - `maplist/2` is not defined (classical Prolog predicate not available in ProbLog)
   - The alternative `open_door` rule using probabilistic disjunction has syntax errors (incomplete rule definition)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (missing predicate implementation)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly specified for prize distribution
   - DeepProbLog: Feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Missing handling for all possible door configurations
   - No validation for door selection constraints
   - Incomplete rule definitions could lead to unexpected failures

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `maplist/2` predicate | Code execution failure | Implement custom list checking or use ProbLog alternatives |
| 2 | Incomplete `open_door` rule | Logical incompleteness | Complete the rule definition or remove if unused |
| 3 | Syntax error in probabilistic disjunction | Compilation failure | Fix the rule syntax or restructure the probability definition |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Replace maplist implementation with explicit checks
open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ prize(A),
    findall(Other, (member(Other,[1,2,3]), Other \= Selected, Other \= A), Others),
    all_empty(Others).  % Custom predicate to check all doors are empty

all_empty([]).
all_empty([H|T]) :- \+ prize(H), all_empty(T).
```

The evaluation reveals the implementation is conceptually correct but suffers from technical execution issues primarily due to missing predicate definitions. Addressing these would make the model operational while maintaining the correct probabilistic reasoning for the Monty Hall scenario.
