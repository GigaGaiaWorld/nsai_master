<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the cryptoaddition puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must satisfy three key constraints:
1. First digits cannot be zero
2. All letters represent unique digits
3. Column-wise addition with proper carry handling

## Test Results Summary
The test query `query_sum([X6, X7, X8, X9, X10])` returned a probability of 0.0000, indicating no solutions were found. This constitutes a test failure since valid solutions should exist for this puzzle.

## Failure Localization
The failure occurs in the main `query_sum` predicate where:
1. The carry constraints (Carry3 = 0) may be too restrictive
2. The digit uniqueness constraint may be eliminating valid solutions
3. The sumdigit calculations may not properly account for all possible carry scenarios

Key problematic code section:
```prolog
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :- 
    leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C), 
    all_different([A,B,C,D,E]), 
    sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Carry1), 
    sumdigit(Carry1, A, C, D, Carry2), 
    sumdigit(Carry2, 0, B, C, Carry3), 
    Carry3 = 0.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The constraints are logically sound but may be over-constrained. The requirement that Carry3 must be 0 forces B+C to be <10, which may not always hold.

2. **Recursive Termination**: The `all_different` predicate correctly terminates but may prune valid solutions due to the strict carry constraints.

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: Since this is a pure logical puzzle without probabilistic facts, the 0.0000 result indicates no solutions satisfied all constraints.

4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration was used (as expected for this classical puzzle).

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct constraints but no solutions found)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The carry handling may miss valid solutions where final carry ≠ 0
   - First-digit constraints are properly handled
   - Digit uniqueness is correctly enforced

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Over-constrained carry | No solutions found | Relax final carry constraint |
| 2 | Strict digit uniqueness | May eliminate valid solutions | Verify with smaller digit sets first |
| 3 | Column addition logic | Potential miscalculations | Add debug output for intermediate sums |

**Recommendation**: Modify the carry constraints and add diagnostic output to identify which constraint is eliminating valid solutions. A valid solution (e.g., 12 + 234 = 246) should satisfy the puzzle constraints when properly implemented.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
