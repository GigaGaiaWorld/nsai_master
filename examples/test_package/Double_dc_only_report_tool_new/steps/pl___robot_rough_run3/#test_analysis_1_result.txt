# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's key pickup scenario with probabilistic outcomes. The code handles actions like picking up keys, moving between locations, and managing slippery conditions with associated probabilities. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic logic and classical reasoning.

## Test Results Summary
The program executed 2 queries with the following results:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4813
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6300
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3630
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0070
```
All tests passed (no failures) - the results show logically consistent probabilities that properly account for all possible execution paths.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- Key carrying rules (lines 1-10) correctly model pickup and retention
- Movement rules (lines 23-30) properly handle success/failure cases
- Probability distributions (lines 12-21) correctly implement the specified likelihoods

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic logic correctly implements:
1. Negation rules: `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` is properly used in drop conditions
2. Action outcomes: Success/failure probabilities (0.7/0.3 pickup, 0.9/0.1 goto) are correctly propagated
3. Recursive cases: All recursive predicates (carrying/2, slippery/2) have proper base cases
4. Probability composition: Joint probabilities are correctly calculated through the execution paths

DeepProbLog feature not used - no neural network integration present.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models state transitions
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes outcome probabilities
3. **Edge cases**: Handles recursive depth s(s(s(0))) appropriately
4. **Termination**: All recursive rules have proper base cases

Potential improvements:
1. Adding bounds checking for position values
2. Including validation for maximum recursion depth
3. Adding comments explaining probability compositions

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete for the specified requirements. All probabilistic calculations follow standard probability rules and the classical logic properly models the domain scenario. No errors were detected during evaluation.
