# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models the scenario where a contestant selects a door (always door 1 in this implementation), the host opens another door following specific rules, and calculates the probabilities of winning by either keeping the original choice or switching doors.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Equal initial probability distribution for the prize (1/3 each)
2. Consistent selection of door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the original choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates correctly implement the Monty Hall problem logic:
1. The `open_door/1` rules correctly handle both scenarios (when two empty doors remain and when one empty and one prize door remain)
2. The `win_keep` and `win_switch` predicates accurately model the winning conditions

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. Initial prize distribution: P(prize(X)) = 1/3 for X âˆˆ {1,2,3}
2. Negation handling: `\+ prize(A)` correctly computes 1-P(prize(A))
3. Conditional probabilities in `open_door` rules properly account for host's behavior
4. The 1/3 vs 2/3 winning probabilities align with known mathematical solutions

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models the game rules and constraints
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes probabilities for all scenarios
3. **Edge cases**: Handles all possible prize locations and door selections

The code properly handles edge cases such as:
- All possible prize locations (doors 1-3)
- All possible host door-opening scenarios
- Both winning strategies (keep vs switch)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

The implementation is correct and complete, with no identified issues. The test results confirm the code accurately models the Monty Hall problem and produces mathematically correct probabilities for both strategies.
