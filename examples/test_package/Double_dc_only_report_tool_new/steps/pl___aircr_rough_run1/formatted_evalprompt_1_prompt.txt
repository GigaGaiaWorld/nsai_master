<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under varying wind conditions and actuator choices, with probabilistic outcomes for both successful goal achievement and overrun exceptions.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probabilities for each query:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
- goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
- goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
- goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
- goal_reached(5) = 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for goal achievement while overrun exceptions show a small but increasing probability, which matches expected behavior for this system.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split)
- Wind strength modeling (weak/strong with appropriate effects)
- Position calculation with wind effects
- Goal checking and overrun detection

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented:
1. Actuator selection follows the defined 0.5 probability distribution
2. Wind strength probabilities (0.7 weak, 0.3 strong) are properly applied
3. Wind effects are correctly conditioned on wind strength
4. Position calculation accounts for:
   - Current position (line 20-25)
   - Actuator strength (line 5-6)
   - Wind effect (line 10-12)
   - Direction to goal (line 25)

Probability rules are correctly followed:
- P(¬goal_reached) = 1 - P(goal_reached)
- P(overrun_exception) properly accumulates when positions go outside legal range

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Correct position tracking and goal checking
- Probabilistic reasoning: Proper handling of all probabilistic choices
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Verified:**
- Initial position (6) and goal (4) are legal positions
- Wind effects can cause both positive and negative adjustments
- Overrun detection works at boundaries (0 and 10)
- Time steps properly increment (1-5)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add validation for initial position being legal
2. Consider adding maximum time steps as a parameter
3. Could add visualization of position probability distributions

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the aircraft flap control system with appropriate probabilistic behavior. All test cases pass with expected probability distributions, showing decreasing likelihood of reaching the goal over time while maintaining low but non-zero overrun probabilities.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
