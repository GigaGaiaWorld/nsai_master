# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under varying wind conditions and actuator choices, with probabilistic outcomes for both successful goal achievement and overrun exceptions.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probabilities for each query:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
- goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
- goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
- goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
- goal_reached(5) = 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for goal achievement while overrun exceptions show a small but increasing probability, which matches expected behavior for this system.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split)
- Wind strength modeling (weak/strong with appropriate effects)
- Position calculation with wind effects
- Goal checking and overrun detection

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented:
1. Actuator selection follows the defined 0.5 probability distribution
2. Wind strength probabilities (0.7 weak, 0.3 strong) are properly applied
3. Wind effects are correctly conditioned on wind strength
4. Position calculation accounts for:
   - Current position (line 20-25)
   - Actuator strength (line 5-6)
   - Wind effect (line 10-12)
   - Direction to goal (line 25)

Probability rules are correctly followed:
- P(Â¬goal_reached) = 1 - P(goal_reached)
- P(overrun_exception) properly accumulates when positions go outside legal range

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Correct position tracking and goal checking
- Probabilistic reasoning: Proper handling of all probabilistic choices
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Verified:**
- Initial position (6) and goal (4) are legal positions
- Wind effects can cause both positive and negative adjustments
- Overrun detection works at boundaries (0 and 10)
- Time steps properly increment (1-5)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add validation for initial position being legal
2. Consider adding maximum time steps as a parameter
3. Could add visualization of position probability distributions

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the aircraft flap control system with appropriate probabilistic behavior. All test cases pass with expected probability distributions, showing decreasing likelihood of reaching the goal over time while maintaining low but non-zero overrun probabilities.
