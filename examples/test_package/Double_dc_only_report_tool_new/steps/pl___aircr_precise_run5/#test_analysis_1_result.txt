# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic for this safety-critical system.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability values without failures:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time as expected, and overrun exceptions only appear after the first step when positions might exceed legal bounds.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Goal checking (line 12-14)
- Actuator selection (line 5-6, 21)
- Position calculation (line 22-26)
- Wind effects (line 8-10)
- Legal position validation (line 3, 16-19)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection follows the 50/50 distribution (line 5)
2. Wind strength probabilities correctly sum to 1 (line 7-10)
3. Wind effect distributions are properly conditioned (line 8-10)
4. Position calculation combines deterministic and probabilistic components correctly (line 22-26)

Classical logic aspects are properly implemented:
- The recursive position calculation terminates via the Time > 0 check (line 15)
- Goal checking prevents unnecessary movements (line 14)
- Legal position validation prevents invalid states (line 16-19)

DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network components).

## 5. Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct handling of position updates and goal checking
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper combination of actuator selection and wind effects
- **Edge cases**: Legal position validation prevents invalid states

Potential improvements:
1. Add explicit bounds checking for position arithmetic
2. Consider adding a maximum time limit
3. Could benefit from DeepProbLog integration for learning wind patterns

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The implementation is correct and handles all specified requirements. The decreasing probability of goal_reached over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty from actuator selection and wind effects.
