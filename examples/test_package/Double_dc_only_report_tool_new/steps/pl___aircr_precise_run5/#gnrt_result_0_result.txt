Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <Langda> section in the origin_code. The <Langda> section describes the requirements for the `attempted_flap_position` predicate, which is completed in the generated_code.

Here's the extracted and formatted code block:

```problog
{"HASH": "064BF451","Code": "attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-    Time > 0,    Prev is Time-1,    flap_position(Prev,Old),    \+ goal_reached(Prev),    goal(GP),    use_actuator(Time,A),    actuator_strength(A,AS),    AE is sign(GP - Old) * AS,    wind_effect(Time,WE),    Pos is Old + AE + WE."}
```
