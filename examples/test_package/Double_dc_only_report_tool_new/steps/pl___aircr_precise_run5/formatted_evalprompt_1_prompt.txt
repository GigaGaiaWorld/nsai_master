 1. Check if the goal has been reached:
 If Old already satisfies goal(Old), no new trial position is calculated.
 
 2.Determine the current actuator and its strength:
 Select actuator A (use_actuator) according to time Time, and get its thrust AS from actuator_strength(A).
 
 3. Calculate the direction and contribution of the actuator
 Take the global target position GP (goal(GP)), and compare the difference direction between GP and Old:
 - If the target is in front of the current direction, AE = +AS; if in the opposite direction, AE = −AS;
 - Specific calculation: AE = sign(GP − Old) × AS.
 
 4. Superimpose wind interference:
 Take the additional effect WE of the wind force on the position at that moment from wind_effect(Time).
 
 Combine the trial position of this step:
 Add the three parts and get the current attempt flapping position Pos. </Requirements></Langda>

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic for this safety-critical system.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability values without failures:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time as expected, and overrun exceptions only appear after the first step when positions might exceed legal bounds.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Goal checking (line 12-14)
- Actuator selection (line 5-6, 21)
- Position calculation (line 22-26)
- Wind effects (line 8-10)
- Legal position validation (line 3, 16-19)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection follows the 50/50 distribution (line 5)
2. Wind strength probabilities correctly sum to 1 (line 7-10)
3. Wind effect distributions are properly conditioned (line 8-10)
4. Position calculation combines deterministic and probabilistic components correctly (line 22-26)

Classical logic aspects are properly implemented:
- The recursive position calculation terminates via the Time > 0 check (line 15)
- Goal checking prevents unnecessary movements (line 14)
- Legal position validation prevents invalid states (line 16-19)

DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network components).

## 5. Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct handling of position updates and goal checking
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper combination of actuator selection and wind effects
- **Edge cases**: Legal position validation prevents invalid states

Potential improvements:
1. Add explicit bounds checking for position arithmetic
2. Consider adding a maximum time limit
3. Could benefit from DeepProbLog integration for learning wind patterns

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The implementation is correct and handles all specified requirements. The decreasing probability of goal_reached over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty from actuator selection and wind effects.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
