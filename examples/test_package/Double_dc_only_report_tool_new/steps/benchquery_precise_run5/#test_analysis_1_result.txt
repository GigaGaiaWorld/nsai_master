# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided population and area data, then finds country pairs where densities differ by less than 5% using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful queries:
```
query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All queries returned valid country pairs with density ratios within the specified 5% margin, and all probabilities were correctly reported as 1.0000 (deterministic results).

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented according to the requirements. The code properly:
1. Calculates densities using integer arithmetic (lines 2-4 in density/2)
2. Filters country pairs with density ratios <1.05 (lines 4-6 in query_pop/1)
3. Avoids duplicate pairs with alphabetical ordering (line 3 in query_pop/1)

## Root Cause Analysis
In this classical ProbLog scenario:
1. **Logical correctness**: The program correctly implements the specified constraints without recursion or complex control flow.
2. **Probabilistic aspects**: The results are deterministic (probability 1.0) as no probabilistic facts are involved.
3. **Arithmetic validation**: The density calculation `D is (P * 100) // A` and ratio comparison `20*D1 < 21*D2` correctly implement the requirements without floating-point operations.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration was used or required ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for population density comparison
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required (deterministic data)
- Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge cases considered:**
1. **Undefined countries**: Not an issue as all queries use defined facts
2. **Zero division**: Prevented by using factual area data (all >0)
3. **Pair ordering**: Ensured by `C1 @< C2` constraint
4. **Integer precision**: Maintained by scaling population before division

**Potential improvements:**
1. Adding validation for missing country data
2. Including more countries for comprehensive testing
3. Adding probabilistic population estimates

The implementation correctly fulfills all specified requirements with proper arithmetic handling and constraint checking. The test cases adequately verify the core functionality with representative country pairs across different density ranges.
