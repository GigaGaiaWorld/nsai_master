# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must find unique digit assignments where each letter represents a distinct digit (0-9) and the addition holds mathematically. The evaluation verifies correctness, identifies failures, and analyzes the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The program produced 10 solutions with probability 1.0000:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All solutions satisfy the constraints:
1. First digits (A,B,C) â‰  0
2. All digits are distinct
3. The addition AB + BCD = CDE holds mathematically

## Failure Localization
No test failures occurred. All predicates function correctly:
- `digit/1` (lines 2-6) defines valid digits
- `leftdigit/1` (line 8) enforces first-digit constraint
- `all_different/1` (lines 10-13) ensures uniqueness
- `sumdigit/5` (lines 15-19) correctly models column addition

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
- Logical correctness: All constraints are properly implemented
- Recursive termination: `all_different/1` terminates as list shrinks each recursion
- No probabilistic facts/negations used (pure logical solution)

**DeepProbLog Analysis:**
- **DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) present

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct constraint satisfaction
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (pure logical solution)
3. Neural network integration: Not required/implemented

**Edge Cases Considered:**
- First-digit zero constraint handled by `leftdigit/1`
- Digit uniqueness enforced via `all_different/1`
- Carry propagation correctly modeled in `sumdigit/5`

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add probabilistic constraints for alternative puzzle variations
2. Include input validation for non-list inputs
3. Optimize digit selection order for performance
