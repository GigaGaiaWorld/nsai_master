# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of constraints involving nationalities, pets, drinks, and other attributes. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness and completeness of the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned a single solution with probability 1.0000:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The solution satisfies all 15 constraints specified in the puzzle:
1. Englishman in the red house
2. Spaniard owns the dog
3. Coffee in green house
4. Ukrainian drinks tea
5. Green house immediately to right of ivory
6. Snails eater owns Winstons
7. Kools in yellow house
8. Milk in middle house
9. Norwegian in first house
10. Chesterfields next to fox
11. Kools next to horse
12. Lucky Strikes drinker has orange juice
13. Japanese smokes Parliaments
14. Norwegian next to blue house
15. Zebra and water drinker correctly identified

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and support the main puzzle constraints.

## Root Cause Analysis
In this classical ProbLog scenario (without probabilistic facts):
1. **Logical Correctness**: All constraints are properly implemented through logical conjunctions
2. **Recursive Termination**: Helper predicates terminate properly:
   - `my_member/2` terminates when list is empty
   - `right_of/3` terminates when list has <2 elements
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: Not applicable in this purely logical puzzle
4. **DeepProbLog Features**: DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly solves the logical puzzle
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not utilized (pure logical solution)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable

Edge cases considered:
- List boundaries handled in recursive predicates
- Position constraints (right_of/next_to) work at list edges
- All attributes are properly constrained to prevent ambiguity
