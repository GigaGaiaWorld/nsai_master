<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a probabilistic head probability of 0.8. The program counts successful heads outcomes (SC) through recursive processing of CNT coins, accumulating the final result in S. The evaluation focuses on syntax correctness, logical flow, and probabilistic computation.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with a syntax error:
```
Unmatched character '(' at 7:3
```
No queries could be executed due to this compilation error. The program failed before reaching any probabilistic computation or query evaluation stage.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate between lines 7-14. The specific issues are:
1. Missing closing parenthesis for the `if/3` construct
2. Missing closing parenthesis for the entire predicate body
3. Improper structure of the conditional logic block

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary failure stems from syntactic rather than logical issues:
1. **Classical ProbLog**: The recursive structure is conceptually correct (decrementing CNT until 0), but the implementation is syntactically invalid.
2. **Probabilistic Aspect**: The probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).` is correctly defined, but never reached due to earlier syntax errors.
3. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration features (nn/3, tensor) are used in this code.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not achieved (syntax error)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not reached
   - Neural integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0).` is correctly defined
   - Recursive depth is controlled by CNT parameter
   - Missing error handling for negative CNT values

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unmatched parentheses in if/3 construct | Compilation failure | Add missing closing parentheses |
| 2 | Improper predicate termination | Syntax error | Ensure all predicates end with proper punctuation |
| 3 | No negative CNT handling | Potential runtime error | Add guard clause for CNT < 0 |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```problog
PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).

coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    if(coin(CNT),
        (NewSC is SC + 1,
         NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT)),
        (NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(SC,S,NewCNT))
    ).

total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).
```

The corrected version adds proper closing parentheses and maintains the original logic while being syntactically valid. After correction, the program should properly compute the probabilistic count of heads in 4 coin tosses with P(heads)=0.8.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
