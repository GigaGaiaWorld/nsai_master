# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Program

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to model a series of coin tosses. The program should recursively process 4 coin tosses (CNT=4), count successful heads (SC), and accumulate the total count in S. Each coin has an 80% probability of landing heads (defined by `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8)`).

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with an error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
```
No queries returned successful results due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate (lines 8-16) where the if-then-else construct (`->/2`) is used. ProbLog doesn't natively support the standard Prolog if-then-else syntax without proper configuration.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The recursive logic is conceptually correct (decrementing CNT, conditionally incrementing SC), but uses incompatible syntax.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: The program attempts to use probabilistic facts (80% heads) but fails before probability calculations can occur.
3. **Syntax Issue**: ProbLog requires special handling of control structures. The `->/2` operator needs to be either:
   - Replaced with ProbLog's `if/3` construct
   - Preceded by proper declarations

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not achieved (compilation error)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not achieved (compilation error)
   - Neural integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined
   - Recursive depth is limited (CNT=4), so performance isn't a concern
   - No list handling required in this implementation

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid if-then-else syntax | Complete failure | Replace `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` with ProbLog's `if(Condition, Then, Else)` |
| 2 | Missing ProbLog control structure declarations | Compilation failure | Add `:- use_module(library(prob_meta)).` at start |

## Recommended Fix
```problog
:- use_module(library(prob_meta)).

PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).

coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    if(coin(CNT),
        (NewSC is SC + 1,
         NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT)),
        (NewCNT is CNT - 1,
         coins_r(SC,S,NewCNT))).

total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).
```

The corrected version uses ProbLog's native `if/3` predicate and includes the necessary library declaration. This should properly handle the probabilistic reasoning while maintaining the intended recursive counting behavior.
