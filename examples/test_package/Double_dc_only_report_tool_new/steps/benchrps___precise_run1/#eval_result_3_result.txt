  "ErrorSummary": "Malformed if-then-else syntax in determine_winner predicate causing compilation error",
  "SuggestedFix": "Correct the syntax of the conditional statement in determine_winner/3 by properly formatting the if-then-else construct and ensuring the predicate is complete. The corrected version should be: determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; Winner = draw).",
