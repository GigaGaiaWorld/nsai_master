# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The code should correctly calculate round results, compute scores, and determine the overall winner.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered a critical error during testing:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed to execute due to a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (cut off mid-implementation)
2. Malformed if-then-else construct in the provided code block
3. Missing proper predicate termination

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues are:
1. **Syntax Error**: The `determine_winner` predicate is improperly defined with a cut-off implementation and malformed conditional (->/2 operator)
2. **Logical Structure**: While the basic game rules (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`) are correctly defined, the scoring mechanism cannot be properly tested due to the predicate definition error
3. **Termination**: The recursive predicates `play/3` and `compute_score/2` appear logically correct but cannot be verified due to the main predicate failure

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (basic rules work but main predicate fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts)
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Uneven move lists would cause failure
   - Invalid moves not filtered

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete `determine_winner` predicate | Complete failure | Finish implementation with proper if-then-else syntax |
| 2 | Malformed conditional | Syntax error | Use proper Prolog conditional structure |
| 3 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation before processing |

## Corrected Implementation
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The evaluation reveals that while the core game logic is sound, the critical `determine_winner` predicate contains syntax errors preventing proper execution. Correcting the predicate definition and adding input validation would resolve the issues.
