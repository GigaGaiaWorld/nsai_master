# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on the correctness of game logic, score computation, and winner determination. The analysis covers classical Prolog reasoning aspects and verifies the implementation against test cases.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
This error occurred when executing the query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`. No successful test results were obtained due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error originates from line 41 in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically in the conditional statement:
```prolog
(Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; Winner = draw)
```
The parser fails to properly interpret the conditional operator sequence, suggesting either a syntax error or missing parentheses.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The conditional statements in Prolog require proper grouping with parentheses when chained.
2. **Logical Correctness**: The core game logic (move/1, beats/2, result/3) appears sound for classical reasoning.
3. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases and recursive cases.
4. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation (pure classical Prolog).
5. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration features (nn/3, tensor/...) are used.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
   - Neural integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Uneven move lists would cause failure
   - No input validation for valid moves

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in conditional | Fails to compile | Rewrite with proper parentheses: `(Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; (Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; Winner = draw))` |
| 2 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation in play/3 predicate |
| 3 | Uneven lists handling | Potential failure | Add length check or pad with default moves |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (   Score > 0 -> Winner = player1
    ;   Score < 0 -> Winner = player2
    ;   Winner = draw
    ).
```

The implementation requires proper syntax correction in the conditional statement and would benefit from additional input validation, but the core game logic demonstrates sound classical Prolog reasoning principles.
