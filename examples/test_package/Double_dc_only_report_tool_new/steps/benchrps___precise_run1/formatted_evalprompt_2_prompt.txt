<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The code should correctly calculate round results, compute scores, and determine the overall winner.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered a critical error during testing:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed to execute due to a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (cut off mid-implementation)
2. Malformed if-then-else construct in the provided code block
3. Missing proper predicate termination

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues are:
1. **Syntax Error**: The `determine_winner` predicate is improperly defined with a cut-off implementation and malformed conditional (->/2 operator)
2. **Logical Structure**: While the basic game rules (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`) are correctly defined, the scoring mechanism cannot be properly tested due to the predicate definition error
3. **Termination**: The recursive predicates `play/3` and `compute_score/2` appear logically correct but cannot be verified due to the main predicate failure

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (basic rules work but main predicate fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts)
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Uneven move lists would cause failure
   - Invalid moves not filtered

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete `determine_winner` predicate | Complete failure | Finish implementation with proper if-then-else syntax |
| 2 | Malformed conditional | Syntax error | Use proper Prolog conditional structure |
| 3 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation before processing |

## Corrected Implementation
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The evaluation reveals that while the core game logic is sound, the critical `determine_winner` predicate contains syntax errors preventing proper execution. Correcting the predicate definition and adding input validation would resolve the issues.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
