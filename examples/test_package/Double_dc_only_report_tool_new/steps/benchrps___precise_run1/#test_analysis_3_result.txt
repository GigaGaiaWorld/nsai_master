# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The program should determine the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, predicate definitions, and proper handling of game outcomes.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
No tests passed due to this compilation error preventing execution.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate (line 41) where the if-then-else construct (`->/2`) is improperly formatted. The predicate is incomplete in the main code block and appears to have a syntax error in the conditional logic.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The core game logic (move/1, beats/2, result/3) is correctly defined and follows rock-paper-scissors rules.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The play/3 and compute_score/2 predicates have proper base cases for recursion.
3. **Main Predicate Issue**: The `determine_winner/3` predicate is malformed with incorrect syntax for the conditional statement and appears truncated in the main code.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: 
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core rules work but main predicate fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts/rules)
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty move lists would work correctly based on play/3 definition
   - Invalid moves would fail silently (no input validation)
   - Non-list inputs would cause type errors

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed if-then-else in determine_winner | Prevents program execution | Fix syntax and complete the predicate |
| 2 | Truncated determine_winner in main code | Missing functionality | Use the complete version from Langda block |
| 3 | No input validation | Could accept invalid moves | Add move/1 checks in play/3 |

## Corrected Code Solution
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The evaluation reveals that while the core game logic is sound, the main predicate implementation contains critical syntax errors that prevent proper execution. The solution requires proper formatting of the conditional statement and completion of the predicate definition.
