<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The program should determine the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, predicate definitions, and proper handling of game outcomes.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
No tests passed due to this compilation error preventing execution.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate (line 41) where the if-then-else construct (`->/2`) is improperly formatted. The predicate is incomplete in the main code block and appears to have a syntax error in the conditional logic.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The core game logic (move/1, beats/2, result/3) is correctly defined and follows rock-paper-scissors rules.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The play/3 and compute_score/2 predicates have proper base cases for recursion.
3. **Main Predicate Issue**: The `determine_winner/3` predicate is malformed with incorrect syntax for the conditional statement and appears truncated in the main code.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: 
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core rules work but main predicate fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts/rules)
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty move lists would work correctly based on play/3 definition
   - Invalid moves would fail silently (no input validation)
   - Non-list inputs would cause type errors

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed if-then-else in determine_winner | Prevents program execution | Fix syntax and complete the predicate |
| 2 | Truncated determine_winner in main code | Missing functionality | Use the complete version from Langda block |
| 3 | No input validation | Could accept invalid moves | Add move/1 checks in play/3 |

## Corrected Code Solution
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The evaluation reveals that while the core game logic is sound, the main predicate implementation contains critical syntax errors that prevent proper execution. The solution requires proper formatting of the conditional statement and completion of the predicate definition.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
