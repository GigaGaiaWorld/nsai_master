# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under wind conditions using probabilistic actuators, with safety checks for overrun exceptions. The purpose is to verify correct probabilistic reasoning and classical logic implementation.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries executed successfully with the following probability results:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
- goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
- goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
- goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
- goal_reached(5) = 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for goal_reached as expected, while overrun_exception probabilities remain low but non-zero after the first step.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
- `flap_position/2` (lines 12-14) correctly implements legal position checking
- `overrun_exception/1` (lines 16-18) properly detects illegal positions
- `goal_reached/1` (lines 20-22) accurately checks goal achievement
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (lines 25-34) correctly computes new positions

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split) are correctly implemented
2. Wind effect distributions properly condition on wind strength
3. Probability calculations follow standard rules:
   - P(¬legal_position) = 1-P(legal_position)
   - Joint probabilities correctly computed for actuator+wind combinations
4. Recursive termination is guaranteed by the time-bound query (T ≤ 5)

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation (no neural network integration).

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for position validation and goal checking
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly models actuator selection and wind effects
- Neural integration: Not required for this scenario

**Edge Cases Verified:**
- Initial position (6) is legal
- Goal position (4) is legal
- Wind effects can push positions beyond boundaries (handled by overrun)
- Time-bound queries prevent infinite recursion

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add validation for actuator strength values
2. Include bounds checking for wind effect ranges
3. Consider adding visualization of position probabilities over time

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | All requirements met |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Consider adding input validation |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Could extend with DeepProbLog for wind prediction |

The implementation correctly models the aircraft flap control system with proper probabilistic reasoning and safety checks. The decreasing probability of reaching the goal over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty from wind effects and actuator choices, while the low but present overrun probabilities demonstrate proper handling of edge cases.
