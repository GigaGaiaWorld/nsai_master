# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic for this safety-critical system.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries executed successfully with the following probability results:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1): 0.2625
- goal_reached(2): 0.1873
- goal_reached(3): 0.1269
- goal_reached(4): 0.0841
- goal_reached(5): 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1): 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2): 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3): 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4): 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5): 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for goal_reached as expected, and overrun_exception probabilities remain low but non-zero after the first step.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Goal checking (line 12-14)
2. Actuator selection and strength calculation (line 24-26)
3. Direction calculation (line 27-28)
4. Wind effect integration (line 29)
5. Position calculation (line 30)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented:
- Actuator selection follows the 50/50 distribution (line 5)
- Wind strength probabilities properly cascade (lines 7-9)
- Negative outcomes (overrun) correctly computed via negation (line 11)
- All probability rules obey P(¬A)=1−P(A) principle

The classical logic aspects are sound:
- Recursive position calculation terminates via Time > 0 check (line 10)
- Goal checking prevents unnecessary moves (line 12)
- Legal position validation works (line 2, 10)

**DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation (no neural network integration).

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
- Classical reasoning (goal checking, position validation)
- Probabilistic reasoning (actuator selection, wind effects)

Edge cases properly handled:
- Initial position validation (line 2)
- Time boundary checks (line 10, 20)
- Illegal position detection (line 11)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and robust, with proper handling of both probabilistic and deterministic aspects of the flap control system. The decreasing probability of reaching the goal over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty from actuator selection and wind effects.
