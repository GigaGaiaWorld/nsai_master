# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Problog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program that queries population and area data to find countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates densities from population (in 100,000s) and area (in 1,000 square miles) data, then identifies pairs where one country's density is greater than another's but within a 5% margin (20*D1 < 21*D2).

## Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful query results:
```
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly identify country pairs where the density ratio falls between 1.0 and 1.05, as specified by the query conditions.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates function as intended:
- `density/2` (lines 12-15) correctly calculates population density
- `query_pop/1` (lines 6-11) properly implements the comparison logic
- All population and area facts are correctly defined

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The density calculation `D is (P*100)//A` and comparison logic `D1 > D2, T1 is 20*D1, T2 is 21*D2, T1 < T2` are mathematically sound
2. **Termination**: The program terminates properly as it contains no recursive predicates
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: The results show probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic facts. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
4. **DeepProbLog**: The feature is not used in this program

## Overall Analysis
The program meets its functional requirements for classical reasoning about population densities:
1. **Correctness**: All test cases verify the program works as intended
2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Handles integer division in density calculation
   - Properly compares densities with the specified ratio
   - Includes a comprehensive set of country data
3. **Limitations**:
   - Uses integer division which may lose precision
   - Doesn't handle missing data cases
   - No probabilistic reasoning demonstrated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and meets its specified requirements. For extended functionality, consider adding probabilistic population estimates or floating-point density calculations for greater precision.
