# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant selects a door (always door 1 in this implementation), the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the contestant can choose to either keep their original selection or switch to the remaining unopened door. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning correctly calculates the 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice versus the 2/3 chance by switching.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Equal 1/3 probability distribution for the prize behind each door
2. Certainty of selecting door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
- The random prize placement (lines 1-2)
- Host behavior rules (lines 4-15)
- Win condition predicates (lines 16-21)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Prize distribution uses proper disjoint probabilities summing to 1
2. Host behavior rules correctly implement:
   - Random selection between two empty doors (hash E2FA63E7)
   - Certain selection when only one empty door remains (hash B4161B21)
3. Win conditions properly account for:
   - `win_keep`: Probability equals prize being behind initially selected door
   - `win_switch`: Probability equals prize being behind the other unopened door

The implementation correctly applies probabilistic rules:
- `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` through negation as failure
- Proper handling of mutually exclusive cases through disjoint probabilities

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets functional requirements for:
- Classical reasoning: Correct handling of door selection and prize placement
- Probabilistic reasoning: Accurate probability calculations for both strategies

Edge cases properly handled:
- Host behavior covers both scenarios (one or two available doors to open)
- Door numbering and selection constraints prevent invalid cases
- Probability distributions remain properly normalized

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | None    | None   | None       |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic reasoning. All test cases pass as expected, demonstrating the well-known probability distribution where switching doors doubles the chances of winning. The code is concise yet covers all necessary scenarios without edge case vulnerabilities.
