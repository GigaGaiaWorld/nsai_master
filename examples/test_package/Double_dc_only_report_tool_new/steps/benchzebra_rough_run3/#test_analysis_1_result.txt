# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the solution and ensure all constraints are properly enforced through predicate definitions.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned a single solution with probability 1.0000:
```
[house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
 house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
 house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
 house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
 house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution correctly satisfies all puzzle constraints:
1. Nationality, color, drink, smoke, and pet assignments match all given clues
2. Spatial relationships (right_of, next_to) are properly enforced
3. All helper predicates (my_member, next_to, right_of) function as intended

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the implementation. All expansion predicates are correctly defined:
- `my_member/2` (lines 1-2) handles list membership
- `next_to/3` (lines 1-2) checks adjacency through `right_of/3`
- `right_of/3` (lines 1-2) verifies relative position

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Aspects
1. **Logical Correctness**: All puzzle constraints are properly encoded as predicates
2. **Recursive Termination**: 
   - `my_member` and `right_of` properly terminate on empty lists
   - Recursion depth is limited to house count (5)

### Probabilistic Aspects
- Pure logical program (no probabilistic facts)
- No probabilistic operations needed (¬A, A⇒B)
- All solutions have probability 1.0 (deterministic solution)

### DeepProbLog Integration
**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network components (`nn/3`, `tensor`) present

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully satisfied - correct solution found
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (deterministic problem)
3. **Neural Integration**: Not required

### Edge Cases Verified
1. **List Handling**: All predicates properly handle 5-element house list
2. **Position Constraints**: `right_of` and `next_to` work at list boundaries
3. **Member Checking**: `my_member` finds all required attributes

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with proper constraint handling and predicate definitions. No modifications are recommended for the current requirements.
