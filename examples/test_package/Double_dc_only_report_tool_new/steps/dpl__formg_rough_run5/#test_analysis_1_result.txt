# Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against functional requirements and identify potential edge cases or logical errors.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
Result:
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with 100% probability, matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. Comparison operations during merging

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical Prolog terms:
1. **Recursive termination**: Properly handles base cases (lines 1-2) and ensures recursive calls (lines 5-8) reduce problem size
2. **Splitting logic**: The `split/3` predicate (lines 9-12) correctly divides lists into halves
3. **Merging logic**: The `merge/3` predicate (lines 13-19) properly combines sorted sublists

Probabilistic aspects:
- The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets classical reasoning requirements:
1. Correctly implements the merge sort algorithm
2. Handles standard list sorting cases
3. Maintains logical consistency throughout recursive operations

Edge case considerations:
1. **Non-list input**: Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)
2. **Empty list**: Properly handled by first clause
3. **Single-element list**: Properly handled by second clause
4. **Performance**: Recursive depth is logarithmic to input size
5. **Duplicate elements**: Properly handled by merge comparison (using `=<` and `>`)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | N/A |

The implementation is correct for the tested case and appears robust for standard sorting scenarios. For production use, additional edge case testing (particularly for non-list inputs) would be recommended. The absence of probabilistic features or neural network integration makes this a purely classical Prolog implementation.
