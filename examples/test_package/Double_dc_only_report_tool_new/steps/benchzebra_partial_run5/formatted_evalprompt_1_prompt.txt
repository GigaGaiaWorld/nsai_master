</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on multiple constraints involving nationalities, pets, drinks, and cigarette brands.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows a single successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The solution satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as evidenced by the correct arrangement of houses with all attributes matching the requirements.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All tagged code blocks (identified by their hash values) correctly implement their respective requirements:

1. `769EF692`: Red house owned by English - Correct
2. `430FAC43`: Spanish owns dog - Correct
3. `F5F641BC`: Green house drinks coffee - Correct
4. `3127CC36`: Snail owner smokes Winstons - Correct
5. `4AC08146`: Middle house drinks milk - Correct
6. `D316E87D`: Norwegian next to blue house - Correct
7. `CFE3727A`: Zebra exists - Correct
8. `87D90A3D`: Water drinker exists - Correct

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical reasoning:
1. **Classical Prolog aspects**: All predicates terminate properly due to bounded recursion (5 houses) and correct base cases in `right_of/3` and `next_to/3`.
2. **Probabilistic aspects**: The solution shows deterministic (1.0000 probability) results, appropriate for this puzzle. No probabilistic facts or rules were needed.
3. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (no neural network integration required).

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: All constraints are correctly implemented through logical predicates.
2. **Edge cases handled**: 
   - Fixed-length list (5 houses) prevents infinite recursion
   - Positional constraints (right_of, next_to) work correctly
   - All attribute combinations are properly constrained

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |

The solution is robust and correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints satisfied. No modifications are needed to the current implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
