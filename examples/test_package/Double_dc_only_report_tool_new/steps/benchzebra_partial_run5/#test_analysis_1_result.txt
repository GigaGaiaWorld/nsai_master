# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on multiple constraints involving nationalities, pets, drinks, and cigarette brands.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows a single successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The solution satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as evidenced by the correct arrangement of houses with all attributes matching the requirements.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All tagged code blocks (identified by their hash values) correctly implement their respective requirements:

1. `769EF692`: Red house owned by English - Correct
2. `430FAC43`: Spanish owns dog - Correct
3. `F5F641BC`: Green house drinks coffee - Correct
4. `3127CC36`: Snail owner smokes Winstons - Correct
5. `4AC08146`: Middle house drinks milk - Correct
6. `D316E87D`: Norwegian next to blue house - Correct
7. `CFE3727A`: Zebra exists - Correct
8. `87D90A3D`: Water drinker exists - Correct

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical reasoning:
1. **Classical Prolog aspects**: All predicates terminate properly due to bounded recursion (5 houses) and correct base cases in `right_of/3` and `next_to/3`.
2. **Probabilistic aspects**: The solution shows deterministic (1.0000 probability) results, appropriate for this puzzle. No probabilistic facts or rules were needed.
3. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (no neural network integration required).

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: All constraints are correctly implemented through logical predicates.
2. **Edge cases handled**: 
   - Fixed-length list (5 houses) prevents infinite recursion
   - Positional constraints (right_of, next_to) work correctly
   - All attribute combinations are properly constrained

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |

The solution is robust and correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints satisfied. No modifications are needed to the current implementation.
