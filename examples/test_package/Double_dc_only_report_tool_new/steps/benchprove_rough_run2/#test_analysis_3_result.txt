# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The analysis focuses on verifying test results, identifying failures, analyzing root causes, and assessing overall functionality against requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 1.0000 (success)
2. `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 0.0000 (failure)
3. `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 0.0000 (failure)
4. `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` = 0.0000 (failure)
5. `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` = 0.0000 (failure)

Only 1 out of 5 tests passed successfully.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))`
   - Error: Missing `opposite/1` predicate definition
   - Location: Entire predicate missing

2. **Failed Query**: `prove(expand(double(3),6))`
   - Error: `expand/2` predicate exists but query fails
   - Location: Line with `expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.`
   - Issue: Meta-interpreter doesn't properly handle arithmetic expressions

3. **Failed Query**: `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))`
   - Error: Missing `includes/2` predicate definition
   - Location: Entire predicate missing

4. **Failed Query**: `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))`
   - Error: Missing `extend/3` predicate definition
   - Location: Entire predicate missing

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Issues**:
   - Missing predicate implementations for required functionality
   - Arithmetic evaluation in `expand/2` not properly handled by meta-interpreter
   - No implementation of negation handling for `opposite/1`

2. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - The successful `implies/2` test shows correct handling of implication (P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)+P(A∧B))
   - Missing probabilistic negation handling (P(¬A)=1−P(A)) for `opposite/1`

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Basic meta-interpreter works for simple cases
   - `implies/2` implementation is correct
   - Classical reasoning partially works

2. **Requirements Not Met**:
   - Missing predicates: `opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`
   - Arithmetic handling incomplete
   - Probabilistic negation not implemented
   - No neural network integration

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Deep recursion performance untested
   - Undefined `expand/2` cases would fail
   - Type checking missing

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `opposite/1` | Cannot handle negation | Implement with probabilistic negation |
| 2 | `expand/2` arithmetic failure | Numeric operations fail | Modify meta-interpreter to handle `is/2` |
| 3 | Missing `includes/2` | List membership check fails | Implement using `member/2` |
| 4 | Missing `extend/3` | List extension fails | Implement list prepend operation |
| 5 | Missing `refute/1` | Cannot disprove goals | Implement negation handling |

**Word Count**: 498 words

The evaluation reveals significant gaps in implementation, particularly in handling the required extended predicates. The meta-interpreter core works for simple cases but needs substantial expansion to meet all requirements. Priority should be given to implementing missing predicates and proper arithmetic handling.
