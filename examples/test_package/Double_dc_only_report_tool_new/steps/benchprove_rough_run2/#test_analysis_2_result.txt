# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The analysis focuses on verifying test results, identifying failures, analyzing root causes, and assessing overall functionality against requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show mixed success:
- **Passed Query**: `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 1.0000`
- **Failed Queries**:
  - `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000` (expected success)
  - `prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000` (expected success)
  - `prove(includes([a,b,c],b)) = 0.0000` (expected success)
  - `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2])) = 0.0000` (expected success)

## Failure Localization
1. **opposite/1**: Missing predicate definition (required by requirements)
2. **expand/2**: Defined but not properly integrated into prove/1 (lines 15-16)
3. **includes/2**: Missing predicate definition (required by requirements)
4. **extend/3**: Missing predicate definition (required by requirements)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The `implies/2` implementation (hash 3F5BA02C) correctly follows `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`
   - Missing definitions for required predicates violate classical logic completeness

2. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - Correct handling of `implies` shows proper probabilistic reasoning
   - Missing negation handling for `opposite/1` breaks probability rules

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used" - no neural network integration present

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (missing predicates)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Partially met (only `implies` works)
- Neural network: Not applicable

**Edge Cases**:
- Undefined `expand/2` cases fail silently
- Non-list inputs not handled for list operations
- Recursive performance untested for deep structures

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing opposite/1 | Fails opposite queries | Implement negation handling |
| 2 | Missing includes/2 | Fails membership tests | Implement list membership check |
| 3 | Missing extend/3 | Fails list extension | Implement list prepend operation |
| 4 | Unintegrated expand/2 | Fails expansion proofs | Add prove(expand(A,B)) :- expand(A,B) rule |

**Critical Missing Code**:
```prolog
% Required missing predicates
prove(opposite(A)) :- \+ prove(A).
prove(includes(List,Elem)) :- member(Elem,List).
prove(extend(List,Elem,NewList)) :- NewList = [Elem|List].
prove(expand(A,B)) :- expand(A,B).
```

The evaluation reveals partial implementation of requirements, with core logic working but several key predicates missing. Completing the missing definitions would bring the implementation to full functionality.
