# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates results between players, computes scores, and determines the winner. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, test results, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 winning with:
- Round 1: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 2: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 3: rock beats scissor (player1 wins)
Final score: -1 (player2 wins)

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
1. `move/1` (lines 1-5) - Correctly defines all three gestures
2. `beats/2` (lines 7-10) - Correctly defines all win-lose relationships
3. `result/3` (lines 13-21) - Correctly handles draw, win, and lose scenarios
4. `play/3` and `compute_score/2` (lines 24-35) - Correct recursive implementation

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Problog Analysis:
- **Logical Correctness:** All rules properly implement game logic
- **Recursive Termination:** Base cases exist for both `play/3` (empty list) and `compute_score/2` (empty list)
- **Edge Cases:** Handles all gesture combinations correctly

### Probabilistic Analysis:
- No probabilistic facts or rules used (pure logical implementation)
- DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully implemented with correct game rules and result calculation
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not required/used in this implementation
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog feature not required)

### Edge Cases Considered:
1. **Undefined Inputs:** Non-move inputs would fail (expected behavior)
2. **List Length Mismatch:** Not explicitly handled but would fail (could add validation)
3. **Deep Recursion:** Not a concern for typical game lengths
4. **Non-list Input:** Would cause type errors (could add input validation)

The implementation correctly handles the rock-paper-scissors game logic with proper recursive processing of move lists. While the current implementation meets all basic requirements, adding input validation for list length matching and non-move inputs could improve robustness. The absence of probabilistic features or neural network integration is appropriate for this deterministic game implementation.
