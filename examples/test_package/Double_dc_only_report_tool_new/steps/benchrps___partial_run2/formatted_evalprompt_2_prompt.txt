</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates results between players, computes scores, and determines the winner. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, test results, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 winning with:
- Round 1: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 2: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 3: rock beats scissor (player1 wins)
Final score: -1 (player2 wins)

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
1. `move/1` (lines 1-5) - Correctly defines all three gestures
2. `beats/2` (lines 7-10) - Correctly defines all win-lose relationships
3. `result/3` (lines 13-21) - Correctly handles draw, win, and lose scenarios
4. `play/3` and `compute_score/2` (lines 24-35) - Correct recursive implementation

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Problog Analysis:
- **Logical Correctness:** All rules properly implement game logic
- **Recursive Termination:** Base cases exist for both `play/3` (empty list) and `compute_score/2` (empty list)
- **Edge Cases:** Handles all gesture combinations correctly

### Probabilistic Analysis:
- No probabilistic facts or rules used (pure logical implementation)
- DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully implemented with correct game rules and result calculation
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not required/used in this implementation
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog feature not required)

### Edge Cases Considered:
1. **Undefined Inputs:** Non-move inputs would fail (expected behavior)
2. **List Length Mismatch:** Not explicitly handled but would fail (could add validation)
3. **Deep Recursion:** Not a concern for typical game lengths
4. **Non-list Input:** Would cause type errors (could add input validation)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation correctly handles the rock-paper-scissors game logic with proper recursive processing of move lists. While the current implementation meets all basic requirements, adding input validation for list length matching and non-move inputs could improve robustness. The absence of probabilistic features or neural network integration is appropriate for this deterministic game implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
