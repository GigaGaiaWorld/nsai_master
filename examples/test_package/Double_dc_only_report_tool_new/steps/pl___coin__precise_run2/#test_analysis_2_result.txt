# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that simulates tossing multiple biased coins (with 0.8 probability of heads) and counts the number of successful heads. The program uses recursive counting to accumulate results from 4 coin tosses. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both the logical implementation and probabilistic calculations.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 heads in 4 tosses:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results correctly match the expected binomial distribution for 4 trials with p=0.8:
- P(4) = 0.8⁴ = 0.4096
- P(3) = 4 × 0.8³ × 0.2 = 0.4096
- P(2) = 6 × 0.8² × 0.2² = 0.1536
- P(1) = 4 × 0.8 × 0.2³ = 0.0256
- P(0) = 0.2⁴ = 0.0016

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly:
1. Handles the base case (line 3)
2. Properly decrements the counter (line 9)
3. Accurately accumulates successes (lines 6-7)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic calculations are mathematically correct:
1. The coin bias is properly defined as `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` with `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8)`
2. The recursive counting correctly combines probabilities through:
   - Disjunction (`;` operator) for head/tail cases
   - Conjunction (implicit `,` operator) for sequential trials
3. The negation case `\+ coin(CNT)` properly computes P(¬A) = 1-0.8 = 0.2

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - The solution uses only basic ProbLog without neural network integration.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct recursive counting logic
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurate probability calculations
- **Edge cases**: Properly handles all countdown cases (4 to 0)

Potential improvements:
1. Adding input validation for negative CNT values
2. Making the coin bias parameter configurable
3. Adding tail recursion optimization
