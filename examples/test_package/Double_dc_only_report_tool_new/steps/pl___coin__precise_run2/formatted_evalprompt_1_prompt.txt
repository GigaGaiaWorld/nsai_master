problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses and count successful outcomes (heads). The program uses recursive counting with probabilistic facts to model coin flips. The evaluation focuses on correctness, termination, and proper handling of probabilistic operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12
```
No queries were successfully executed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate at line 7, specifically with the implication operator `->` used in the conditional statement. ProbLog doesn't natively support the Prolog implication operator in this context.

Problematic code block:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 (coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC is SC),  % Line 7 - Error location
 CNT1 is CNT - 1,
 coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The recursive structure is conceptually sound but uses Prolog's control flow operator (`->`) which isn't directly supported in ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning context.

2. **Probabilistic Compliance**: The program attempts to use a deterministic control structure (`->`) with probabilistic facts, which violates ProbLog's evaluation model. ProbLog requires probabilistic conditions to be expressed through proper probabilistic queries.

3. **Recursive Termination**: The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined and would properly terminate the recursion if the predicate were syntactically valid.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not properly implemented due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Attempted but incorrectly expressed
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The counter decrement could potentially underflow if called with negative CNT
   - The coin/1 predicate's probabilistic nature isn't properly integrated with the counting logic
   - No handling for cases where CNT doesn't properly decrease to 0

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid use of `->` operator | Compilation failure | Replace with `if_then_else/3` or separate clauses |
| 2 | Probabilistic fact not properly queried | Incorrect probability calculation | Use `prob_query/1` or proper probabilistic conditions |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential underflow/errors | Add guard clauses for CNT range |

## Recommended Fix
```prolog
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT), NSC is SC + 1 ; \+ coin(CNT), NSC is SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

This revised version:
1. Removes the unsupported `->` operator
2. Properly handles the probabilistic condition
3. Maintains the same logical flow while being ProbLog-compliant

The evaluation concludes that while the program's intent is clear, it requires syntax adjustments to properly work within ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework. The core logic of counting successful coin flips is sound but needs proper probabilistic expression.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
