# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses and count successful outcomes (heads). The program uses recursive counting with probabilistic facts to model coin flips. The evaluation focuses on correctness, termination, and proper handling of probabilistic operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12
```
No queries were successfully executed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate at line 7, specifically with the implication operator `->` used in the conditional statement. ProbLog doesn't natively support the Prolog implication operator in this context.

Problematic code block:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 (coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC is SC),  % Line 7 - Error location
 CNT1 is CNT - 1,
 coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The recursive structure is conceptually sound but uses Prolog's control flow operator (`->`) which isn't directly supported in ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning context.

2. **Probabilistic Compliance**: The program attempts to use a deterministic control structure (`->`) with probabilistic facts, which violates ProbLog's evaluation model. ProbLog requires probabilistic conditions to be expressed through proper probabilistic queries.

3. **Recursive Termination**: The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined and would properly terminate the recursion if the predicate were syntactically valid.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not properly implemented due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Attempted but incorrectly expressed
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The counter decrement could potentially underflow if called with negative CNT
   - The coin/1 predicate's probabilistic nature isn't properly integrated with the counting logic
   - No handling for cases where CNT doesn't properly decrease to 0

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid use of `->` operator | Compilation failure | Replace with `if_then_else/3` or separate clauses |
| 2 | Probabilistic fact not properly queried | Incorrect probability calculation | Use `prob_query/1` or proper probabilistic conditions |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential underflow/errors | Add guard clauses for CNT range |

## Recommended Fix
```prolog
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT), NSC is SC + 1 ; \+ coin(CNT), NSC is SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

This revised version:
1. Removes the unsupported `->` operator
2. Properly handles the probabilistic condition
3. Maintains the same logical flow while being ProbLog-compliant

The evaluation concludes that while the program's intent is clear, it requires syntax adjustments to properly work within ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework. The core logic of counting successful coin flips is sound but needs proper probabilistic expression.
