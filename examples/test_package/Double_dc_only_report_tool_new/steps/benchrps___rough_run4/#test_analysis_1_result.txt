# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates outcomes between moves, and determines the winner of a series of moves. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and compliance with ProbLog requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:**
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
1. Game 1: rock vs paper → lose (player2 wins)
2. Game 2: rock vs paper → lose (player2 wins)
3. Game 3: rock vs scissor → win (player1 wins)
Final score: -1 (player2 wins) - Correct result

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following components were verified:
- Move definitions (lines 3-5)
- Beat relationships (lines 7-9)
- Outcome calculation (lines 14-16)
- Play sequence processing (lines 18-21)
- Score computation (lines 23-26)
- Winner determination (lines 27-32)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
1. Logical correctness:
   - All game rules properly implement rock-paper-scissors semantics
   - Recursive predicates (`play/3`, `compute_score/2`) have proper base cases
   - Termination is guaranteed as lists are processed element-wise

2. Probabilistic aspects:
   - No probabilistic facts are used in this implementation
   - The result probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic computation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

**Edge Case Verification:**
1. Empty lists: Correctly returns draw (score 0)
2. Uneven list lengths: Not handled (would cause failure)
3. Non-list inputs: Would cause type errors
4. Invalid moves: Would fail silently in `outcome/3`

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for game rules and outcome determination
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized in this implementation
- Neural network integration: Not required/implemented

**Improvement Suggestions:**
1. Add input validation for moves and list lengths
2. Consider probabilistic extension (e.g., weighted moves)
3. Add documentation for public predicates
4. Handle uneven list lengths gracefully

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Uneven list lengths not handled | Runtime failure | Add length check or pad shorter list |
| 2 | Invalid moves not validated | Silent failure | Add move validation predicate |
| 3 | No probabilistic extension | Limited functionality | Add move probability distributions |

The implementation correctly handles the basic rock-paper-scissors game logic and passed all provided test cases. While functionally correct for deterministic play, it could be enhanced with better input validation and potential probabilistic extensions.
