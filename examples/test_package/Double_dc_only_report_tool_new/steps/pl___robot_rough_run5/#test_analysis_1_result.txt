# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's key pickup scenario with probabilistic outcomes. The code handles actions like picking up keys, moving between locations, and dealing with slippery conditions. The purpose is to verify correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning.

## Test Results Summary
The program executed 2 queries with the following results:
1. `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` returned probability 0.4331
2. `at(_,_,s(s(s(0))))` returned multiple location probabilities:
   - Robot locations: loc2(0.9), loc1(0.09), loc0(0.01)
   - Key locations: loc2(0.567), loc1(0.433), loc0(0.0)

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results align with expected probabilistic behavior given the model's rules and probability distributions.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates are properly defined:
- Key carrying rules (lines 1-12) handle both pickup and retention cases
- Movement rules (lines 28-34) properly model successful/failed goto actions
- Slippery key handling (lines 14-26) correctly models probabilistic dropping

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. Negation probabilities: `P(¬drops) = 1-P(drops)` correctly implemented
2. Conjunction probabilities: `P(pickup ∧ at_location)` properly multiplied
3. Recursive cases (slippery state, carrying) all have proper base cases
4. Probability distributions sum to 1 for all mutually exclusive cases

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network integration present.

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models state transitions
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes joint probabilities
3. Edge cases handled:
   - Base cases for all recursive predicates
   - All possible action outcomes covered
   - Impossible states (key at loc0) correctly show 0 probability

Potential improvements:
1. Add validation for position existence
2. Consider adding max recursion depth
3. Could benefit from DeepProbLog for learning probabilities

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The code demonstrates correct implementation of probabilistic logic programming principles with proper handling of both success and failure cases for all actions. The test results validate the expected behavior under the defined probability distributions.
