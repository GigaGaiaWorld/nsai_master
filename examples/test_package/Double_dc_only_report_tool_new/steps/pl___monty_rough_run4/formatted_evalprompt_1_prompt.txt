</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, where a player selects a door behind which there may be a prize, and the host opens another door based on specific rules. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and implementation against the problem's requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation resulted in a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
  ...
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'find_available_doors/2' at 6:49
```

No queries could be successfully executed due to this fundamental error. The system failed before reaching any probability calculations.

## Failure Localization
The primary failure occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-49 in the code block), which attempts to call the undefined predicate `find_available_doors/2`. This predicate is crucial for implementing the two required clauses:
1. Random selection between two available doors
2. Forced selection when only one door is available

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation fails because:
1. **Missing Predicate**: The critical `find_available_doors/2` predicate is not defined, making the `open_door/1` rule unimplementable
2. **Logical Incompleteness**: The requirements specify two distinct cases for door opening, but neither is properly implemented
3. **Probabilistic Correctness**: While the prize distribution is correctly defined (1/3 probability for each door), the host's behavior rules cannot be evaluated

## Overall Analysis
The current implementation fails to meet functional requirements due to:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Incomplete implementation missing key predicates
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Prize distribution is correct but cannot be properly evaluated
3. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (not applicable to this problem)

Key edge cases not handled:
- Undefined behavior when trying to open a door
- No validation of door selection constraints
- Missing implementation of host's decision rules

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `find_available_doors/2` predicate | Complete failure of door opening logic | Implement predicate to find non-selected, non-prize doors |
| 2 | Incomplete `open_door/1` implementation | Host behavior rules not enforced | Add cases for random vs. forced door opening |
| 3 | Untested prize distribution | Cannot verify correct probabilities | Fix implementation to enable query testing |

```prolog
% Suggested fix outline
find_available_doors(Selected, Available) :-
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), \+ D=Selected), Available).

open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    find_available_doors(Selected, Available),
    (length(Available,2) -> random_select(Available, Door) ; Available=[Door]).
```

The implementation requires completion of the core logic before probabilistic queries can be properly evaluated. The current state prevents any meaningful probability calculations from being performed.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
