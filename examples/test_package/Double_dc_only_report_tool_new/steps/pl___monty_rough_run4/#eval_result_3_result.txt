{"HASH": "751033ED","ErrorSummary": "Missing proper definition of open_door/1 predicate causing UnknownClause error. The implementation fails to properly handle the two required cases for Monty's door opening behavior.","SuggestedFix": "1. Correct the syntax of the open_door/1 predicate definition (remove extra spaces before :-). 2. Ensure proper implementation of both cases: (a) when two available doors exist, choose randomly, and (b) when only one available door exists, choose it. 3. Verify proper integration with find_available_doors/2 helper predicate.","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
