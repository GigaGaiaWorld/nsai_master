# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, which simulates a game show scenario where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host then opens a non-selected, non-winning door, and the player can choose to keep their original selection or switch. The implementation should correctly model the probabilistic nature of the problem and the host's behavior.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition. The error message indicates an unmatched character '(' at position 8:95, suggesting improper predicate termination or structure.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Component**: `open_door/1` predicate
   - **Location**: Code block starting with `find_available_doors` and ending with `Available=[Door].`
   - **Error**: Syntax error due to improper predicate termination (missing closing parenthesis and period)
   - **Impact**: Prevents the entire program from executing

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**:
   - The `open_door/1` predicate is missing proper termination (final period)
   - The conditional structure is incorrectly formatted
   - The list unification `Available=[Door]` should be part of the conditional branch

2. **Probabilistic Correctness**:
   - The prize distribution (1/3 for each door) is correctly specified
   - The switching logic appears correct in principle but cannot be verified due to syntax error

3. **Classical Logic**:
   - The member/2 predicate is correctly defined for list membership
   - The select_door/1 fact is properly defined

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (basic predicates work but main logic fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not verifiable due to syntax error
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code doesn't handle cases where the selected door might be invalid
   - No input validation for door numbers
   - Recursion depth is minimal and not a concern here

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unmatched parenthesis in open_door/1 | Code cannot execute | Fix predicate syntax and termination |
| 2 | Improper conditional structure | Logical flow broken | Use proper if-then-else syntax |
| 3 | Missing final period | Parser error | Add proper predicate termination |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    find_available_doors(Selected, Available),
    (length(Available, 2) -> 
        random_member(Door, Available) 
    ; 
        Available=[Door]
    ).
```

The main issue is purely syntactic and can be resolved with proper formatting and termination of the `open_door/1` predicate. Once fixed, the probabilistic reasoning should correctly model the Monty Hall problem scenario.
