</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, which simulates a game show scenario where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host then opens a non-selected, non-winning door, and the player can choose to keep their original selection or switch. The implementation should correctly model the probabilistic nature of the problem and the host's behavior.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition. The error message indicates an unmatched character '(' at position 8:95, suggesting improper predicate termination or structure.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Component**: `open_door/1` predicate
   - **Location**: Code block starting with `find_available_doors` and ending with `Available=[Door].`
   - **Error**: Syntax error due to improper predicate termination (missing closing parenthesis and period)
   - **Impact**: Prevents the entire program from executing

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**:
   - The `open_door/1` predicate is missing proper termination (final period)
   - The conditional structure is incorrectly formatted
   - The list unification `Available=[Door]` should be part of the conditional branch

2. **Probabilistic Correctness**:
   - The prize distribution (1/3 for each door) is correctly specified
   - The switching logic appears correct in principle but cannot be verified due to syntax error

3. **Classical Logic**:
   - The member/2 predicate is correctly defined for list membership
   - The select_door/1 fact is properly defined

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (basic predicates work but main logic fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not verifiable due to syntax error
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code doesn't handle cases where the selected door might be invalid
   - No input validation for door numbers
   - Recursion depth is minimal and not a concern here

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unmatched parenthesis in open_door/1 | Code cannot execute | Fix predicate syntax and termination |
| 2 | Improper conditional structure | Logical flow broken | Use proper if-then-else syntax |
| 3 | Missing final period | Parser error | Add proper predicate termination |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    find_available_doors(Selected, Available),
    (length(Available, 2) -> 
        random_member(Door, Available) 
    ; 
        Available=[Door]
    ).
```

The main issue is purely syntactic and can be resolved with proper formatting and termination of the `open_door/1` predicate. Once fixed, the probabilistic reasoning should correctly model the Monty Hall problem scenario.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
