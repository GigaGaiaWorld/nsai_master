# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, Monty opens another door revealing no prize, and the player decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to problem requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:117
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error. The system cannot find the required clauses for proper execution.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate implementation (lines 8-117 in the original code). The system cannot find the necessary clauses to execute this predicate, which is central to the Monty Hall problem simulation.

Key problematic components:
1. Missing proper definition of `open_door/1` predicate
2. Potential issues with the `find_available_doors/2` helper predicate
3. The error suggests syntax or structural problems in the predicate definitions

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue stems from:
1. **Syntax Errors**: The predicate definitions may contain malformed syntax or incorrect operator usage
2. **Missing Clauses**: The system cannot find implementations for required predicates
3. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: While the prize distribution is correctly defined (1/3 probability for each door), the subsequent reasoning about door opening fails

Probabilistic rules compliance:
- Prize distribution correctly follows P(A)=1/3 for each door
- The negation and implication rules cannot be verified due to execution failure

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet functional requirements due to the compilation error. Key observations:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Not operational due to predicate definition issues
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Initial prize distribution is correct but cannot be verified in full scenario
3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Undefined behavior for invalid inputs
   - No handling for cases where all doors might have prizes (though impossible per problem definition)
   - No validation of door selection inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing/incorrect predicate definitions | Complete execution failure | Review and correct predicate syntax and structure |
| 2 | Unknown clause error in open_door/1 | Core functionality broken | Verify predicate arities and clause definitions |
| 3 | Untested edge cases | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation and edge case handling |

**Recommendations**:
1. Carefully review predicate definitions for syntax errors
2. Verify all required clauses are properly implemented
3. Add test cases for edge scenarios
4. Consider adding input validation for door numbers
5. Ensure proper probabilistic reasoning flow throughout all predicates

The implementation requires significant revision to address the compilation errors before probabilistic behavior can be properly evaluated. The current state prevents any meaningful query execution or probability calculation.
