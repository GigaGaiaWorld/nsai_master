# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, where a player selects a door behind which there may be a prize, and the host opens another door based on specific rules. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and implementation against the problem's requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation resulted in a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
  ...
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'find_available_doors/2' at 6:49
```

No queries could be successfully executed due to this fundamental error. The system failed before reaching any probability calculations.

## Failure Localization
The primary failure occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-49 in the code block), which attempts to call the undefined predicate `find_available_doors/2`. This predicate is crucial for implementing the two required clauses:
1. Random selection between two available doors
2. Forced selection when only one door is available

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation fails because:
1. **Missing Predicate**: The critical `find_available_doors/2` predicate is not defined, making the `open_door/1` rule unimplementable
2. **Logical Incompleteness**: The requirements specify two distinct cases for door opening, but neither is properly implemented
3. **Probabilistic Correctness**: While the prize distribution is correctly defined (1/3 probability for each door), the host's behavior rules cannot be evaluated

## Overall Analysis
The current implementation fails to meet functional requirements due to:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Incomplete implementation missing key predicates
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Prize distribution is correct but cannot be properly evaluated
3. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (not applicable to this problem)

Key edge cases not handled:
- Undefined behavior when trying to open a door
- No validation of door selection constraints
- Missing implementation of host's decision rules

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `find_available_doors/2` predicate | Complete failure of door opening logic | Implement predicate to find non-selected, non-prize doors |
| 2 | Incomplete `open_door/1` implementation | Host behavior rules not enforced | Add cases for random vs. forced door opening |
| 3 | Untested prize distribution | Cannot verify correct probabilities | Fix implementation to enable query testing |

```prolog
% Suggested fix outline
find_available_doors(Selected, Available) :-
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), \+ D=Selected), Available).

open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    find_available_doors(Selected, Available),
    (length(Available,2) -> random_select(Available, Door) ; Available=[Door]).
```

The implementation requires completion of the core logic before probabilistic queries can be properly evaluated. The current state prevents any meaningful probability calculations from being performed.
