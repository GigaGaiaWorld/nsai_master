# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes predicates for implication, negation, expansion, set inclusion, and list extension, along with example queries testing these features. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and compliance with ProbLog semantics.

## Test Results Summary
All 5 test queries returned successful results with probability 1.0000:
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 1.0000
2. `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 1.0000
3. `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 1.0000
4. `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` = 1.0000
5. `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` = 1.0000

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All expansion predicates were correctly implemented:
- `implies/2` (Hash 99C92279): Correctly implements P ⇒ Q as ¬P ∨ Q
- `opposite/1` (Hash B6292BC0): Correct negation via `\+ prove(P)`
- `expand/2` (Hash 22D05CCC): Properly delegates to expansion rules
- `includes/2` (Hash 5AFBB985): Correct set membership via `member/2`
- `extend/3` (Hash 62B0CEA4): Proper list extension implementation
- `refute/1`: Correctly implements unprovability check

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical ProbLog Analysis
- **Logical Correctness:** All predicates maintain sound logical relationships
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` and `ancestor/2` predicates have proper base cases
- **Implication Handling:** `implies(P,Q)` correctly follows classical logic (¬P ∨ Q)
- **Negation:** `opposite(P)` properly implements negation-as-failure

### Probabilistic Analysis
- All test cases returned probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic facts/rules
- The implementation correctly handles:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` via `opposite/1`
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` via `implies/2`
- No probabilistic facts were used in test cases

### DeepProbLog Integration
**Finding:** DeepProbLog features not used (no neural network calls or tensor operations)

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully supported through meta-interpreter and extended predicates
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implements probabilistic logic operations
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used)

### Edge Case Considerations
1. **Undefined expand/2:** Would fail gracefully (no silent errors)
2. **Non-list input:** `includes/2` would fail on non-list inputs (expected behavior)
3. **Deep Recursion:** No protection against stack overflow in deep proofs
4. **Type Safety:** No type checking for arithmetic operations in `expand/2`

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation demonstrates correct handling of both classical and probabilistic logic operations within the tested scope. For production use, additional error handling for edge cases and performance considerations for deep recursion would be recommended enhancements.
