# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code uses logical constraints to determine the arrangement of 5 houses with different attributes (nationality, color, beverage, cigarette, and pet). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against the puzzle's known solution.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows one successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,water,kools,fox), 
       house(ukrainian,blue,tea,chesterfields,horse), 
       house(english,red,milk,winstons,snail), 
       house(spanish,ivory,orange_juice,lucky_strikes,dog), 
       house(japanese,green,coffee,parliaments,zebra)]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle:
1. English in red house
2. Spanish owns dog
3. Green house drinks coffee
4. Ukrainian drinks tea
5. Green right of ivory
6. Winstons smoker has snails
7. Yellow house smokes Kools
8. Middle house drinks milk
9. First house is Norwegian
10. Chesterfields next to fox
11. Kools next to horse
12. Orange juice with Lucky Strikes
13. Japanese smoke Parliaments
14. Norwegian next to blue
15. Contains zebra and water drinker

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and support both classical and probabilistic reasoning contexts.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical ProbLog reasoning:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All constraints are properly translated into Prolog predicates
2. **Recursive Termination**: Helper predicates have proper base cases and recursive cases
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: Though not using probabilistic features, the solution maintains compatibility with ProbLog's rules (all deterministic facts)

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
- Correctly solves the constrained satisfaction problem
- Efficiently handles all puzzle constraints
- Produces the expected unique solution

Edge cases considered:
- House ordering is properly enforced through list positions
- All attribute combinations are properly constrained
- No undefined predicates or infinite recursion risks

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |

The implementation is robust and correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle using ProbLog's classical reasoning capabilities. No modifications are needed for the current requirements.
