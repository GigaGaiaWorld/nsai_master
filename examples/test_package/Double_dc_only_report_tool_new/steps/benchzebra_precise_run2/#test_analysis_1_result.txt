# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The code attempts to solve the puzzle by defining constraints on house attributes (nationality, color, beverage, cigarette, pet) and their spatial relationships.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs because:
1. The code uses `member/2` predicate (line 4) but this predicate is not defined in the provided code
2. While there is a `my_member/2` predicate defined at the end, it's not being used in the main constraints

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Issues**:
   - Missing predicate definition (`member/2`) while being called in multiple constraints
   - The custom `my_member/2` is defined but not integrated into the main puzzle constraints
   - Recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) appear correctly defined

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - Pure logical constraints without probability calculations

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog features not used (no neural network calls or tensor operations)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but fails due to undefined predicate
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the 5-house structure correctly
   - Missing error handling for malformed house structures
   - Recursive predicates have proper base and recursive cases

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure | Replace with `my_member/2` or import lists module |
| 2 | Unused `my_member/2` definition | Dead code | Either use it or remove it |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Limited functionality | Consider adding probabilistic constraints if needed |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Replace all instances of member/2 with my_member/2
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(spanish, _, _, _, dog), Houses),
    % ... (continue with all other constraints)
```

The core logic of the puzzle appears correct, but the implementation fails due to a simple predicate naming issue. Once fixed, it should properly solve the classic Zebra Puzzle.
