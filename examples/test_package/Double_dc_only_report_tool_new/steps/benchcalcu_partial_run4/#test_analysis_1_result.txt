# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to solve a cryptoaddition puzzle where AB + BCD = CDE, with each letter representing a unique digit (0-9) and first digits non-zero. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, tests results, and compliance with ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The program produced 10 valid solutions with probability 1.0000:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All solutions satisfy the constraints:
1. First digits (A,B,C) are non-zero
2. Column addition rules are correctly enforced
3. All digits are unique per solution

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. Key predicates function correctly:
- `leftdigit/1` (Lines 6-7): Properly restricts first digits
- `sumdigit/5` (Lines 14-18): Correctly implements column addition
- `all_different/1` (Lines 10-13): Ensures digit uniqueness

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
1. Logical correctness verified through:
   - Proper base case (`all_different([])`)
   - Correct recursive case (`all_different([H|T])`)
   - Termination guaranteed as list shrinks each recursion

2. Arithmetic constraints:
   - `sumdigit/5` correctly handles carry propagation
   - Digit bounds (0-9) properly enforced

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- No probabilistic facts used (pure logical program)
- All solutions have probability 1.0000 as expected
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct constraint satisfaction
2. Probabilistic reasoning: N/A (deterministic problem)
3. Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge Cases Verified:**
1. First-digit zero prevention works
2. All-digit uniqueness properly enforced
3. Carry propagation handles all cases (X<10 and Xâ‰¥10)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for non-list queries
2. Consider performance for larger puzzles (though not needed here)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Program meets all requirements |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Consider adding input validation |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Document carry propagation logic |
