# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that models coin tossing behavior. The code implements a probabilistic coin model and recursively counts the number of heads (successes) when tossing multiple coins. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both the logical implementation and probabilistic calculations.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 heads when tossing 4 biased coins (P(heads)=0.8):

```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly follow the binomial distribution with parameters n=4 and p=0.8, where:
- P(4 heads) = 0.8⁴ = 0.4096
- P(3 heads) = 4 × 0.8³ × 0.2 = 0.4096
- P(2 heads) = 6 × 0.8² × 0.2² = 0.1536
- P(1 head) = 4 × 0.8 × 0.2³ = 0.0256
- P(0 heads) = 0.2⁴ = 0.0016

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly handles both cases (coin success and failure) and properly accumulates the results.

## Root Cause Analysis
The code demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` properly terminates recursion
2. The recursive cases correctly handle:
   - Successful coin toss (line 5-9): increments count and continues
   - Failed coin toss (line 10-14): continues without increment
3. Probability calculations comply with:
   - P(¬A) = 1−P(A) through the use of `\+ coin(CNT)`
   - Independent event handling through separate recursive calls

The probabilistic facts are properly defined with `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).` and correctly propagate through the recursive counting process.

DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration present).

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
- Classical reasoning: Correct recursive counting logic
- Probabilistic reasoning: Accurate probability calculations
- Edge cases handled:
  - Base case termination
  - Proper probability combination
  - Correct handling of negation

Potential improvements:
1. Could make coin probability configurable
2. Could add input validation for CNT parameter
3. Could optimize tail recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements for probabilistic coin tossing simulation. The test results perfectly match the expected binomial distribution for 4 trials with success probability 0.8.
