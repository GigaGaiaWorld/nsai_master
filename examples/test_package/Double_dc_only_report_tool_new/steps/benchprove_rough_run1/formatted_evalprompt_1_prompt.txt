</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes basic predicates like `member/2` and several extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) as required. The purpose is to verify correctness in both classical and probabilistic contexts, analyze test failures, and assess compliance with requirements.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries failed with the error: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 16:35`. The primary issue stems from the incorrect implementation of the `implies/2` predicate using Prolog's `->` operator, which isn't directly supported in ProbLog's meta-interpreter context.

## Failure Localization
1. **Main Error**: 
   - Location: Line containing `prove(implies(A, B)) :- (prove(A) -> prove(B); true).`
   - Problem: ProbLog doesn't support Prolog's `->` operator in this context
   - Impact: All queries fail because the meta-interpreter cannot process the implication

2. **Missing Predicates**:
   - `opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1` are required but not implemented
   - Impact: Queries using these predicates cannot be evaluated

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Issues**:
   - The meta-interpreter cannot handle Prolog's control structures (`->/2`)
   - Missing implementations for required predicates violate the specification
   - Recursive termination is correct for implemented predicates like `member/2`

2. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are present in the code
   - Probability rules like P(¬A)=1−P(A) aren't applicable in current implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (basic predicates work, but extended ones fail)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined `expand/2` cases would fail gracefully
   - Non-list inputs to list predicates would cause type errors
   - Deep recursion could cause stack overflow with very large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Using Prolog's `->` operator in ProbLog | All queries fail | Implement `implies/2` using pure ProbLog syntax |
| 2 | Missing required predicates (`opposite/1`, etc.) | Incomplete functionality | Implement all required predicates |
| 3 | No probabilistic facts/rules | Limited to classical logic | Add probabilistic elements if needed |
| 4 | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Add `nn/3` calls if required |

**Recommendations**:
1. Rewrite `implies/2` without `->` operator:
```problog
prove(implies(A,B)) :- \+ prove(A).
prove(implies(A,B)) :- prove(A), prove(B).
```

2. Implement missing predicates:
```problog
prove(opposite(A)) :- \+ prove(A).
prove(includes(List,Elem)) :- member(Elem,List).
prove(extend(List,Elem,[Elem|List])).
prove(refute(A)) :- \+ prove(A).
```

3. Add probabilistic facts/rules if probabilistic reasoning is required.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
