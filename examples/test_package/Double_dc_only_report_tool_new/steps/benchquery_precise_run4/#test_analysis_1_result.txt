# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided population and area data, then finds country pairs where densities differ by less than 5%.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful queries:
```
query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results correctly identify country pairs with density ratios between 0.95 and 1.05 (within 5% of each other).

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly:
- Calculates densities using integer arithmetic (`D is (P * 100) // A`)
- Applies the 5% approximation formula (`20*D1 < 21*D2` and `20*D2 < 21*D1`)
- Ensures unique pairs with `C1 @< C2`

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
### Logical Correctness:
- The density calculation correctly implements floor division after scaling
- The inequality constraints properly approximate the 5% threshold without floating-point operations
- The `C1 @< C2` constraint prevents duplicate pairs

### Probabilistic Aspects:
- All queries return probability 1.0000 as expected for deterministic facts
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this program
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
✅ **Classical reasoning**: Fully implemented with correct density calculation and comparison  
✅ **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not required for this deterministic query  
✅ **Neural network integration**: Not applicable  

### Edge Cases Considered:
- Integer division handles all population/area combinations correctly
- Country pair ordering prevents duplicates
- The 5% approximation works for all density ranges

### Potential Improvements:
1. Could add validation for negative populations/areas
2. Might benefit from memoization for large datasets
3. Could include probabilistic population estimates
