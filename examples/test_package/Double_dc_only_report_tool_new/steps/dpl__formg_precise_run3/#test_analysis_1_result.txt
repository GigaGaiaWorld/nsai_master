# Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The code recursively splits a list, sorts the sublists, and merges them back together. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, recursive termination, and edge case handling in classical ProbLog scenarios.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
**Result:**
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorted the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation meets all specified requirements:
1. Correctly handles list length determination (Code Block B56DC140)
2. Properly implements recursive boundary conditions
3. Accurately splits lists and merges sorted sublists (Code Block C59ECA2A)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical ProbLog:
1. **Recursive Termination**: The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) properly terminate recursion
2. **List Splitting**: The `split_list` predicate correctly divides lists into equal halves
3. **Merging Logic**: The `merge` predicate properly handles all comparison cases
4. **Probabilistic Correctness**: Since no probabilistic facts are used, the deterministic output of 1.0000 is appropriate

DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
- Correctly implements the merge sort algorithm
- Handles base cases and recursive cases properly
- Produces deterministic sorted output

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list input**: Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)
2. **Empty list**: Handled by the first clause
3. **Single-element list**: Handled by the second clause
4. **Performance**: Recursive depth is logarithmic to list length

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | N/A |

**Word Count**: 398

The implementation is correct for the tested cases and demonstrates proper recursive sorting logic. For production use, additional type checking and performance optimization might be considered for very large lists.
