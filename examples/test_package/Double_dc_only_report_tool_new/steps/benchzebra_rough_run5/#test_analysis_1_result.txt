# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code uses logical constraints to deduce the correct arrangement of houses with specific attributes. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and analyze its compliance with ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned exactly one solution with probability 1.0000:
```
[house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
 house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
 house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
 house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
 house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution satisfies all 15 constraints of the original puzzle:
1. Englishman in red house
2. Spaniard owns dog
3. Coffee in green house
4. Ukrainian drinks tea
5. Green house immediately to right of ivory
6. Winston smoker owns snails
7. Kools smoked in yellow house
8. Milk in middle house
9. Norwegian in first house
10. Chesterfield smoker next to fox
11. Kools smoker next to horse
12. Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice
13. Japanese smokes Parliaments
14. Norwegian next to blue house
15. Zebra and water drinker correctly positioned

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and support the main puzzle constraints.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All constraints are properly translated into Prolog rules
2. **Recursive Termination**: Helper predicates have proper base cases and recursive steps
3. **Deterministic Solution**: The puzzle has exactly one solution found with probability 1.0

Probabilistic aspects verification:
- No probabilistic facts are used (pure logical solution)
- No negations or implications requiring probability calculations
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct constraint satisfaction
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (pure logical puzzle)
- Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. House list structure is fixed to exactly 5 elements
2. All helper predicates handle empty lists properly
3. Positional constraints (`right_of`, `next_to`) work correctly at list boundaries

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for house list structure
2. Consider probabilistic version with uncertain attributes
3. Add explanatory comments for each constraint

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle using classical ProbLog constraints without any failures or probabilistic elements. All helper predicates are properly defined and support the main puzzle logic effectively.
