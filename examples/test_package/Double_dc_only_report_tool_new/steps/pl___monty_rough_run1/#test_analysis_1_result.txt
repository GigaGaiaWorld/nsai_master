# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a player selects a door (always door 1), and the host (Monty) opens another door revealing no prize. The implementation tests both "keep" and "switch" strategies to determine their winning probabilities.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform prize distribution (1/3 for each door)
2. Consistent initial selection (door 1)
3. Correct probability for keeping (1/3) and switching (2/3) strategies

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. The implementation meets all requirements:
1. When two non-prize, non-selected doors exist, Monty chooses uniformly (line 6-7)
2. When only one non-prize, non-selected door exists, Monty must open it (implicit in line 6)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic logic correctly implements the Monty Hall scenario:
1. Prize distribution uses proper probabilistic facts (line 1)
2. The `open_door` predicate handles both cases:
   - Two available doors: Uses 0.5::true to model uniform choice
   - One available door: Deterministic opening via member/2
3. Probability calculations follow:
   - P(Â¬prize(X)) = 1 - P(prize(X))
   - Conditional probabilities correctly model the host's behavior

Classical Prolog aspects:
- `member/2` recursion terminates properly on finite lists
- No infinite recursion paths exist
- All cases are covered by the two `open_door` scenarios

## Overall Analysis
**Functional requirements met:**
- Classical reasoning: Correct handling of door selection and prize location
- Probabilistic reasoning: Accurate probability calculations for both strategies
- DeepProbLog: Feature not used (no neural network integration)

**Edge cases handled:**
- Fixed initial selection (door 1) simplifies scenario
- All possible prize locations covered
- Host behavior correctly models both possible door-opening scenarios

**Potential improvements:**
1. Make initial door selection variable
2. Add validation for door numbers
3. Consider adding visualization of possible scenarios

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | Implementation correct | 

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probability calculations for both strategies, demonstrating proper understanding of both the problem domain and ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning capabilities.
