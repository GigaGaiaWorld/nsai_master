# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program uses population and area data for various countries to calculate and compare densities.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure:
```
Error: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7
```
The program fails because the required `query_pop/1` predicate is not implemented, despite being specified in the requirements.

## Failure Localization
- **Failed Query**: `query_pop/1` (line 59)
- **Missing Implementation**: The entire `query_pop/1` predicate is undefined
- **Impact**: The main query functionality cannot be executed

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The `density/2` predicate (lines 1-4) is correctly implemented to calculate population density
   - Population and area data are properly defined (lines 7-34 and 36-58 respectively)
   - However, the core query functionality is missing

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this program
   - DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

3. **Termination**:
   - The existing `density/2` predicate will terminate as it uses simple arithmetic operations
   - No recursive predicates are present

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (data and calculation exist, but query logic missing)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The `Area > 0` check in `density/2` properly handles division by zero
   - No handling for missing country data
   - No input validation for the 5% density difference requirement

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `query_pop/1` implementation | Core functionality unavailable | Implement query to find countries with similar densities |
| 2 | No density comparison logic | Cannot find matching countries | Add predicate to compare densities within 5% threshold |
| 3 | No result formatting | Output would be hard to read | Include formatting in query results |

## Recommended Solution
```prolog
% Helper predicate to check if densities are within 5% of each other
similar_density(D1, D2) :-
    Ratio is D1 / D2,
    Ratio >= 0.95, Ratio =< 1.05.

% Main query predicate
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    similar_density(Density1, Density2).
```

The missing functionality can be added with these predicates, which will:
1. Calculate densities for all countries
2. Find pairs of different countries
3. Verify their densities are within 5% of each other
4. Return the matching pairs with their density values
