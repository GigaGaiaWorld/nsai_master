# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program calculates population density from provided facts about population and area, then finds country pairs meeting the similarity criteria.

## Test Results Summary
All test cases passed successfully. The program returned 8 correct country pairs with matching densities within the specified 5% threshold. Each query returned with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic success in these cases.

**Passed Queries:**
1. `query_pop([china, 2.440828402366864, france, 2.464788732394366]) = 1.0000`
2. `query_pop([indonesia, 2.23859649122807, pakistan, 2.192926045016077]) = 1.0000`
3. `query_pop([pakistan, 2.192926045016077, indonesia, 2.23859649122807]) = 1.0000`
4. `query_pop([mexico, 0.760471204188482, ethiopia, 0.777142857142857]) = 1.0000`
5. `query_pop([italy, 4.775862068965517, philippines, 4.611111111111111]) = 1.0000`
6. `query_pop([france, 2.464788732394366, china, 2.440828402366864]) = 1.0000`
7. `query_pop([philippines, 4.611111111111111, italy, 4.775862068965517]) = 1.0000`
8. `query_pop([ethiopia, 0.777142857142857, mexico, 0.760471204188482]) = 1.0000`

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned expected country pairs with density ratios between 0.95 and 1.05, and all probabilities were correctly reported as 1.0000.

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct logical implementation:

1. **Density Calculation**:
```prolog
density(Country, Density) :- 
    pop(Country, Pop), 
    area(Country, Area), 
    Area > 0, 
    Density is Pop / Area.
```
- Correctly handles division by zero with `Area > 0` check
- Properly calculates density using integer arithmetic

2. **Similarity Check**:
```prolog
similar_density(D1, D2) :- 
    Ratio is D1 / D2, 
    Ratio >= 0.95, 
    Ratio =< 1.05.
```
- Correctly implements the 5% threshold in both directions
- Handles ratio calculation safely

3. **Query Predicate**:
```prolog
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :- 
    density(Country1, Density1), 
    density(Country2, Density2), 
    Country1 \= Country2, 
    similar_density(Density1, Density2).
```
- Ensures countries are distinct with `Country1 \= Country2`
- Properly chains the density calculations and similarity check

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not heavily used (simple deterministic queries)
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Division by zero prevented by `Area > 0` check
2. Country comparison ensures no self-matches
3. Ratio calculation works for either density order (D1/D2 or D2/D1)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Could add probabilistic facts for uncertain population/area data
2. Might benefit from indexing for larger country databases
3. Could add symmetry breaking to avoid duplicate pairs (A,B) and (B,A)
