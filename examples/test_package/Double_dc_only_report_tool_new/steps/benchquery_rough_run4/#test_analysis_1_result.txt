# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program uses population and area data to calculate densities and compare them across countries.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure:
```
Error: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7
```
The program fails to execute because the required `query_pop/1` predicate is not implemented, despite being specified in the requirements.

## Failure Localization
- **Failed Query**: `query_pop/1` (line 59)
- **Missing Implementation**: The entire `query_pop/1` predicate is undefined
- **Related Code**: 
  - Density calculation (lines 3-4) is correctly implemented
  - Population and area facts (lines 7-35, 37-59) are properly defined

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Analysis**:
   - The existing `density/2` predicate is logically correct for calculating density
   - Missing comparison logic for finding countries with similar densities
   - No recursive calls present, so termination isn't an issue

2. **Probabilistic Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - Basic deterministic Prolog-style programming only
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- ❌ Not met: Missing implementation of `query_pop/1` to find countries with similar densities
- ✅ Partially met: Correct density calculation exists
- ✅ Data facts properly defined

**Edge Cases**:
- No handling for countries with zero area (would cause division error)
- No duplicate checking in results (a country could pair with itself)
- No input validation for the query

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `query_pop/1` implementation | Complete failure | Implement the query as specified |
| 2 | No density comparison logic | Cannot find matching pairs | Add comparison with 5% threshold |
| 3 | No protection against division by zero | Potential runtime error | Add area > 0 check |

## Corrective Implementation
```prolog
% Implement the required query
query_pop([Country1,Density1,Country2,Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    abs(Density1 - Density2) / min(Density1, Density2) =< 0.05.
```

This implementation would:
1. Calculate densities for all countries
2. Find pairs of different countries
3. Ensure densities are within 5% of each other
4. Return the country names and their densities
