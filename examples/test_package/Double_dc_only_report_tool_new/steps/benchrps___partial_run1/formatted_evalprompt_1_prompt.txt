</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on move definitions, win/lose rules, game result calculation, and score computation. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verdict:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly identifies player2 as the winner with perfect certainty, which matches expected behavior since player2 wins 2 rounds (paper beats rock twice) and loses 1 round (rock beats scissor).

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
- Move definitions (lines 1-9)
- Beat relationships (lines 10-18)
- Result calculation (lines 20-30)
- Game playing recursion (lines 32-38)
- Score computation (lines 39-47)
- Winner determination (lines 48-53)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- Logical correctness verified: All rules properly implement game semantics
- Recursive termination guaranteed: Base cases exist for both `play/3` and `compute_score/2`
- Edge cases handled: Empty lists, draw conditions, and all move combinations work correctly

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules present in this implementation
- All results are deterministic (probability 1.0000)
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning fully implemented for game rules and scoring
- Probabilistic reasoning not required/implemented in this solution
- Neural network integration not required (DeepProbLog not used)

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list inputs:** Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)
2. **Uneven move lists:** Not handled (assumes equal length lists)
3. **Invalid moves:** Not validated (e.g., `move(fire)` would break rules)
4. **Deep recursion:** Safe for reasonable game lengths

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add move validation |
| 2 | Uneven lists not handled | Incorrect results | Add length check |
| 3 | No probabilistic rules | Limited to deterministic play | Add probability for moves |
| 4 | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Consider NN move prediction |

**Word count:** 398 words

The implementation correctly handles the specified requirements for deterministic rock-paper-scissors gameplay. The main areas for improvement would be input validation and handling of uneven move lists, which would make the program more robust in practical use cases.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
