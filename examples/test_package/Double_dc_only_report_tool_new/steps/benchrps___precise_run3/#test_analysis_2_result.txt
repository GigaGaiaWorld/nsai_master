# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The code should correctly calculate round results and determine the overall winner by scoring.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`
2. **Error Location**: Line 41, character 77
3. **Problem Area**: The `determine_winner` predicate is incorrectly formatted with a line break before completion
4. **Affected Code**:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; Winner = draw).</Code_Block>
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate definition is split across multiple lines with improper formatting and contains XML-like tags
2. **Logical Structure**: The core logic (after fixing syntax) appears correct:
   - `play/3` correctly generates results for each round
   - `compute_score/2` properly calculates the total score
   - The conditional correctly determines the winner
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
4. **DeepProbLog**: DeepProbLog features are not used in this code

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning requirements are partially met (core logic is correct but syntax prevents execution)
   - Probabilistic reasoning is not utilized
   - Neural network integration is not present
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Unequal length move lists would cause failure
   - Invalid moves would not be validated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed predicate definition with line break and XML tags | Code cannot execute | Remove line break and XML tags, use proper Prolog syntax |
| 2 | No input validation | Could fail with invalid moves | Add move validation predicate |
| 3 | No handling for unequal length lists | Potential failure | Add length check or pad shorter list |

**Recommendation**: Fix the syntax error by using the correct predicate definition:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The core game logic appears sound once the syntax issues are resolved. The implementation would benefit from additional input validation and edge case handling.
