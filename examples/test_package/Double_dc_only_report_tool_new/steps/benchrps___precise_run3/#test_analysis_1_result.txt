# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that calculates game results between two players. The code includes move definitions, win/lose rules, result calculation, score computation, and winner determination.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate (line 41) due to:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (missing period at end)
2. Malformed if-then-else construct in the original code
3. The corrected version should use proper Prolog syntax for conditional branching

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog:
1. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/3` is correctly implemented
2. The logical relationships between moves are properly defined
3. The error stems from syntactic issues rather than logical flaws

Probabilistic aspects:
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- The code operates purely in classical logic mode
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
- Neural network integration: Not used

Edge cases:
- Non-list inputs not handled
- Uneven move lists not checked
- Empty lists are properly handled
- Deep recursion not an issue due to limited game rounds

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Compilation fails | Add missing period after predicate |
| 2 | Malformed if-then-else | Syntax error | Use proper Prolog conditional syntax |
| 3 | Untested edge cases | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |

## Corrected Code
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The corrected version properly terminates the predicate with a period and uses standard Prolog conditional syntax. With this fix, the test query should execute successfully, returning `Winner = player2` since player2 wins 2 out of 3 rounds.
