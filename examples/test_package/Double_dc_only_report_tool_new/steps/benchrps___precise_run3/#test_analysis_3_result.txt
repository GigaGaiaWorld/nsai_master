# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code should determine the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and proper handling of game rules.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
No tests passed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate at line 41. The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (missing closing period)
2. Malformed if-then-else construct in the final implementation

The problematic section:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; Winner = draw).</Code_Block>
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate definition is incomplete and contains malformed markup
2. **Logical Structure**: The core logic (once corrected) properly implements:
   - Game rule checking via `beats/2`
   - Result calculation via `result/3`
   - Recursive list processing via `play/3`
   - Score computation via `compute_score/2`
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used (classical Prolog only)
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration detected ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core logic exists but has syntax errors)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Uneven move lists not addressed
   - Empty lists correctly handled via base case
   - Deep recursion not a concern for typical game lengths

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Code won't compile | Add missing period and remove markup |
| 2 | Malformed if-then-else | Logical error | Use proper Prolog syntax for conditionals |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for move lists |

## Corrected Implementation
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1;
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2;
     Winner = draw).
```

The corrected version should properly:
1. Calculate round results
2. Compute final score
3. Determine the winner based on score comparison
