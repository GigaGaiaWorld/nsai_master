<Requirements>please construct the alphabet math puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE with following laws:
 1. Firstly define all the digits, the first digit of a multi-digit number cannot be 0 (with the help of digit/1 and leftdigit/1),
 2. Different letters refer to different numbers with the help of all_different/1,
 3. calculate with the help of sumdigit/5, don't forget to carry. </Requirements></Langda>
.
% Initiate query example:
query(query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])).

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
