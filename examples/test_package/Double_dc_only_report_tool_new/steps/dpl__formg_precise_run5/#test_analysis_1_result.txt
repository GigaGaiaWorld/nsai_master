# Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The code recursively splits a list, sorts the sublists, and merges them back together. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, recursive termination, and edge case handling in classical ProbLog scenarios.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. List concatenation via append/3

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical ProbLog:

1. **Recursive Termination:**
   - Base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) properly terminate recursion
   - List splitting ensures progress toward base cases (line 3-5)

2. **Merging Logic:**
   - Merge rules correctly handle element comparison (line 13-18)
   - Empty list cases properly terminate merging (line 11-12)

3. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used (pure deterministic sorting)
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets classical reasoning requirements:

**Strengths:**
- Correct implementation of merge sort algorithm
- Proper handling of base cases
- Accurate recursive decomposition

**Edge Cases Considered:**
- Empty list (`[]`)
- Single-element list (`[X]`)
- Even and odd-length lists

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add type checking for non-list inputs
2. Consider performance for very large lists (deep recursion)
3. Add probabilistic version with uncertain comparisons

The implementation is correct for the tested cases and demonstrates proper recursive logic. For production use, additional edge case testing and potential performance optimizations could be considered.
