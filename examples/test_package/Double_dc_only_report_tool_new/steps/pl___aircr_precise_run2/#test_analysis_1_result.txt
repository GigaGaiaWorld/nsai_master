# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic for this safety-critical system.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time as expected, and overrun exceptions only occur after the first step when positions might exceed legal bounds.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Goal checking (line 12-14)
2. Actuator selection and strength application (line 25-27)
3. Wind effect calculation (line 8-10)
4. Position legality verification (line 4-6)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented:
1. Actuator selection follows the 50/50 distribution (line 7)
2. Wind strength probabilities properly cascade to wind effects (line 8-10)
3. Position calculations correctly combine deterministic and probabilistic components (line 25-32)
4. The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` (line 6) properly handles illegal positions

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
- Classical reasoning (goal checking, position updates)
- Probabilistic reasoning (actuator selection, wind effects)

Edge cases handled correctly:
1. Illegal position detection (overrun exceptions)
2. Goal state termination condition
3. Time-bound execution (limited to 5 steps)

The decreasing probability of `goal_reached` over time suggests the system might benefit from a more aggressive control strategy or actuator strength adjustment.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | Consider optimizing actuator selection strategy |
| 2 | None | N/A | Monitor decreasing goal probability trend |

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning with proper handling of both deterministic and stochastic components in this control system scenario.
