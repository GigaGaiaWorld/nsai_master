</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse mathematical expressions from image detection results. The program should handle sequences of numbers and operators, evaluating them correctly while accounting for floating-point precision via `almost_equal/2`.

## Test Results Summary
The test query was:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

Result:
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],X2) = 0.0000
```

**Test Status**: Failed. The query returned probability 0.0000 when it should have computed the expression (2/3 + 3 - 2*7).

## Failure Localization
The failure occurs because:
1. The `parse/2` predicate only handles single-number cases (line 22-23)
2. Missing rules for parsing operator sequences (required by the task)
3. No implementation for operator precedence or chained operations

Error location: Entire `parse/2` implementation is incomplete (lines 22-23)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The current implementation cannot parse compound expressions, only single numbers
2. **Recursion**: Missing recursive cases for operator handling
3. **Precision Handling**: `almost_equal/2` is correctly defined but unused in expression evaluation
4. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts/rules are used in this implementation
5. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met**:
- Basic number detection works
- `almost_equal/2` correctly implemented

**Requirements Missing**:
- Expression parsing (main requirement)
- Operator precedence handling
- Chained operation support

**Edge Cases Not Handled**:
- Empty lists
- Invalid operator sequences
- Division by zero
- Non-list inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing expression parsing rules | Complete failure of main functionality | Implement parse/2 for operator sequences |
| 2 | No operator precedence handling | Incorrect evaluation order | Add parentheses handling or precedence rules |
| 3 | No chained operation support | Can't evaluate multi-operator expressions | Add recursive parse cases for operator handling |
| 4 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type/sequence checking |

**Recommended Fixes**:
1. Implement full `parse/2` with separate clauses for each operator
2. Add proper recursive handling for chained operations
3. Consider operator precedence rules
4. Add input validation

```prolog
% Suggested parse/2 implementation
parse([N,Op,M|T], R) :-
    almost_equal(N, N2),
    almost_equal(M, M2),
    compute(Op, N2, M2, Temp),
    parse([Temp|T], R).
parse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R).

compute(+, A, B, R) :- R is A + B.
compute(-, A, B, R) :- R is A - B.
compute(*, A, B, R) :- R is A * B.
compute(/, A, B, R) :- R is A / B.
```

The current implementation scores 2/10 for meeting requirements, with the main functionality (expression parsing) completely missing. The fix would require about 20-30 lines of additional code to properly handle all required cases.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
