</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates match results between two players, and determines an overall winner. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, test verification, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The system executed one test case:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** 
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 as the winner (2 losses vs 1 win for player1), matching expected game logic.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Basic move definitions (rock, paper, scissor)
- Win/lose relationships (beats/2)
- Result calculation (result/3)
- Score computation (compute_score/2)
- Winner determination (determine_winner/3)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Problog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - All game rules properly encode rock-paper-scissors semantics
   - Recursive predicates (`play/3`, `compute_score/2`) correctly terminate with base cases
   - Mutual exclusivity of results (win/lose/draw) is maintained

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - No probabilistic facts are used in this implementation
   - The 1.0000 probability reflects deterministic computation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

**Edge Case Verification:**
- Empty lists return empty results (base case handling)
- Draw conditions properly handled via `result(X,X,draw)`
- Score computation correctly accumulates (+1/-1/0 for win/lose/draw)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct game logic
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (deterministic implementation)
- Neural network integration: Not present (DeepProbLog not used)

**Edge Cases:**
1. **Non-list Input:** Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)
2. **Uneven Move Lists:** Would fail due to unmatched recursion (no explicit handling)
3. **Invalid Moves:** Undefined moves would fail silently in `result/3`

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking predicates |
| 2 | Uneven move lists unhandled | Partial results possible | Add length verification |
| 3 | No probabilistic extension | Limited to deterministic play | Add probability to moves |

**Code Quality Note:** The implementation is logically sound for its specified purpose but could benefit from extended error handling and probabilistic enhancements for more realistic gameplay simulation. The recursive structure is efficient for typical game lengths but could face stack issues with very long move sequences (>10,000 elements).

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
