# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on move definitions, win/lose relationships, game result calculation, and score computation. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** 
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```
**Verdict:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly identifies player2 as the winner (2 losses vs 1 win for player1).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. All predicates are correctly defined:
- Move definitions (lines 3-8)
- Win/lose relationships (lines 10-15)
- Game result calculation (lines 18-28)
- Score computation (lines 30-38)
- Winner determination (lines 40-45)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All rules properly implement rock-paper-scissors logic
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: No probabilistic facts are used (pure logical program)
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully met (correct game logic implementation)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. Non-list inputs would fail (no type checking)
2. Uneven move lists would cause incomplete results
3. Undefined moves would cause failures
4. Deep recursion could impact performance with long move lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking predicates |
| 2 | Uneven lists not handled | Incomplete results | Add length verification |
| 3 | No probabilistic facts | Limited to deterministic play | Consider adding probabilistic moves |
| 4 | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Consider adding nn-based move prediction |

The implementation correctly handles the specified rock-paper-scissors logic but could benefit from extended error handling and probabilistic features for more realistic gameplay scenarios.
