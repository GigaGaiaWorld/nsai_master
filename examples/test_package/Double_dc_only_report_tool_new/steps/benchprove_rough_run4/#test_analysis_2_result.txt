# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing an extended meta-interpreter with additional logical processing capabilities. The purpose is to verify correctness of the implementation against specified requirements and analyze any failures in classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show one critical failure:
```
Error: No clauses found for 'double/2' at 34:20
```

Failed queries:
1. `prove(expand(double(3),6))` - Failed due to undefined `double/2` predicate
2. All other queries were not executed due to this fatal error

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `expand/2` predicate (lines 34-35) when trying to evaluate `double(3)`. The system cannot find any clauses defining the `double/2` operation despite its usage in the test query.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The meta-interpreter core (lines 1-12) is correctly implemented
   - Extended predicates (`implies`, `opposite`, etc.) follow proper logical definitions
   - Missing `double/2` definition violates the requirement for `expand/2` functionality

2. **Probabilistic Compliance**:
   - No probabilistic facts/rules were tested
   - The implementation of `implies/2` correctly follows `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`
   - `opposite/1` and `refute/1` correctly implement negation as failure

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog features not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core works but expansion fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not tested
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined `expand/2` operations cause fatal errors
   - Non-list inputs to list operations would fail
   - Recursive performance not tested

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `double/2` definition | Fatal error preventing execution | Add required arithmetic operations |
| 2 | Incomplete test execution | Unable to verify other features | Fix primary error first |
| 3 | No probabilistic tests | Limited validation | Add probabilistic test cases |

```prolog
% Recommended fix:
expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.  % Add this definition
expand(square(X), Y) :- Y is X*X.  % Already present
```

The implementation shows promise but requires completion of all necessary supporting predicates. The meta-interpreter framework is correctly structured but needs comprehensive testing after fixing the immediate error. Future work should include probabilistic test cases and edge case handling.
