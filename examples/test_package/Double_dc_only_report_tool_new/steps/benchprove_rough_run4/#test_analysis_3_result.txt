# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes basic meta-interpretation, implication handling, and several expansion predicates. The purpose is to verify correctness in both classical and probabilistic contexts, and to analyze test results against expected behavior.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show mixed success:
- **Passed**: `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` (1.0000)
- **Failed**: All other queries returned 0.0000 when they should have succeeded

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))`
   - **Issue**: Missing `opposite/1` predicate definition
   - **Location**: Entirely undefined in code

2. **Failed Query**: `prove(expand(double(3),6))`
   - **Issue**: `expand/2` predicate exists but isn't properly integrated with `prove/1`
   - **Location**: No `prove(expand(...))` clause defined

3. **Failed Query**: `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))`
   - **Issue**: Missing `includes/2` predicate definition
   - **Location**: Entirely undefined in code

4. **Failed Query**: `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))`
   - **Issue**: Missing `extend/3` predicate definition
   - **Location**: Entirely undefined in code

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog**:
   - The implication handling is correctly implemented with two clauses covering both cases (¬A and A∧B)
   - Missing predicates cause failures in other test cases
   - Recursive termination is correct for existing predicates

2. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - The implication correctly follows P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)
   - Missing predicates result in zero probabilities for failed tests
   - No probabilistic facts are used in this program

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (only implication works)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Basic support present
   - Neural network integration: Not implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined predicates cause complete failure
   - No handling of non-list inputs for list operations
   - No performance concerns with current recursion depth

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing opposite/1 | Fails opposite queries | Implement negation handling |
| 2 | Missing includes/2 | Fails membership tests | Use member/2 or implement includes/2 |
| 3 | Missing extend/3 | Fails list extension | Implement list prepend operation |
| 4 | Unintegrated expand/2 | Fails expansion proofs | Add prove(expand(X,Y)) clause |

```prolog
% Suggested fixes for missing predicates
prove(opposite(A)) :- \+ prove(A).
prove(includes(List,Elem)) :- member(Elem,List).
prove(extend(List,Elem,NewList)) :- NewList = [Elem|List].
prove(expand(X,Y)) :- expand(X,Y).
```

The implementation shows promise but requires completion of all specified predicates. The implication handling demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning, while other features need implementation to match requirements.
