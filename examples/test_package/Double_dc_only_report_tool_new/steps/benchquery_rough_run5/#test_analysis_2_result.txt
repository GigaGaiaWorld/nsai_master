# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program calculates population density from provided facts about population and area, then finds country pairs meeting the density similarity criterion.

## Test Results Summary
All test cases passed successfully. The program returned 8 correct country pairs with matching probabilities of 1.0000, indicating deterministic success for these queries. The results show symmetrical pairs (e.g., [A,B] and [B,A]) and correctly calculated density ratios within the 5% threshold.

Passing queries:
```
query_pop([china, 2.440828402366864, france, 2.464788732394366]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 2.23859649122807, pakistan, 2.192926045016077]) = 1.0000
query_pop([pakistan, 2.192926045016077, indonesia, 2.23859649122807]) = 1.0000
query_pop([mexico, 0.760471204188482, ethiopia, 0.777142857142857]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 4.775862068965517, philippines, 4.611111111111111]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 2.464788732394366, china, 2.440828402366864]) = 1.0000
query_pop([philippines, 4.611111111111111, italy, 4.775862068965517]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 0.777142857142857, mexico, 0.760471204188482]) = 1.0000
```

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the test results. All queries returned expected country pairs with correct density calculations and proper probability values. The key predicates performed as designed:

1. `density/2` (Lines 1-4): Correctly calculates density from population and area facts
2. `query_pop/1` (Lines 5-6): Properly filters country pairs with <5% density difference

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical ProbLog:

1. **Density Calculation**: The `density/2` predicate correctly implements `Pop/Area` with area > 0 check
2. **Similarity Check**: The 5% threshold comparison uses proper relative difference formula: `abs(D1-D2)/min(D1,D2) =< 0.05`
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: All results show probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic facts and rules
4. **Termination**: The program terminates properly as it uses finite facts without recursion

Edge cases handled:
- Area > 0 check prevents division by zero
- Country1 \= Country2 prevents self-comparisons
- Symmetrical pairs are allowed (A,B and B,A both valid)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly queries and filters country pairs
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Properly handles deterministic facts (though no probabilistic facts are used)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used (not required for this task)

Potential improvements:
1. Could add probabilistic uncertainty to population/area figures
2. Might benefit from indexing for larger datasets
3. Could normalize country names for case sensitivity

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The code demonstrates correct implementation of the specified requirements with proper handling of edge cases. All test cases pass validation, showing accurate density calculations and proper country pair selection.
