# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to perform simple digit recognition and addition operations. The code consists of digit facts (img_1 to img_0) and an addition rule that sums the recognized digits. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and its test results.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
```
Test result:
```
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The test correctly returns that 5 + 6 equals 11 with full probability (1.0000), which matches the expected behavior.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates function as intended:
- Digit facts (img_1 to img_0) are correctly defined
- The addition rule properly sums the digit values
- The query returns the expected result

## Root Cause Analysis
In this classical ProbLog scenario:
1. **Logical correctness**: The program is logically sound. The addition predicate correctly retrieves digit values and computes their sum.
2. **Recursive termination**: Not applicable as the program contains no recursive rules.
3. **Probabilistic rules**: The program uses only certain facts (probability 1.0), so probabilistic computations like P(¬A) or P(A⇒B) are not involved.
4. **DeepProbLog features**: DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) are not used in this program.

## Overall Analysis
The program meets its functional requirements for classical reasoning:
- Correctly defines digit-image relationships
- Properly implements addition logic
- Returns accurate query results

**Edge cases considered**:
1. All digits (0-9) are properly defined
2. The addition rule handles all possible digit combinations
3. No list inputs or recursive operations are present that could cause issues

Potential improvements:
1. Could add input validation for the addition predicate
2. Could include probabilistic digits for more complex scenarios
3. Could extend with neural network integration for actual image recognition

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | N/A |

The program is functionally correct for its specified requirements, with no errors detected in the current implementation and test cases. The simple nature of the program limits potential edge cases, but the current implementation handles its defined scope effectively.
