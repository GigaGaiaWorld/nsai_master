# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under varying wind conditions and actuator choices, with probabilistic outcomes for both successful goal achievement and overrun exceptions. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in this safety-critical system.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probabilities for queries at time steps 1 through 5:

**Goal Achievement Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1): 0.2625
- goal_reached(2): 0.1873
- goal_reached(3): 0.1269
- goal_reached(4): 0.0841
- goal_reached(5): 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1): 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2): 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3): 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4): 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5): 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results show logically consistent probabilities that decrease over time for goal achievement while maintaining low but non-zero probabilities for overrun exceptions.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Time-step progression (lines 15-17)
- Actuator selection (lines 5-6)
- Wind effect modeling (lines 8-10)
- Legal position checking (lines 3, 12-14)
- Goal verification (lines 18-19)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection follows the defined 50/50 distribution
2. Wind strength probabilities correctly propagate through the model
3. Position calculations properly combine deterministic actuator strength and probabilistic wind effects
4. The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` correctly implements P(Â¬A) = 1-P(A)
5. No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are used in this implementation

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for position tracking and goal checking
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly models actuator choice and wind effects
- Neural network integration: Not used (as expected for this model)

**Edge Cases Verified:**
- Initial position (time=0) is properly handled
- Position bounds (0-10) are enforced
- Wind effects can push positions beyond legal bounds
- Goal checking prevents further movement attempts

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add validation for actuator strength values
2. Consider modeling actuator failure probabilities
3. Add maximum time limit to prevent infinite recursion

## 6. Error Summary

**Code Block Verification (Hash: A5C06F43):**
```prolog
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    flap_position(Prev,CurrentPos), 
    goal(TargetPos), 
    use_actuator(Time,Actuator), 
    actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength), 
    wind_effect(Time,WindEffect), 
    Direction is sign(TargetPos - CurrentPos), 
    Pos is CurrentPos + (Direction * Strength) + WindEffect.
```
This core calculation correctly implements the required position update logic combining deterministic and probabilistic components.
