# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog bubblesort implementation adapted for ProbLog. The code aims to provide an interpretable sorting algorithm through recursive bubble operations. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, termination, and ProbLog compatibility.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:14
```
The query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` could not be executed due to syntax incompatibility with ProbLog.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-9), specifically at line 4 where the Prolog conditional operator `->` is used. ProbLog does not natively support this Prolog control structure.

Problematic code segment:
```prolog
(L == L1 ->
    append(Acc, L, Sorted)
;
    append(Acc, [Min|Rest], NewAcc),
    bubblesort(Rest, NewAcc, Sorted)
)
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Incompatibility**: ProbLog uses a restricted subset of Prolog and doesn't support the `->/2` conditional operator
2. **Logical Structure**: The algorithm's core logic (bubble/2 predicate) is correctly implemented for standard Prolog
3. **Termination**: The recursion appears logically sound with proper base cases
4. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or neural network integration (DeepProbLog) are used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (would work in standard Prolog)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty list input would work (base case exists)
   - Non-list input would fail silently
   - Performance with large lists could be problematic due to O(nÂ²) complexity

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog incompatible conditional operator | Complete failure | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible control structure |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to deterministic sorting | Add probabilistic facts or weighted alternatives |
| 3 | No input validation | May fail unexpectedly | Add type checking for list inputs |

**Recommendations**:
1. Rewrite the conditional using ProbLog-compatible constructs (e.g., separate clauses)
2. Consider adding probabilistic elements if uncertainty in sorting is needed
3. Add input validation for proper list handling

**Word Count**: 398 words

The implementation shows correct bubble sort logic for standard Prolog but requires modification to work in ProbLog's more restricted syntax environment. The core sorting algorithm is sound but needs adaptation for probabilistic contexts.
