# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm. The code attempts to define a `bubblesort/3` predicate that should sort a list through the classic bubble sort methodology. The evaluation focuses on functionality, error analysis, and compliance with Problog requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test case `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))` failed with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubble/2' at 1:31.
```
No tests passed as the implementation is incomplete. The main predicate `bubble/2` required by the sorting algorithm is missing.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (entire single line implementation) which calls the undefined `bubble/2` predicate. The critical issues are:
1. Missing implementation of `bubble/2` (line 1)
2. The sorting logic cannot proceed without this core component

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation fails due to:
1. **Logical incompleteness**: The algorithm requires a `bubble/2` predicate to perform the fundamental bubble operation (comparing and swapping adjacent elements), which is not implemented
2. **Recursive structure**: While the recursion pattern in `bubblesort/3` appears correct, it cannot function without the base operation
3. **ProbLog compliance**: No probabilistic elements or neural network integrations (DeepProbLog features) are present in the current implementation

## Overall Analysis
The current implementation does not meet requirements because:
1. **Functional requirements**: The sorting algorithm is incomplete and non-functional
2. **Edge cases**: The implementation doesn't handle:
   - Empty lists
   - Single-element lists
   - Already sorted lists
   - Non-list inputs
3. **ProbLog features**: No probabilistic reasoning or neural network integration is implemented

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `bubble/2` predicate | Entire sort fails | Implement the bubble operation that compares/swaps adjacent elements |
| 2 | No base case handling | Potential infinite recursion | Add explicit handling for empty/single-element lists |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Doesn't utilize ProbLog features | Consider adding probabilistic comparisons if needed |
| 4 | No input validation | May crash on non-list inputs | Add type checking for list inputs |

```prolog
% Suggested minimal bubble/2 implementation
bubble([X,Y|T], [Y,X|T]) :- X > Y.
bubble([X|T], [X|T1]) :- bubble(T, T1).
```

The implementation requires significant work to become functional. The core sorting logic is missing, and no ProbLog-specific features are currently utilized. A complete implementation would need both the missing `bubble/2` predicate and proper handling of edge cases.
