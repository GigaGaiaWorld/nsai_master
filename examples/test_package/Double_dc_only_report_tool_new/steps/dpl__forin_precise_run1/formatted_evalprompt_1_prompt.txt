</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
- The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted output with probability 1.0
- All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly:
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (requirement 1)
2. Inserts the head element into the sorted list (requirement 2)

The implementation contains no probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no expansion predicates needed verification.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - Base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) correctly handles empty lists
   - Recursive case properly decomposes the list and reconstructs it sorted
   - `insert_element/3` correctly places elements in order through pattern matching

2. **Recursive Termination:**
   - Recursion terminates when input list is empty
   - Each recursive call processes a smaller sublist (tail recursion)

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this implementation
- The computation returned a deterministic result (probability 1.0)
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized in this implementation
- Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty list input: Handled by base case
2. Single-element list: Handled through recursive base case
3. Already sorted list: Properly handled by insertion logic
4. Duplicate elements: Correctly maintained through `=<` comparison

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Could add input validation for non-list inputs
2. Could extend to probabilistic sorting with weighted elements
3. Could optimize tail recursion for very large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation correctly follows insertion sort algorithm principles and handles all specified requirements. While currently limited to classical Prolog functionality, it provides a solid foundation that could be extended with ProbLog's probabilistic features if needed.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
