# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
- The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted output with probability 1.0
- All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly:
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (requirement 1)
2. Inserts the head element into the sorted list (requirement 2)

The implementation contains no probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no expansion predicates needed verification.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - Base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) correctly handles empty lists
   - Recursive case properly decomposes the list and reconstructs it sorted
   - `insert_element/3` correctly places elements in order through pattern matching

2. **Recursive Termination:**
   - Recursion terminates when input list is empty
   - Each recursive call processes a smaller sublist (tail recursion)

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this implementation
- The computation returned a deterministic result (probability 1.0)
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized in this implementation
- Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty list input: Handled by base case
2. Single-element list: Handled through recursive base case
3. Already sorted list: Properly handled by insertion logic
4. Duplicate elements: Correctly maintained through `=<` comparison

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Could add input validation for non-list inputs
2. Could extend to probabilistic sorting with weighted elements
3. Could optimize tail recursion for very large lists

## Error Summary

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation correctly follows insertion sort algorithm principles and handles all specified requirements. While currently limited to classical Prolog functionality, it provides a solid foundation that could be extended with ProbLog's probabilistic features if needed.
