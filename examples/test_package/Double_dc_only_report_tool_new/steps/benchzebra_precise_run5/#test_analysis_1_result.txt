# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code aims to determine the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given constraints, identifying who owns the zebra and who drinks water.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows:
```
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,water,kools,fox), 
       house(ukrainian,blue,tea,chesterfields,horse), 
       house(english,red,milk,winstons,snail), 
       house(spanish,ivory,orange_juice,lucky_strikes,dog), 
       house(japanese,green,coffee,parliaments,zebra)]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The solution correctly satisfies all constraints:
1. Norwegian in first house
2. Milk in middle house
3. Correct color/drink/smoke/pet assignments
4. All adjacency requirements (green/ivory, kools/horse, etc.)
5. Zebra and water correctly placed

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. All expansion predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical ProbLog reasoning:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All 15 constraints are properly encoded
2. **Recursive Termination**: Helper predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`) have proper base cases
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: Not heavily used here (all deterministic), but the 1.0000 probability indicates confidence
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (no neural network integration required)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully satisfied
- Probabilistic reasoning: Basic satisfaction (though not heavily utilized)
- Neural network integration: Not required

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. House ordering is strictly enforced
2. All attributes are properly constrained
3. No undefined variables in final solution
4. Recursion depth is limited (5 houses)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation successfully solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints satisfied. The code is well-structured and demonstrates proper use of ProbLog for constraint satisfaction problems. No modifications are needed for this classical puzzle solution.
