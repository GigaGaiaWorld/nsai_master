# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly encoded.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows one successful solution:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
      house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
      house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
      house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
      house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The solution satisfies all 15 constraints encoded in the puzzle, with a probability of 1.0 indicating deterministic satisfaction.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All constraints were properly encoded and satisfied:
1. Red house/English owner (769EF692)
2. Spanish owner has dog (430FAC43)
3. Green house drinks coffee (F5F641BC)
4. Snail owner smokes Winstons (3127CC36)
5. Middle house drinks milk (4AC08146)
6. Norwegian next to blue house (D316E87D)
7. Zebra ownership (CFE3727A)
8. Water drinking (87D90A3D)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly handles:
- Classical Prolog constraints through proper use of `my_member`, `right_of`, and `next_to` predicates
- All recursive cases terminate properly due to proper list handling
- No probabilistic facts or neural network components were used (pure logical solution)
- All constraints are properly conjuncted in the main `zebra` predicate

The solution demonstrates correct logical reasoning:
- House positions are properly constrained (e.g., milk in middle house)
- Relative positions are enforced (green right of ivory)
- Neighbor constraints work correctly (Norwegian next to blue house)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Fully satisfied with correct constraint solving
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not utilized (pure logical solution)
3. **Neural network integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases handled correctly:
- All houses are properly initialized with 5 slots
- Position constraints work at boundaries
- No infinite recursion occurs
- All member checks are exhaustive

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete, solving the classic Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly encoded and satisfied. The solution demonstrates proper use of Prolog-style constraint solving without any probabilistic or neural network extensions.
