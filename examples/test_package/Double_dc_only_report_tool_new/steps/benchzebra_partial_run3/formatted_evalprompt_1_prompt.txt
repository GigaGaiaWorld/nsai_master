</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly encoded.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows one successful solution:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
      house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
      house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
      house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
      house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The solution satisfies all 15 constraints encoded in the puzzle, with a probability of 1.0 indicating deterministic satisfaction.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All constraints were properly encoded and satisfied:
1. Red house/English owner (769EF692)
2. Spanish owner has dog (430FAC43)
3. Green house drinks coffee (F5F641BC)
4. Snail owner smokes Winstons (3127CC36)
5. Middle house drinks milk (4AC08146)
6. Norwegian next to blue house (D316E87D)
7. Zebra ownership (CFE3727A)
8. Water drinking (87D90A3D)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly handles:
- Classical Prolog constraints through proper use of `my_member`, `right_of`, and `next_to` predicates
- All recursive cases terminate properly due to proper list handling
- No probabilistic facts or neural network components were used (pure logical solution)
- All constraints are properly conjuncted in the main `zebra` predicate

The solution demonstrates correct logical reasoning:
- House positions are properly constrained (e.g., milk in middle house)
- Relative positions are enforced (green right of ivory)
- Neighbor constraints work correctly (Norwegian next to blue house)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Fully satisfied with correct constraint solving
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not utilized (pure logical solution)
3. **Neural network integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases handled correctly:
- All houses are properly initialized with 5 slots
- Position constraints work at boundaries
- No infinite recursion occurs
- All member checks are exhaustive

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete, solving the classic Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly encoded and satisfied. The solution demonstrates proper use of Prolog-style constraint solving without any probabilistic or neural network extensions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
