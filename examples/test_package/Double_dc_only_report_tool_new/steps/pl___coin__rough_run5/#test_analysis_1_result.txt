# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that simulates coin tossing and calculates the probability distribution of heads when tossing 4 biased coins (P(heads)=0.8). The program uses recursive rules to accumulate results and probabilistic facts to model coin outcomes.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 heads when tossing 4 coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly follow the binomial distribution with parameters n=4 and p=0.8, where:
- P(4 heads) = 0.8⁴ = 0.4096
- P(3 heads) = 4 × 0.8³ × 0.2 = 0.4096
- P(2 heads) = 6 × 0.8² × 0.2² = 0.1536
- P(1 head) = 4 × 0.8 × 0.2³ = 0.0256
- P(0 heads) = 0.2⁴ = 0.0016

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly handles:
1. Base case termination (line 3)
2. Probabilistic coin toss (lines 6-10)
3. Negative case handling (lines 11-14)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
1. Each coin toss is independent with P(heads)=0.8
2. The negation case `\+ coin(CNT)` properly accounts for tails (P=0.2)
3. Recursion correctly accumulates counts without side effects
4. The final query properly initializes the counter (line 16)

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correct recursive accumulation
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper handling of probabilistic facts
3. **Edge cases**: Handles CNT=0 and maintains counter integrity

Potential improvements:
1. Could parameterize the number of coins (currently hardcoded to 4)
2. Could add input validation
3. Could optimize tail recursion

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete for the specified requirements. The probabilistic calculations match expected binomial distribution results for 4 trials with P=0.8.
