</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /) from image identifiers, converts them to symbols, then evaluates the mathematical expression. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, predicate definitions, and handling of arithmetic operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test query was:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:** The query returned 0.0000 probability, indicating a complete failure to evaluate the expression "2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7".

## Failure Localization
1. **Main Failure Point**: The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete - it only handles single-number cases (`parse([N], R)`) but lacks rules for processing operator expressions.

2. **Missing Functionality**: The code lacks parsing rules for:
   - Addition expressions (`[N1,+|T]`)
   - Subtraction expressions (`[N1,-|T]`)
   - Multiplication expressions (`[N1,*|T]`)
   - Division expressions (`[N1,/|T]`)
   - Compound expressions with operator precedence

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The current implementation cannot parse any arithmetic expressions beyond single numbers due to missing operator handling rules.

2. **Recursive Termination**: While the base case (`parse([N], R)`) is correctly defined, the recursive cases for operators are completely missing.

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: The program uses deterministic facts (`detect_number`, `detect_operator`) and doesn't utilize probabilistic reasoning features. The 0.0000 result suggests the query didn't match any valid probabilistic derivation path.

4. **DeepProbLog Integration**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`) or tensor operations are present. "DeepProbLog feature not used".

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Basic number detection works
   - Symbol conversion works for individual elements
   - Fails to meet the arithmetic expression parsing requirement

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - Operator precedence (current implementation would need parentheses handling)
   - Invalid expression formats
   - Division by zero
   - Non-list inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing operator parsing rules | Cannot evaluate expressions | Implement parse rules for all operators |
| 2 | No operator precedence handling | Incorrect evaluation order | Add parentheses support or precedence rules |
| 3 | No error handling | Crashes on invalid input | Add input validation |
| 4 | Unused probabilistic features | Limited functionality | Consider adding uncertainty to detections |

```prolog
% Suggested additions to fix main issues:
parse([N1,+|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 + R2).
parse([N1,-|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 - R2). 
parse([N1,*|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 * R2).
parse([N1,/|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 / R2).
```

The current implementation fails to meet its core requirement of evaluating arithmetic expressions. The main fix needed is implementing the operator parsing rules with proper recursive evaluation. Additional improvements would include operator precedence handling and input validation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
