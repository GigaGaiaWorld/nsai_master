# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /) from image identifiers, converts them to symbols, then evaluates the mathematical expression. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, predicate definitions, and handling of arithmetic operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test query was:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:** The query returned 0.0000 probability, indicating a complete failure to evaluate the expression "2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7".

## Failure Localization
1. **Main Failure Point**: The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete - it only handles single-number cases (`parse([N], R)`) but lacks rules for processing operator expressions.

2. **Missing Functionality**: The code lacks parsing rules for:
   - Addition expressions (`[N1,+|T]`)
   - Subtraction expressions (`[N1,-|T]`)
   - Multiplication expressions (`[N1,*|T]`)
   - Division expressions (`[N1,/|T]`)
   - Compound expressions with operator precedence

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The current implementation cannot parse any arithmetic expressions beyond single numbers due to missing operator handling rules.

2. **Recursive Termination**: While the base case (`parse([N], R)`) is correctly defined, the recursive cases for operators are completely missing.

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: The program uses deterministic facts (`detect_number`, `detect_operator`) and doesn't utilize probabilistic reasoning features. The 0.0000 result suggests the query didn't match any valid probabilistic derivation path.

4. **DeepProbLog Integration**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`) or tensor operations are present. "DeepProbLog feature not used".

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Basic number detection works
   - Symbol conversion works for individual elements
   - Fails to meet the arithmetic expression parsing requirement

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - Operator precedence (current implementation would need parentheses handling)
   - Invalid expression formats
   - Division by zero
   - Non-list inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing operator parsing rules | Cannot evaluate expressions | Implement parse rules for all operators |
| 2 | No operator precedence handling | Incorrect evaluation order | Add parentheses support or precedence rules |
| 3 | No error handling | Crashes on invalid input | Add input validation |
| 4 | Unused probabilistic features | Limited functionality | Consider adding uncertainty to detections |

```prolog
% Suggested additions to fix main issues:
parse([N1,+|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 + R2).
parse([N1,-|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 - R2). 
parse([N1,*|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 * R2).
parse([N1,/|T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 / R2).
```

The current implementation fails to meet its core requirement of evaluating arithmetic expressions. The main fix needed is implementing the operator parsing rules with proper recursive evaluation. Additional improvements would include operator precedence handling and input validation.
