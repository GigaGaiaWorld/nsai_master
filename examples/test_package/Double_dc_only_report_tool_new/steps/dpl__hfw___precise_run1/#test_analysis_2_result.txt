# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to translate images into mathematical symbols, then evaluates the expressions through recursive parsing.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided evaluates the expression: `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` which should yield `-13.833...` but the actual result was `-0.25`.

**Test Query:**
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, 
      image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Actual Result:**
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, 
           image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],-0.25) = 1.0000
```

**Expected Result:**
The correct evaluation should be `-13.833...` (2/6 - 14)

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the parsing logic (lines 22-35 in the code block). The current implementation doesn't handle operator precedence correctly, evaluating operations strictly left-to-right without considering mathematical precedence rules.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The parser evaluates operations in strict left-to-right order (2/3 = 0.666, +3 = 3.666, -2 = 1.666, *7 = 11.666)
   - Missing parentheses handling causes incorrect evaluation order
   - The `almost_equal/2` predicate works correctly but isn't the source of the error

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - All detections are certain (probability 1.0)
   - DeepProbLog features are not used in this code

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Basic arithmetic operations are implemented but fail on precedence
- Classical reasoning works for simple cases but fails on complex expressions
- No probabilistic reasoning or neural network integration is present

**Edge Cases:**
- No handling for division by zero (though check exists in division rule)
- No input validation for non-list inputs
- No protection against stack overflow from deep recursion
- No handling for malformed expressions (e.g., two operators in sequence)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing operator precedence | Major evaluation errors | Implement proper precedence handling |
| 2 | No parentheses support | Cannot express complex operations | Add parentheses parsing |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking |
| 4 | No error handling | Silent failures on bad input | Add failure cases |

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement proper operator precedence (PEMDAS rules)
2. Add parentheses support for grouping sub-expressions
3. Include input validation predicates
4. Add error handling for division by zero and malformed expressions

The current implementation works for simple left-to-right expressions but fails to handle standard arithmetic evaluation order. The core logic needs restructuring to properly handle operator precedence and expression grouping.
