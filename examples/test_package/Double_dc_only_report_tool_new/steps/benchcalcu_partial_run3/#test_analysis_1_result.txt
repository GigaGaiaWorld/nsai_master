# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle where AB + BCD = CDE. The solution must satisfy digit constraints (no leading zeros, all digits unique) and arithmetic correctness. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, test results, and compliance with ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The program produced 10 valid solutions, all with probability 1.0000:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies:
1. Leading digit constraints (A,B,C ≠ 0)
2. Correct column-wise addition with carry propagation
3. All digits are unique per solution

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. All code blocks function as intended:
- `leftdigit/1` constraints (Hash F91C6038)
- `sumdigit/5` arithmetic (Hashes A8860BE4, 702CD838, 57FD427B)
- `all_different/1` uniqueness check (Hash 0DE8749E)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Aspects:**
1. Logical correctness verified through:
   - Proper base case (`all_different([])`)
   - Correct recursive case in `all_different/1`
   - Termination guaranteed by list length reduction

2. Arithmetic constraints:
   - `sumdigit/5` correctly handles both carry scenarios (X < 10 and X ≥ 10)
   - Carry propagation flows correctly through columns

**ProbLog Aspects:**
- All solutions have probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic facts
- No probabilistic facts or rules present in this classical puzzle
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Fully satisfied with correct puzzle solutions
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (deterministic problem)
3. Neural integration: Not required for this task

**Edge Cases Verified:**
1. Leading zero prevention works (A,B,C ≠ 0)
2. Handles all carry scenarios (0 or 1)
3. Rejects solutions with duplicate digits
4. No performance issues (small search space)

The implementation correctly solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle with proper constraints handling and arithmetic validation. For future extensions, probabilistic constraints could be added to model digit selection uncertainty.
