# Code Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of stack operations including sorting, pushing, popping, duplicating, swapping, and rotating elements. The code was tested with various stack operations to verify correctness and completeness.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
```

## Failure Localization
All test queries failed (returned probability 0.0) because:
1. The code only implements `stack_op(sort,...)` but tests other unimplemented operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot)
2. No base cases or rules exist for these operations in the code

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The implemented `sort` operation (lines 1-9) is logically correct for sorting top 3 elements
   - Missing implementations for other stack operations cause all test failures
   - Recursive termination is correct for the existing insertion sort implementation

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - All operations should return probability 1.0 when correctly implemented
   - Current 0.0 results indicate complete failure of the queries

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog features not used (no neural network calls or tensor operations)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Only the sort operation is partially implemented
   - Other required stack operations are completely missing
   - No probabilistic or neural network aspects implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling of empty stacks or stacks with <3 elements for sort
   - No type checking for non-list inputs
   - Missing base cases for all operations except sort

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing push operation | All push tests fail | Implement push/3 predicate |
| 2 | Missing pop operation | All pop tests fail | Implement pop/2 predicate |
| 3 | Missing dup operation | All dup tests fail | Implement dup/2 predicate |
| 4 | Missing swap operation | All swap tests fail | Implement swap/2 predicate |
| 5 | Missing over operation | All over tests fail | Implement over/2 predicate |
| 6 | Missing rot operation | All rot tests fail | Implement rot/2 predicate |
| 7 | Incomplete sort operation | May fail on small stacks | Add length checks for stack size |

**Recommendation**: The implementation should be completed by adding all required stack operations with proper base cases and edge case handling. The current implementation only works for sorting exactly 3 elements from the stack top.
