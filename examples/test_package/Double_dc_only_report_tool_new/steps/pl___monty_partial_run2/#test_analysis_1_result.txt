# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the contestant decides whether to keep their original choice or switch. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning and correct implementation of the game's rules.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All test results match the expected probabilities:
- Equal 1/3 probability for each door having the prize
- Certain selection of door 1
- 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the original choice
- 2/3 probability of winning by switching

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results correctly reflect the known probabilities of the Monty Hall problem.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
1. Random prize placement (lines 1-2)
2. Door selection (line 3)
3. Host behavior when both remaining doors are empty (lines 6-9)
4. Host behavior when one remaining door has a prize (lines 11-14)
5. Winning conditions for both strategies (lines 16-21)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
1. Prize distribution uses proper disjoint probabilities summing to 1
2. The `open_door` rules correctly implement the host's behavior:
   - When both unselected doors are empty: random selection (P=0.5 for each)
   - When one unselected door has a prize: deterministic selection of empty door
3. Winning probabilities correctly compute as:
   - P(win_keep) = P(initial correct choice) = 1/3
   - P(win_switch) = P(initial wrong choice) = 2/3

The code properly handles all possible prize configurations and host behaviors.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models the game rules and constraints
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes probabilities for all scenarios
3. **Neural network integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used (not required for this problem)

Edge cases properly handled:
- All possible prize locations covered
- Host behavior covers all possible door configurations
- Member predicate safely handles list operations

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | - |

The implementation is correct and complete for the Monty Hall problem specification. No errors or improvements were identified. The code demonstrates proper use of ProbLog for probabilistic modeling of a well-known probability puzzle.
