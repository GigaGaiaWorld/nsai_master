# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code uses logical constraints to determine the arrangement of houses with specific attributes. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and analyze its compliance with ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned a single solution with probability 1.0000:
```
[house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
 house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
 house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
 house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
 house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution satisfies all 15 constraints of the original puzzle:
1. Englishman in red house
2. Spaniard owns dog
3. Coffee in green house
4. Ukrainian drinks tea
5. Green house immediately to right of ivory
6. Winston smoker owns snails
7. Kools smoked in yellow house
8. Milk in middle house
9. Norwegian in first house
10. Chesterfields next to fox
11. Kools next to horse
12. Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice
13. Japanese smokes Parliaments
14. Norwegian next to blue house
15. Zebra and water locations correctly identified

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and support the main puzzle constraints.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical reasoning:
1. **Classical Prolog aspects**:
   - All recursive predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`) have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - Constraints are properly ordered for efficient solving
   - No infinite recursion risks

2. **ProbLog aspects**:
   - The solution uses deterministic facts (probability 1.0)
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - No negation or implication operations required

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used" - no neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor`) present

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets classical reasoning requirements:
- Correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints
- Efficient house arrangement through constraint ordering
- Proper use of helper predicates

**Edge cases considered**:
- List boundaries handled in `right_of/3` (line 1 checks adjacent positions)
- Empty list case implicitly handled through pattern matching
- All puzzle constraints are mutually satisfiable

**Potential improvements**:
- Could add probabilistic variations (e.g., uncertain attributes)
- Could include explanatory comments for each constraint

% Correct implementation verified:
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools),
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields),
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons),
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes),
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)])
```

The evaluation confirms the code correctly implements the Zebra Puzzle solution using deterministic ProbLog reasoning with all constraints properly satisfied.
