# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided population and area data, then finds country pairs where one density is slightly higher than another (within a 5% margin).

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 successful query results:
```
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All returned queries correctly identify country pairs where the first country's density is between 1.00-1.05 times the second country's density, as specified by the comparison logic in the `query_pop` predicate.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The program correctly implements:
1. Population density calculation (`density/2` predicate)
2. Comparative query logic (`query_pop/1` predicate)
3. All supporting facts (`pop/2` and `area/2` predicates)

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog functionality:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The density calculation `D is (P*100)//A` properly computes people per 1000 square miles
2. **Comparison Logic**: The inequality checks `D1 > D2` and `20*D1 < 21*D2` correctly implement the 5% margin requirement
3. **Termination**: The program terminates as it has finite facts and no recursion

Probabilistic aspects:
- The program uses classical Prolog without probabilistic features
- No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are used
- All results show probability 1.0000 indicating deterministic facts

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. The integer division in density calculation could cause rounding errors, but this is acceptable for the approximate comparison
2. All country pairs are explicitly listed - no undefined cases
3. Input validation is not needed as the query structure is fixed

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add comments explaining the 5% margin calculation
2. Consider floating-point division for more precise comparisons
3. Add more countries for comprehensive testing

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The program correctly implements its specified functionality for finding countries with similar population densities. All test cases pass validation, demonstrating correct implementation of the comparison logic and density calculations.
