# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that simulates coin tossing with a biased coin (probability of heads = 0.8). The program recursively counts the number of heads (S) when tossing CNT independent coins, then queries the probability distribution for tossing 4 coins.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 heads when tossing 4 coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```
All tests passed (no failures) as these results correctly match the expected binomial distribution with p=0.8 and n=4.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly accumulates the count of heads while respecting the probabilistic nature of each coin toss.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: 
   - The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` correctly terminates recursion
   - The recursive cases properly handle both success (`coin(CNT)`) and failure (`\+ coin(CNT)`) scenarios

2. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - The probability of heads (0.8) is correctly defined in `coin(C)`
   - The negation probability (0.2) is implicitly handled via `\+ coin(CNT)`
   - Results show correct application of binomial probability formula: P(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

3. **DeepProbLog Features**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Correct recursive counting implementation
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Proper handling of probabilistic facts and their combinations
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable (not required)

2. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - Base case (CNT=0) properly terminates recursion
   - Negative CNT values are implicitly handled by the `CNT > 0` checks
   - The implementation maintains proper probability normalization

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |

| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the probabilistic coin tossing scenario and produces mathematically accurate results. The recursive approach efficiently handles the counting while maintaining proper probability calculations. No modifications are needed for this implementation.
