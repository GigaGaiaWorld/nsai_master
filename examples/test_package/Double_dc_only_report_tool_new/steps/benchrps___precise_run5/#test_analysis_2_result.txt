# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The code should correctly calculate round results and determine the overall winner.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
```
Error: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
The test query was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate implementation (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. An incomplete predicate definition (cut off mid-implementation)
2. Malformed conditional logic using `->/2` operator
3. The correct implementation (provided in the `<Langda>` block) wasn't properly integrated

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/1` is correctly implemented
2. The base cases for empty lists are properly defined
3. The win/lose/draw logic in `result/3` is logically sound

The main issues are:
1. Syntax error in the conditional expression
2. Incomplete predicate definition
3. The correct implementation (hash 4E6CE90A) wasn't used

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (core logic works but main predicate fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts/rules)
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases:**
1. Non-list inputs aren't handled
2. Uneven move lists would cause failure
3. Invalid moves would not be validated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Critical failure | Use the correct implementation from <Langda> block |
| 2 | Malformed conditional logic | Syntax error | Properly format if-then-else structure |
| 3 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation checks |

**Correct Implementation:**
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The evaluation shows the core game logic is sound, but the main predicate implementation contains critical syntax errors. Using the provided correct implementation (hash 4E6CE90A) would resolve the issues. Additional input validation would improve robustness.
