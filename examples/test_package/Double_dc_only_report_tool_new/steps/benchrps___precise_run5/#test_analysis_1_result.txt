# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning aspects. The code defines game rules, calculates round results, computes scores, and determines the overall winner between two players.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`
2. **Error Location**: Line 41, character 77
3. **Problematic Code**: The `determine_winner` predicate definition is incomplete and contains a syntax error in the conditional statement (->/2 operator)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Issues**:
   - The `determine_winner` predicate is malformed with improper line breaks and incomplete syntax
   - The conditional operator (->/2) is not properly formatted in the predicate body
   - The recursive termination in `compute_score` is correct, but the main predicate fails before reaching it

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - All computations are purely deterministic

3. **DeepProbLog Features**:
   - DeepProbLog features (neural networks, tensors) are not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning is partially implemented but fails at the main predicate
   - Probabilistic reasoning requirements are not applicable
   - Neural network integration is not required

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Uneven move lists between players would cause issues
   - Invalid moves would not be properly validated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed `determine_winner` predicate | Entire program fails to execute | Fix predicate formatting and conditional syntax |
| 2 | Incomplete code blocks | Partial functionality | Ensure all code blocks are properly closed |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation checks |

## Corrected Code
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The main issue is a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate. The corrected version properly formats the conditional statements and maintains logical flow. All other predicates (move/1, beats/2, result/3, play/3, compute_score/2) are correctly implemented and would function as intended if not for this syntax error.
