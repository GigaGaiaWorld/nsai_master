<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning aspects. The code defines game rules, calculates round results, computes scores, and determines the overall winner between two players.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`
2. **Error Location**: Line 41, character 77
3. **Problematic Code**: The `determine_winner` predicate definition is incomplete and contains a syntax error in the conditional statement (->/2 operator)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Issues**:
   - The `determine_winner` predicate is malformed with improper line breaks and incomplete syntax
   - The conditional operator (->/2) is not properly formatted in the predicate body
   - The recursive termination in `compute_score` is correct, but the main predicate fails before reaching it

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - All computations are purely deterministic

3. **DeepProbLog Features**:
   - DeepProbLog features (neural networks, tensors) are not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning is partially implemented but fails at the main predicate
   - Probabilistic reasoning requirements are not applicable
   - Neural network integration is not required

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Uneven move lists between players would cause issues
   - Invalid moves would not be properly validated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed `determine_winner` predicate | Entire program fails to execute | Fix predicate formatting and conditional syntax |
| 2 | Incomplete code blocks | Partial functionality | Ensure all code blocks are properly closed |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation checks |

## Corrected Code
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The main issue is a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate. The corrected version properly formats the conditional statements and maintains logical flow. All other predicates (move/1, beats/2, result/3, play/3, compute_score/2) are correctly implemented and would function as intended if not for this syntax error.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
