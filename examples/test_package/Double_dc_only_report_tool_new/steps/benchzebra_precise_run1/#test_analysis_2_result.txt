# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given clues about nationalities, colors, drinks, cigarettes, and pets. The solution must satisfy all constraints simultaneously.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned a single solution with probability 1.0000:
```
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,water,kools,fox), 
       house(ukrainian,blue,tea,chesterfields,horse), 
       house(english,red,milk,winstons,snail), 
       house(spanish,ivory,orange_juice,lucky_strikes,dog), 
       house(japanese,green,coffee,parliaments,zebra)]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution satisfies all 15 constraints from the puzzle requirements:
1. English in red house ✓
2. Spanish has dog ✓
3. Green house drinks coffee ✓
4. Ukrainian drinks tea ✓
5. Green right of ivory ✓
6. Winstons smoker has snails ✓
7. Yellow house smokes Kools ✓
8. Middle house drinks milk ✓
9. First house is Norwegian ✓
10. Chesterfields next to fox ✓
11. Kools next to horse ✓
12. Orange juice with Lucky Strikes ✓
13. Japanese smoke Parliaments ✓
14. Norwegian next to blue ✓
15. Zebra and water drinker exist ✓

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and support both classical and probabilistic reasoning.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation successfully handles:
- **Classical Prolog aspects**: All constraints are implemented as deterministic facts and rules with proper recursive termination
- **Probabilistic aspects**: Though not explicitly using probabilities here, the structure supports probabilistic extensions (all constraints would work with probabilistic facts)
- **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation (no neural network integration)

Key successful elements:
1. Correct spatial relationships via `right_of/3` (lines 3-4) and `next_to/3` (lines 5-7)
2. Proper constraint ordering that enables efficient solving
3. Complete coverage of all puzzle requirements

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Structure supports it but not utilized
- Neural network integration: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used)

**Edge cases considered:**
- House ordering constraints properly handle boundary cases
- Member checking works for all positions
- Spatial relationships don't assume fixed positions

**Potential improvements:**
1. Could add probabilistic versions of constraints
2. Could optimize ordering of constraints for performance
3. Could add validation checks for house structure

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints satisfied. The code structure is clean and would support probabilistic extensions if needed.
