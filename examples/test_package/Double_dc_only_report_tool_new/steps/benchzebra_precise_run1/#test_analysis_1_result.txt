# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code attempts to solve the puzzle by defining constraints on house attributes (nationality, color, beverage, cigarette, pet) and their relative positions. The purpose is to verify logical correctness and proper ProbLog implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1
```

The system cannot find the definition for the `member/2` predicate, which is essential for checking house attributes. This prevents any successful query execution.

## Failure Localization
- **Failed Query**: Entire `zebra(Houses)` query fails to execute
- **Error Location**: Line 4 (first use of `member/2`)
- **Root Cause**: Missing `member/2` predicate definition while the code attempts to use it
- **Expected Behavior**: The code should either:
  1. Use the existing `my_member/2` predicate consistently, or
  2. Include a proper `member/2` definition

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Issues**:
   - The code defines `my_member/2` but tries to use `member/2`
   - All other predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) are correctly defined
   - The logical constraints appear correct but cannot be evaluated due to the missing predicate

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The code is purely deterministic logical programming
   - DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

3. **Termination Analysis**:
   - The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) all have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - List processing would terminate correctly if the member predicate issue were fixed

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct constraints but execution fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases**:
- The code handles the fixed 5-house case but doesn't validate input structure
- No protection against malformed house structures
- Recursion depth is limited by fixed house count (5), so performance isn't an issue

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure | Replace with `my_member/2` or add `member/2` definition |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements used | Limited to classical solving | Consider adding probabilistic constraints if needed |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Not required for this puzzle |

**Recommended Fix**:
```prolog
% Replace all instances of member/2 with my_member/2
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(spanish, _, _, _, dog), Houses),
    % ... (rest of the constraints)
```

The core logic appears sound, but the implementation cannot execute due to the basic predicate resolution failure. Fixing the member predicate issue should enable successful puzzle solving.
