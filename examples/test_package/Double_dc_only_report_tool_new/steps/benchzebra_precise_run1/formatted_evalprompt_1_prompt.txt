<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code attempts to solve the puzzle by defining constraints on house attributes (nationality, color, beverage, cigarette, pet) and their relative positions. The purpose is to verify logical correctness and proper ProbLog implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1
```

The system cannot find the definition for the `member/2` predicate, which is essential for checking house attributes. This prevents any successful query execution.

## Failure Localization
- **Failed Query**: Entire `zebra(Houses)` query fails to execute
- **Error Location**: Line 4 (first use of `member/2`)
- **Root Cause**: Missing `member/2` predicate definition while the code attempts to use it
- **Expected Behavior**: The code should either:
  1. Use the existing `my_member/2` predicate consistently, or
  2. Include a proper `member/2` definition

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Issues**:
   - The code defines `my_member/2` but tries to use `member/2`
   - All other predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) are correctly defined
   - The logical constraints appear correct but cannot be evaluated due to the missing predicate

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The code is purely deterministic logical programming
   - DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

3. **Termination Analysis**:
   - The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) all have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - List processing would terminate correctly if the member predicate issue were fixed

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct constraints but execution fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases**:
- The code handles the fixed 5-house case but doesn't validate input structure
- No protection against malformed house structures
- Recursion depth is limited by fixed house count (5), so performance isn't an issue

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure | Replace with `my_member/2` or add `member/2` definition |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements used | Limited to classical solving | Consider adding probabilistic constraints if needed |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Not required for this puzzle |

**Recommended Fix**:
```prolog
% Replace all instances of member/2 with my_member/2
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(spanish, _, _, _, dog), Houses),
    % ... (rest of the constraints)
```

The core logic appears sound, but the implementation cannot execute due to the basic predicate resolution failure. Fixing the member predicate issue should enable successful puzzle solving.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
