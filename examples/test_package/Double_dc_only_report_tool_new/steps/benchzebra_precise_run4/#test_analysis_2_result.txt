# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code aims to determine the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given constraints, identifying who owns the zebra and who drinks water.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows a single successful query:
```
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,fox,water,kools), 
       house(ukrainian,blue,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(english,red,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(spanish,ivory,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(japanese,green,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as verified by the complete match between the output and requirements.

## Failure Localization
Not applicable - All constraints are properly satisfied in the solution. The helper predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and support the main logic.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - All puzzle constraints are properly translated into Prolog predicates
   - The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) correctly handle list traversal
   - Base cases and recursive cases are properly defined for termination

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - The solution uses classical Prolog reasoning (probability = 1.0000)
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

3. **Constraint Satisfaction**:
   - House positions match all requirements (Norwegian first, milk in middle)
   - All attribute combinations satisfy the given rules
   - Spatial relationships (right_of, next_to) are correctly maintained

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized in this solution
   - Neural network integration: Not present

2. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - List structure is properly handled in all predicates
   - Recursion depth is fixed (5 houses) so no performance issues
   - All attribute domains are properly constrained

3. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Could add probabilistic versions of constraints
   - Could implement as a probabilistic graph for alternative solutions
   - Could add input validation for house list structure

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Solution is correct |
| 2 | No probabilistic aspects | Limited to classical solution | Add probabilistic constraints |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Consider NN-based constraint solving |

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle using classical Prolog techniques with all constraints properly satisfied. While it doesn't utilize ProbLog's probabilistic capabilities or DeepProbLog features, it serves as a correct and complete logical solution to the problem.
