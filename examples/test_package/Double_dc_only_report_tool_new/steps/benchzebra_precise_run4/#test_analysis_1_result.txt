# Problog Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given clues. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and identify any errors in the Problog code.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs because:
1. The code uses `member/2` predicate (line 4) but this predicate is not defined in the provided code
2. While there is a `my_member/2` predicate defined later in the code, it's not being used in the main zebra/1 rule
3. Line number reference points to the first use of `member/2` in the constraints

## Root Cause Analysis
The root cause is a predicate naming inconsistency:
1. Classical Prolog context: The code mixes standard `member/2` calls with a custom `my_member/2` implementation
2. The recursive definitions for `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` appear correct and should terminate properly
3. No probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet functional requirements due to the predicate naming issue. Key observations:
1. **Classical reasoning**: The logical structure of the puzzle constraints appears correct but cannot execute due to the missing predicate
2. **Edge cases**: The code doesn't handle non-list inputs or undefined cases for the house attributes
3. **Performance**: Recursive predicates are properly structured and should perform well for this small problem size

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure to execute | Replace all `member/2` calls with `my_member/2` or properly import the member predicate |
| 2 | Predicate naming inconsistency | Confusion between standard and custom predicates | Consistently use either standard library predicates or custom implementations |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses), 
    my_member(house(spanish, _, dog, _, _), Houses),
    % ... rest of the constraints using my_member instead of member
```

The implementation would work correctly after making this adjustment, as all other logical constraints appear properly structured for solving the zebra puzzle.
