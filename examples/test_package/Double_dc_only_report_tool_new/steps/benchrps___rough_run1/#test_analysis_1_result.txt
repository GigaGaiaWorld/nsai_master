# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on game rule definition, outcome calculation, and winner determination. The code should correctly model the game's win/lose/draw logic and compute match results.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Returned the correct result:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The implementation correctly:
1. Identifies individual round outcomes (win/lose/draw)
2. Calculates the aggregate score
3. Determines the overall winner

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates function as intended:
- `move/1` (lines 3-5) correctly defines valid moves
- `beats/2` (lines 7-9) accurately represents game rules
- `outcome/3` (lines 14-16) properly determines round results
- `play/3` (lines 18-21) correctly processes move lists
- `compute_score/2` (lines 23-26) accurately tallies results
- `determine_winner/3` (lines 27-31) properly identifies the winner

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates sound logical structure:
1. **Classical Prolog aspects**:
   - All predicates are mutually exclusive and exhaustive
   - Recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` has proper base cases
   - Termination is guaranteed for finite move lists

2. **Probabilistic aspects**:
   - The deterministic nature of the game rules means all probabilities are 1.0
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used (pure logical implementation)
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration required)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the functional requirements:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models game rules and computes outcomes
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not required for this deterministic game
- **Neural network integration**: Not applicable to this implementation

Edge case considerations:
1. **Non-list inputs**: Would cause type errors (acceptable for this implementation)
2. **Uneven move lists**: Not handled (should be addressed for robustness)
3. **Invalid moves**: Not validated (could be added with additional checks)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Uneven move lists not handled | May cause errors | Add length check predicate |
| 2 | Invalid moves not validated | Incorrect results possible | Add move validation |
| 3 | DeepProbLog not utilized | N/A | Not required for this task |

The implementation is correct for the given requirements but could be made more robust with additional input validation. The test case provided demonstrates correct functionality for the core game logic.
