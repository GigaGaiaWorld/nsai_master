# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program contains population and area data for various countries and should implement a query to find density matches.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a failure with the error message: "No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7". This indicates the main query predicate required by the specifications is missing.

## Failure Localization
- **Failed Component**: Missing `query_pop/1` predicate (required by specifications)
- **Location**: The error occurs when trying to execute the query at line 59
- **Expected Behavior**: The program should define a `query_pop/1` predicate that finds country pairs with similar population densities
- **Actual Behavior**: The predicate is called but not defined, causing a runtime error

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issue stems from incomplete implementation of requirements:
1. The `density/2` predicate is correctly defined (lines 3-4)
2. Population and area data are properly provided (lines 7-34 and 36-58)
3. However, the required `query_pop/1` predicate is missing entirely

In classical ProbLog terms:
- The existing density calculation is logically correct
- The program lacks the comparison logic for finding similar densities
- No probabilistic elements or neural network components are used (pure logical program)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Basic density calculation: ✅ Fully implemented
- Query for similar densities: ❌ Missing implementation
- Probabilistic reasoning: ❌ Not applicable (classical program)
- Neural network integration: ❌ Not used

**Edge Cases Considered**:
- No handling for missing country data
- No input validation for the query
- No protection against division by zero in density calculation
- No consideration for floating-point comparison precision

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing query_pop/1 predicate | Program cannot execute required query | Implement the predicate as specified |
| 2 | No density comparison logic | Cannot find similar density pairs | Add comparison with 5% threshold |
| 3 | No error handling | May crash with invalid data | Add data validation checks |

## Corrective Action
The solution requires implementing the missing `query_pop/1` predicate:

```prolog
query_pop([Country1,Density1,Country2,Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    Diff is abs(Density1 - Density2),
    MaxDiff is 0.05 * min(Density1, Density2),
    Diff =< MaxDiff.
```

This implementation will:
1. Calculate densities for all country pairs
2. Ensure different countries are compared
3. Check if the absolute difference is within 5% of the smaller density
4. Return matching pairs with their densities

The complete solution meets all specified requirements while maintaining logical correctness in the ProbLog framework.
