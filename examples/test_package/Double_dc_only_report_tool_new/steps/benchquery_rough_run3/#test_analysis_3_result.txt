# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program calculates population density from provided facts about population and area, then finds country pairs meeting the density similarity criterion.

## Test Results Summary
All test cases passed successfully. The program returned 8 correct country pairs with matching density comparisons:

1. `query_pop([china, 2.440828402366864, france, 2.464788732394366]) = 1.0000`
2. `query_pop([indonesia, 2.23859649122807, pakistan, 2.192926045016077]) = 1.0000`
3. `query_pop([pakistan, 2.192926045016077, indonesia, 2.23859649122807]) = 1.0000`
4. `query_pop([mexico, 0.760471204188482, ethiopia, 0.777142857142857]) = 1.0000`
5. `query_pop([italy, 4.775862068965517, philippines, 4.611111111111111]) = 1.0000`
6. `query_pop([france, 2.464788732394366, china, 2.440828402366864]) = 1.0000`
7. `query_pop([philippines, 4.611111111111111, italy, 4.775862068965517]) = 1.0000`
8. `query_pop([ethiopia, 0.777142857142857, mexico, 0.760471204188482]) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). Each result shows:
- Correct country pairs with density values
- Proper bidirectional matching (e.g., China-France and France-China)
- Density differences within the 5% threshold
- Probability 1.0000 indicating deterministic success

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The program's predicates function correctly:

1. `density/2` (Lines 1-3): Correctly calculates density from population and area
2. `query_pop/1` (Lines 4-6): Properly compares densities and enforces the 5% threshold

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct logical behavior:

1. **Classical Prolog Aspects:**
   - The `density` predicate correctly terminates after calculation
   - The `query_pop` rule properly handles inequality (`Country1 \= Country2`)
   - The density comparison formula `abs(Density1 - Density2)/min(Density1, Density2) =< 0.05` is mathematically sound

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The program uses only deterministic facts (no probabilistic facts)
   - All queries return probability 1.0000 as expected
   - No DeepProbLog features (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used

## Overall Analysis
The program fully meets its functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning:**
   - Correctly implements the density calculation and comparison logic
   - Handles all provided country data accurately

2. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - Bidirectional country pairing (A-B and B-A both work)
   - Proper inequality check prevents same-country comparisons
   - Floating-point arithmetic handles density calculations precisely

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - Could add input validation for non-existent countries
   - Might benefit from probabilistic extensions for uncertain data
