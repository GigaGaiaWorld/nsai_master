# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program uses population and area data to calculate densities and compare them across countries.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure:
```
Error: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7
```
The program fails because the required `query_pop/1` predicate is not implemented, despite being specified in the requirements.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Component**: Missing `query_pop/1` predicate implementation
   - Location: Entire program (no implementation found)
   - Expected: A predicate that finds country pairs with density differences ≤ 5%
   - Actual: No implementation exists

2. **Missing Helper Predicate**: The `density/2` predicate exists but isn't sufficient for the required comparison functionality

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The existing `density/2` predicate correctly calculates density (Population/Area)
   - However, the program lacks the comparison logic required by the specification

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this program
   - The error is purely structural (missing predicate)

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog features not used (no neural network components)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Basic density calculation works (partial fulfillment)
   - Core requirement (comparing densities) not implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling for missing population/area data
   - No input validation
   - No protection against division by zero in area

3. **Structural Issues**:
   - Missing required predicate (`query_pop/1`)
   - No comparison logic for density values

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `query_pop/1` predicate | Complete failure | Implement as specified |
| 2 | No density comparison logic | Core functionality missing | Add comparison with 5% threshold |
| 3 | No error handling | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for data completeness |

## Recommended Fix
```prolog
query_pop([Country1,Density1,Country2,Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    abs(Density1 - Density2) / min(Density1, Density2) =< 0.05.
```

This implementation would:
1. Find all country pairs with their densities
2. Ensure different countries are compared
3. Verify the relative difference is ≤ 5%
4. Return the matching pairs with their densities

The complete solution requires approximately 10-15 additional lines of code to fully meet the specified requirements.
