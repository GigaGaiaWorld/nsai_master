</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against functional requirements and identify any potential issues in classical Prolog execution.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorted the input list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with 100% probability.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. Comparison of elements during merge phase

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical Prolog:

1. **Recursive Termination:**
   - Base cases (lines 1-2) properly handle empty and single-element lists
   - Recursive case (lines 3-8) properly splits the list until reaching base cases

2. **Splitting Mechanism:**
   - The `split/3` predicate (lines 9-12) correctly divides lists into equal halves
   - Uses `length/2` and `append/3` for accurate splitting

3. **Merging Logic:**
   - The `merge/3` predicate (lines 13-19) correctly handles:
     - Empty list cases (lines 13-14)
     - Element comparison and ordering (lines 15-19)

4. **Probabilistic Aspect:**
   - The result shows 1.0000 probability, indicating deterministic behavior
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical Prolog reasoning:

1. **Correctness:**
   - Properly implements the merge sort algorithm
   - Handles all specified cases correctly

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty list: Handled by first clause
   - Single-element list: Handled by second clause
   - Even-length lists: Properly split
   - Odd-length lists: Would be properly split (though not tested)

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - Could add type checking for non-list inputs
   - Could optimize tail recursion for very large lists
   - Could add tests for edge cases (duplicate elements, already sorted lists)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | None | Consider adding more test cases |
| 2 | DeepProbLog not used | None | N/A (not required) |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking |

**Word Count:** 398 words

The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical Prolog execution. The merge sort algorithm is properly implemented with appropriate base cases and recursive decomposition. Additional test cases could further verify robustness, but the current implementation shows no defects.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
