# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm. The code aims to provide an interpretable sorting mechanism through recursive comparison and swapping of adjacent elements. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, termination conditions, and proper Problog syntax usage.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:14
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-8), specifically at line 4 where the conditional operator `->` is used. Problog doesn't natively support the standard Prolog conditional operator `->/2` without proper definition.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm structure is logically correct for a bubblesort implementation, with proper recursive calls and base cases.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: The code doesn't contain any probabilistic facts or rules, operating purely in classical logic mode.
3. **DeepProbLog Features**: DeepProbLog features (neural networks, tensors) are not used in this implementation.
4. **Conditional Operator Issue**: The main failure stems from using Prolog's `->/2` operator which isn't directly available in Problog's default environment.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The classical reasoning requirement is partially met - the sorting logic is correct but the implementation isn't compatible with Problog's syntax.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly, but non-list inputs would cause type errors.
3. **Performance**: The recursive implementation could face performance issues with large lists due to Prolog's stack limitations.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported `->/2` operator | Complete failure | Replace with Problog-compatible conditional logic |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical logic | Add probabilistic facts if needed |
| 3 | No type checking | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |

## Recommended Fix
Replace the conditional operator with Problog-compatible logic:

```prolog
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L1),
    (L = L1, 
        append(Acc, L, Sorted)
    ; 
        L \= L1,
        append(Acc, [H|_], NewAcc),
        bubblesort(L1, NewAcc, Sorted)
    ).
```

The modified version uses unification (`=`) and inequality (`\=`) checks instead of the conditional operator, making it compatible with Problog's execution model while maintaining the same logical behavior.
