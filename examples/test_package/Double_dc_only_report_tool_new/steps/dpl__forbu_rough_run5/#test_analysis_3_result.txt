# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm. The code attempts to sort a list using a classic bubble sort approach with accumulator pattern. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, logical structure, and compliance with Problog requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:13
```

The query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` could not be executed due to a syntax error in the conditional statement implementation.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-8), specifically at line 4 where the conditional operator `->` is used incorrectly. Problog doesn't support the standard Prolog conditional construct `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` in the same way.

Problematic code section:
```prolog
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L1),
    (L = L1 ->               % Line 4 - Invalid conditional syntax
        append(Acc, L, Sorted)
    ;
        append(Acc, [H|T], NewAcc),
        bubblesort(L1, NewAcc, Sorted)
    ).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The conditional operator `->` is not properly supported in this Problog context, causing the evaluation to fail.
2. **Logical Structure**: The algorithm's logic appears correct for a bubble sort implementation, but the syntax prevents execution.
3. **Recursive Termination**: The base case (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`) is correctly defined, but the recursive case cannot be reached due to the syntax error.
4. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The code is purely deterministic.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The implementation fails to meet basic functional requirements due to the syntax error.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code doesn't handle:
   - Non-list inputs
   - Empty lists (though the base case is defined)
   - Lists with duplicate elements
3. **Performance**: The recursive structure suggests potential performance issues with large lists, but this cannot be verified due to the syntax error.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration or probabilistic features are used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid conditional syntax (`->`) | Complete failure | Replace with Problog-compatible control structure |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to deterministic sorting | Consider adding probabilistic facts if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for list inputs |

## Recommendations
1. Replace the conditional statement with Problog-compatible control structures
2. Consider adding input validation for list arguments
3. If probabilistic sorting is desired, add relevant probabilistic facts
4. Test with edge cases (empty lists, non-list inputs, duplicates)

The current implementation requires syntax correction before functional evaluation can proceed. The core algorithm logic appears sound, but cannot be verified until the syntax issues are resolved.
