    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:14.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm. The code aims to provide an interpretable sorting mechanism through recursive comparison and swapping of adjacent elements. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, termination conditions, and proper Problog syntax usage.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:14
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-8), specifically at line 4 where the conditional operator `->` is used. Problog doesn't natively support the standard Prolog conditional operator `->/2` without proper definition.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm structure is logically correct for a bubblesort implementation, with proper recursive calls and base cases.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: The code doesn't contain any probabilistic facts or rules, operating purely in classical logic mode.
3. **DeepProbLog Features**: DeepProbLog features (neural networks, tensors) are not used in this implementation.
4. **Conditional Operator Issue**: The main failure stems from using Prolog's `->/2` operator which isn't directly available in Problog's default environment.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The classical reasoning requirement is partially met - the sorting logic is correct but the implementation isn't compatible with Problog's syntax.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly, but non-list inputs would cause type errors.
3. **Performance**: The recursive implementation could face performance issues with large lists due to Prolog's stack limitations.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported `->/2` operator | Complete failure | Replace with Problog-compatible conditional logic |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical logic | Add probabilistic facts if needed |
| 3 | No type checking | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |

## Recommended Fix
Replace the conditional operator with Problog-compatible logic:

```prolog
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L1),
    (L = L1, 
        append(Acc, L, Sorted)
    ; 
        L \= L1,
        append(Acc, [H|_], NewAcc),
        bubblesort(L1, NewAcc, Sorted)
    ).
```

The modified version uses unification (`=`) and inequality (`\=`) checks instead of the conditional operator, making it compatible with Problog's execution model while maintaining the same logical behavior.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
