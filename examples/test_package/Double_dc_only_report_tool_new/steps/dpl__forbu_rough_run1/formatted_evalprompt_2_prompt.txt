</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog bubblesort implementation adapted for ProbLog compatibility. The code aims to provide an interpretable sorting algorithm through the `bubblesort/3` predicate, with a wrapper `forth_sort/2` for direct list sorting. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog functionality and ProbLog compatibility.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'if/3' at 6:5
```
No successful test results were recorded due to this fundamental error preventing execution.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 5-7) where it attempts to use an undefined `if/3` construct. The problematic code section:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    if(Swapped == true,           % Line 6 - Error location
       bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted),
       append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The implementation incorrectly assumes `if/3` is a built-in predicate
   - Standard Prolog uses `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` for conditional branching
   - Recursive termination appears correct in the base cases (lines 3-4)

2. **ProbLog Compatibility**:
   - The code doesn't contain any probabilistic facts or rules
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) are used
   - The error prevents any probabilistic evaluation from occurring

3. **Missing Requirements**:
   - The `if/3` predicate is neither defined nor available in standard ProbLog
   - No expansion predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) are present or needed

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - ❌ Classical reasoning: Not met due to undefined `if/3`
   - ❌ Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
   - ❌ Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input handling not tested (error prevented execution)
   - Empty list case appears correct in base case (line 3)
   - Performance with large lists untested due to fundamental error

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `if/3` predicate | Complete failure of all functionality | Replace with Prolog's `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` construct |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical Prolog functionality | Add probabilistic facts if probabilistic sorting is desired |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors with non-list input | Add type checking for list arguments |

**Recommended Fix**:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped == true ->
       bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ; append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)).
```

The evaluation reveals a fundamental incompatibility with ProbLog due to the undefined `if/3` predicate. The core sorting logic appears correct but cannot execute without this fix. The implementation currently provides no probabilistic functionality and doesn't utilize any DeepProbLog features.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
