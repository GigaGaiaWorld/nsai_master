# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog bubblesort implementation adapted for ProbLog compatibility. The code aims to provide an interpretable sorting algorithm through the `bubblesort/3` predicate, with a wrapper `forth_sort/2` for direct list sorting. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog functionality and ProbLog compatibility.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'if/3' at 6:5
```
No successful test results were recorded due to this fundamental error preventing execution.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 5-7) where it attempts to use an undefined `if/3` construct. The problematic code section:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    if(Swapped == true,           % Line 6 - Error location
       bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted),
       append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The implementation incorrectly assumes `if/3` is a built-in predicate
   - Standard Prolog uses `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` for conditional branching
   - Recursive termination appears correct in the base cases (lines 3-4)

2. **ProbLog Compatibility**:
   - The code doesn't contain any probabilistic facts or rules
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) are used
   - The error prevents any probabilistic evaluation from occurring

3. **Missing Requirements**:
   - The `if/3` predicate is neither defined nor available in standard ProbLog
   - No expansion predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) are present or needed

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - ❌ Classical reasoning: Not met due to undefined `if/3`
   - ❌ Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
   - ❌ Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input handling not tested (error prevented execution)
   - Empty list case appears correct in base case (line 3)
   - Performance with large lists untested due to fundamental error

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `if/3` predicate | Complete failure of all functionality | Replace with Prolog's `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` construct |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical Prolog functionality | Add probabilistic facts if probabilistic sorting is desired |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors with non-list input | Add type checking for list arguments |

**Recommended Fix**:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped == true ->
       bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ; append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)).
```

The evaluation reveals a fundamental incompatibility with ProbLog due to the undefined `if/3` predicate. The core sorting logic appears correct but cannot execute without this fix. The implementation currently provides no probabilistic functionality and doesn't utilize any DeepProbLog features.
