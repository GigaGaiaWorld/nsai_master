 Error evaluating Problog model:

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:22.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Problog Bubblesort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm adapted for ProbLog. The code should correctly sort lists using the classic bubblesort approach while being compatible with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with an error indicating ProbLog could not find clauses for the `->/2` operator. The single test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` did not complete successfully.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-7), specifically at the conditional statement:
```prolog
(Swapped == true ->
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
;
    append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)
)
```
ProbLog does not natively support the standard Prolog `->/2` conditional operator, which caused the evaluation failure.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm logic is correct for standard Prolog but incompatible with ProbLog's syntax
2. **Recursive Termination**: The base cases are properly defined but never reached due to the syntax error
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
4. **DeepProbLog Integration**: DeepProbLog features are not used in this code

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct logic but incompatible syntax)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input handling: Not addressed
   - Empty list handling: Correctly implemented
   - Deep recursion: Potential stack issues with very large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog incompatible conditional operator | Complete failure | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible control structure |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical sorting | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for list input |

**Recommendation**: Rewrite the conditional using ProbLog's `if/3` predicate:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    if(Swapped == true,
       bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted),
       append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)).
```

The current implementation shows correct algorithmic logic but fails due to ProbLog syntax incompatibility. With the suggested modification, it should work as intended in the ProbLog environment.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
