# Problog Bubblesort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm adapted for ProbLog. The code should correctly sort lists using the classic bubblesort approach while being compatible with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with an error indicating ProbLog could not find clauses for the `->/2` operator. The single test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` did not complete successfully.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-7), specifically at the conditional statement:
```prolog
(Swapped == true ->
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
;
    append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)
)
```
ProbLog does not natively support the standard Prolog `->/2` conditional operator, which caused the evaluation failure.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm logic is correct for standard Prolog but incompatible with ProbLog's syntax
2. **Recursive Termination**: The base cases are properly defined but never reached due to the syntax error
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
4. **DeepProbLog Integration**: DeepProbLog features are not used in this code

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct logic but incompatible syntax)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input handling: Not addressed
   - Empty list handling: Correctly implemented
   - Deep recursion: Potential stack issues with very large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog incompatible conditional operator | Complete failure | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible control structure |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical sorting | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for list input |

**Recommendation**: Rewrite the conditional using ProbLog's `if/3` predicate:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    if(Swapped == true,
       bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted),
       append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)).
```

The current implementation shows correct algorithmic logic but fails due to ProbLog syntax incompatibility. With the suggested modification, it should work as intended in the ProbLog environment.
