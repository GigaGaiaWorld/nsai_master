# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog bubblesort implementation adapted for ProbLog. The code should correctly sort lists using the classic bubblesort algorithm while being compatible with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, error handling, and ProbLog compatibility.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:22
```

The single test query `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))` did not complete successfully. No probability results were generated due to the compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate at line 4 (character position 22), specifically in this conditional statement:
```prolog
(Swapped == true ->
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
;   append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)
)
```

The issue stems from ProbLog's inability to recognize the standard Prolog `->/2` conditional operator. ProbLog requires different syntax for conditional statements compared to standard Prolog.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Incompatibility**: ProbLog doesn't support Prolog's `->/2` operator directly. The conditional logic needs to be restructured using ProbLog-compatible constructs.
2. **Logical Correctness**: The core sorting logic appears correct for standard Prolog, but fails in ProbLog due to syntax differences.
3. **Recursive Termination**: The base cases (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`, `bubble_pass([X], [X], false)`, `bubble_pass([], [], false)`) are properly defined and should terminate correctly once syntax issues are resolved.
4. **Probabilistic Features**: No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (DeepProbLog) are used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (logic is correct but syntax incompatible)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty list input: Handled correctly in the base case
   - Single-element list: Handled correctly
   - Non-list input: Not properly type-checked
   - Performance: Standard bubblesort O(nÂ²) complexity, but no protection against stack overflow for very large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog incompatible conditional syntax | Complete failure | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible control structures |
| 2 | No type checking for input | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for list type |
| 3 | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic sorting | Consider adding probabilistic elements if required |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% ProbLog-compatible bubblesort implementation
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped = true,
     bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
     Swapped = false,
     append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)
    ).
```

The main change replaces the `->/2` operator with a ProbLog-compatible conjunction/disjunction pattern. This maintains the same logical flow while being syntactically correct in ProbLog.
