# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant chooses between three doors with one hiding a prize. The implementation models the host's behavior and calculates probabilities for winning by either keeping the initial choice or switching doors.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform 1/3 probability distribution for the prize location
2. Fixed initial selection of door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
- The host's door-opening behavior (rules at lines 4-14)
- Prize probability distribution (line 1)
- Win condition calculations (lines 15-20)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
1. `P(Â¬prize(X)) = 1 - P(prize(X))` is implicitly handled
2. The host's behavior properly models conditional probabilities:
   - When two empty doors exist, one is randomly opened (50/50)
   - When only one empty door exists, it's opened with certainty
3. The win probabilities correctly account for the game's conditional structure:
   - `win_keep` matches the initial 1/3 chance
   - `win_switch` properly calculates the 2/3 advantage

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct logical structure for game rules
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper handling of probability distributions
- **Edge cases**: Handles all door selection scenarios (1 or 2 empty doors)

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct | 

The code (hash E2FA63E7 and B4161B21) correctly implements the Monty Hall problem with proper probabilistic reasoning and handles all edge cases. The test results confirm the expected probabilities for both keeping and switching choices, demonstrating a correct understanding of the problem's conditional probability structure.
