# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system models actuator selection, wind effects, and flap position control with probabilistic outcomes. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test queries executed successfully with the following probability results:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
- goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
- goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
- goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
- goal_reached(5) = 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results show decreasing probabilities for reaching the goal over time and increasing then stabilizing probabilities for overrun exceptions, which aligns with expected system behavior.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- `flap_position/2` correctly handles legal positions (Hash: B79F5C58)
- `overrun_exception/1` properly detects illegal positions (Hash: E185A34B)
- `goal_reached/1` accurately checks goal achievement (Hash: 779B4ADF)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The recursive time steps properly terminate at Time=5 via the `at/1` predicate
- All position calculations consider actuator strength and wind effects correctly
- Negation in `\+ goal(Old)` properly handles the continuation condition

**Probabilistic Compliance:**
- Actuator selection probabilities sum to 1 (0.5::a; 0.5::b)
- Wind effect distributions properly condition on wind strength
- Probability calculations follow P(¬A)=1−P(A) for negative conditions

**DeepProbLog Feature:** DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for position control logic
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly models actuator selection and wind effects
- Neural integration: Not required for this implementation

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Illegal flap positions trigger overrun exceptions
- Wind effects properly scale with strength (weak vs. strong)
- Initial position (6) and goal (4) are properly defined

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

**Code Quality Observations:**
1. The implementation could benefit from additional comments explaining the probability distributions
2. The wind effect probabilities could be parameterized for easier modification
3. Adding a maximum time limit would prevent potential infinite recursion in extended scenarios

**Word Count:** 423 words

The implementation correctly models the aircraft flap control system with proper probabilistic handling of actuator selection and environmental effects. All functional requirements are met without any detected errors in the test cases.
