# Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against functional requirements and identify any potential issues in classical Prolog reasoning.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list with full certainty (probability 1.0).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. Element comparison during merging

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The recursion terminates properly with base cases (lines 1-2)
   - The splitting (lines 9-12) and merging (lines 13-19) predicates are correctly implemented
   - The comparison operation in merge (lines 16-19) properly handles element ordering

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The result shows probability 1.0, indicating deterministic behavior
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully met (correct sorting implementation)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure deterministic implementation)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty list input (handled by line 1)
2. Single-element list (handled by line 2)
3. Even- and odd-length lists (handled by split predicate)
4. Already sorted input (handled by merge predicate)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Could add type checking for non-list inputs
2. Could optimize tail recursion for very large lists
3. Could add probabilistic version with possible comparison errors
