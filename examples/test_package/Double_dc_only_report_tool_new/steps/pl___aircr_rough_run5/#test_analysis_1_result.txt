# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under varying wind conditions and actuator choices, with probabilistic outcomes for goal achievement and overrun exceptions.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probabilities for each query:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1): 0.2625
- goal_reached(2): 0.1873
- goal_reached(3): 0.1269
- goal_reached(4): 0.0841
- goal_reached(5): 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1): 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2): 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3): 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4): 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5): 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results show consistent probability distributions that properly account for all possible combinations of actuator choices and wind effects.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- The recursive position calculation (lines 20-25)
- Wind effect probabilities (lines 8-10)
- Actuator selection probabilities (line 6)
- Goal checking and overrun detection (lines 13-18)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis

### Classical ProbLog Aspects:
- The recursive position calculation correctly terminates when either the goal is reached or the maximum time step (5) is exceeded
- Logical predicates properly handle all edge cases (legal positions, wind effects)

### Probabilistic Aspects:
- Actuator selection probabilities sum to 1 (0.5::a + 0.5::b)
- Wind effect distributions properly conditional on wind strength
- Probability calculations comply with P(¬A)=1−P(A) for negative cases

### DeepProbLog:
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis

### Requirements Met:
- **Classical reasoning**: Fully implemented for position tracking
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Correctly models actuator choices and wind effects
- **Neural network integration**: Not required/implemented

### Edge Cases Handled:
- Legal position bounds (0-10) enforced
- Wind effects properly constrained to discrete values
- Time steps limited to 5 via `at(5)`

### Potential Improvements:
1. Add explicit bounds checking for wind effect accumulation
2. Consider modeling actuator fatigue over time
3. Add visualization of probability distributions

## 6. Error Summary

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic modeling of a dynamic system with multiple interacting factors. The probability distributions show expected behavior where goal achievement becomes less likely over time as overrun risks increase, reflecting the system's realistic uncertainty.
