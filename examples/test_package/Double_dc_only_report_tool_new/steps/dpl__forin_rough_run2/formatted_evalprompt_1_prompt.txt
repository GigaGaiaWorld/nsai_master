    raise UnexpectedCharacter(s, pos)
problog.parser.UnexpectedCharacter: Unexpected character '.' at 1:67.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Insertion Sort Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The code was tested with a query to sort the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, error analysis, and compliance with Prolog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` resulted in an error rather than successful execution. The error message indicates a parsing issue with an unexpected character '.' at position 1:67.

**Failed Query:**
```
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
**Actual Result:**
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
Unexpected character '.' at 1:67
```
**Expected Result:**
```
X = [1,2,3,5,7,12]
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs during parsing before the actual Prolog code execution begins. The issue stems from:
1. An extraneous period character (.) at the end of the code block (line 1, column 67)
2. The code appears to be standard Prolog but is being evaluated in a ProbLog environment

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The unexpected period after the code block is causing a parsing failure in the ProbLog environment
2. **Environment Mismatch**: The code is written in standard Prolog but is being evaluated in ProbLog, which has stricter syntax requirements
3. **Logical Correctness**: The actual sorting algorithm appears logically correct for standard Prolog:
   - Base case and recursive cases are properly defined
   - Insertion logic correctly handles both less-than and greater-than cases
   - Recursive termination is guaranteed as the list shrinks with each recursion

**DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**: The implementation doesn't utilize any neural network integration or probabilistic features.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (algorithm is correct but environment mismatch prevents execution)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input handling not implemented
   - Empty list case is properly handled
   - Duplicate elements would be handled correctly by the current logic
   - Performance with large lists not optimized (O(n²) complexity inherent to insertion sort)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Extraneous period character | Prevents code execution | Remove the stray period after code block |
| 2 | ProbLog vs Prolog environment mismatch | Causes parsing error | Either use standard Prolog environment or adapt syntax for ProbLog |
| 3 | Missing test cases | Limited verification | Add tests for edge cases (empty list, duplicates, non-list input) |

**Word Count**: 398 words

The core sorting algorithm appears correct for standard Prolog, but the execution environment and syntax issues need to be resolved for proper evaluation. Once the parsing error is fixed, the implementation should correctly perform insertion sort as required.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
