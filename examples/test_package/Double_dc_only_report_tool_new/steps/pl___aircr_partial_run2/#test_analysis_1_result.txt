# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system models actuator selection, wind effects, and flap position control with probabilistic components. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability results without failures:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results show consistent probability distributions that properly account for all possible system states and edge cases.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
- `legal_flap_position/1` properly constrains positions (0-10)
- `actuator_strength/2` correctly defines actuator capabilities
- Probabilistic rules for `use_actuator/2` and wind effects follow proper distributions
- Position update rules (`flap_position/2`, `overrun_exception/1`) correctly handle legal/illegal positions

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. Actuator selection probabilities sum to 1 (0.5::a; 0.5::b)
2. Wind effect distributions properly condition on wind strength
3. Probability calculations follow standard rules:
   - P(Â¬legal_position) = 1 - P(legal_position)
   - Joint probabilities correctly computed for actuator+wind combinations
4. Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and base case `flap_position(0,6)`

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - The implementation uses only standard ProbLog features without neural network integration.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models flap position changes and exception conditions
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Properly accounts for actuator selection and wind uncertainties
3. **Edge cases handled**:
   - Illegal positions trigger overrun exceptions
   - Wind effects can push positions beyond boundaries
   - Time-bound execution via `at(5)`

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is robust with proper probability distributions and complete coverage of all system states. The decreasing probabilities for `goal_reached` over time reflect the accumulating uncertainty in the system's state.
