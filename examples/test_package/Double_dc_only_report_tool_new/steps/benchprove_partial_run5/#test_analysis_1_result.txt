# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes predicates for implication, opposition, expansion, list operations, and basic ancestor relationships. The purpose is to verify correctness in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
All 5 test queries returned success (probability 1.0000):
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 1.0000
2. `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 1.0000
3. `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 1.0000
4. `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` = 1.0000
5. `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` = 1.0000

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures occurred. All expansion predicates were verified:
- `implies/2` correctly implements P⇒Q as ¬P∨Q (lines 12-14)
- `opposite/1` correctly implements ¬P (lines 16-18)
- `expand/2` correctly handles arithmetic expansion (lines 29-31)
- `includes/2` correctly checks list membership (lines 20-21)
- `extend/3` correctly prepends elements (lines 23-25)

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical ProbLog Analysis:
- Logical correctness confirmed for all predicates
- Recursive predicates (`member/2`, `ancestor/2`) have proper base cases and termination
- Negation handling (`\+ prove(P)`) follows classical negation-as-failure

### Probabilistic Analysis:
- Implication correctly follows P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)
- Opposite correctly follows P(¬A) = 1-P(A)
- No probabilistic facts were used (only deterministic reasoning)
- **DeepProbLog feature not used**

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correct but only deterministic cases tested
- Neural network integration: Not applicable (not used)

### Edge Cases Considered:
- Undefined `expand/2` would fail (none in tests)
- Non-list input to list operations would fail (not tested)
- Deep recursion not tested (ancestor depth only 2)
- Type safety not enforced (dynamic typing used)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Consider adding probabilistic fact tests |
| 2 | None | None | Add edge case tests for list operations |
| 3 | None | None | Consider adding DeepProbLog integration |

**Word count:** 398 words

The code demonstrates correct implementation of all specified requirements in classical ProbLog context. For production use, additional testing with probabilistic facts and edge cases would be recommended.
