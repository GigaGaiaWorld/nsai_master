# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of stack operations including sorting, pushing, popping, duplicating, swapping, and rotating elements. The primary purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against test queries and analyze any failures.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
```

**All tests failed (probability 0.0000 for all queries)**. The implementation only contains the `sort` operation but is being tested for other unimplemented operations.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Queries**:
   - `push/3`, `pop/3`, `dup/3`, `swap/3`, `over/3`, `rot/3` - All failed as these operations are not implemented
2. **Error Location**:
   - Missing implementations for all non-sort operations (entire codebase)
   - Only `stack_op(sort(N),...)` is defined (lines 1-10)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Analysis**:
   - The implemented `sort` operation appears logically correct with proper recursive termination
   - Helper predicates (`get_top_n`, `insertion_sort`, etc.) are correctly implemented
2. **ProbLog Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the implementation
   - All queries return 0.0000 probability as they don't match any defined rules
3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Only the sorting operation is implemented (partial fulfillment)
   - Classical reasoning works for the implemented sort operation
   - Probabilistic reasoning and neural integration not utilized
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling for non-list inputs
   - No protection against stack underflow
   - No validation for N > stack length in sort operation
   - Deep recursion could be problematic for very large stacks

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing push operation | Test failure | Implement push/3 predicate |
| 2 | Missing pop operation | Test failure | Implement pop/3 predicate |
| 3 | Missing dup operation | Test failure | Implement dup/3 predicate |
| 4 | Missing swap operation | Test failure | Implement swap/3 predicate |
| 5 | Missing over operation | Test failure | Implement over/3 predicate |
| 6 | Missing rot operation | Test failure | Implement rot/3 predicate |
| 7 | No probabilistic elements | Limited functionality | Consider adding probabilistic rules |
| 8 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type/range checking |

**Word count**: 423 words

The implementation requires significant expansion to meet the stated requirements of "implementing a series of stack operations." The current version only handles sorting of stack elements while the test cases expect a complete stack operation set. The core sorting functionality appears correct, but the missing operations all need to be implemented to pass the test cases.
