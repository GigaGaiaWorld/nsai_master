# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that includes move definitions, win/lose/draw rules, game result calculation, and winner determination. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test case coverage, and identify any implementation errors.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed to execute due to a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W))`
   - **Error Location**: Line 41, Column 77
   - **Problem**: Incomplete predicate definition before the query
   - **Affected Code Block**:
     ```prolog
     determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :-
     
     <Langda>
     <Code_Block>determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
     ```
   - **Root Cause**: The predicate is incorrectly split into two parts with an incomplete first definition

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined with proper termination conditions
   - The move and beats facts are properly declared
   - The result calculation rules are logically correct

2. **ProbLog Specifics**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) are used
   - The error is purely syntactic, not related to probabilistic reasoning

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (not implemented)
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Uneven move lists would cause failure
   - Invalid moves would not be caught
   - Deep recursion performance is acceptable for normal game lengths

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition before query | Critical failure | Remove the partial definition before the complete one |
| 2 | No error handling for invalid moves | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |
| 3 | No handling for uneven move lists | Potential failure | Add length check |

## Corrective Actions
1. Remove the partial `determine_winner` definition before the complete version
2. The corrected code should appear as:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1;
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2;
     Winner = draw).
```
3. After this correction, the test query should execute properly and return `Winner = player2` for the given input.

The core game logic is sound, but the implementation error prevents proper execution. Once the syntax error is corrected, the implementation should function as intended for valid inputs.
