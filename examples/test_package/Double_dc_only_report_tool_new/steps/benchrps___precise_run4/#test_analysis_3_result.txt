# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The code should correctly calculate round results and determine the overall winner.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate (line 41) where the if-then-else construct (`->/2`) is not properly formatted in ProbLog syntax. The problematic code block:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; Winner = draw).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: ProbLog requires proper formatting of conditional statements. The if-then-else construct needs to be properly parenthesized.
2. **Logical Correctness**: The core game logic (move/1, beats/2, result/3) is correctly defined.
3. **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates play/3 and compute_score/2 have proper base cases.
4. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not used
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Unequal move list lengths not checked
   - Invalid moves not validated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect if-then-else syntax | Predicate fails to execute | Reformulate conditional using proper ProbLog syntax |
| 2 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add move validation checks |
| 3 | No length checking | Undefined behavior on unequal lists | Verify list lengths match |

## Corrected Code
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (   Score > 0 -> Winner = player1
    ;   Score < 0 -> Winner = player2
    ;   Winner = draw
    ).
```

The evaluation reveals a syntax error in the conditional statement that prevents proper execution. The core game logic is otherwise correctly implemented, but would benefit from additional input validation and edge case handling.
