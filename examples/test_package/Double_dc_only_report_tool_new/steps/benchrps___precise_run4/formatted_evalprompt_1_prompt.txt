<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that includes move definitions, win/lose/draw rules, game result calculation, and winner determination. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test case coverage, and identify any implementation errors.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed to execute due to a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W))`
   - **Error Location**: Line 41, Column 77
   - **Problem**: Incomplete predicate definition before the query
   - **Affected Code Block**:
     ```prolog
     determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :-
     
     <Langda>
     <Code_Block>determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
     ```
   - **Root Cause**: The predicate is incorrectly split into two parts with an incomplete first definition

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined with proper termination conditions
   - The move and beats facts are properly declared
   - The result calculation rules are logically correct

2. **ProbLog Specifics**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) are used
   - The error is purely syntactic, not related to probabilistic reasoning

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (not implemented)
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Uneven move lists would cause failure
   - Invalid moves would not be caught
   - Deep recursion performance is acceptable for normal game lengths

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition before query | Critical failure | Remove the partial definition before the complete one |
| 2 | No error handling for invalid moves | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |
| 3 | No handling for uneven move lists | Potential failure | Add length check |

## Corrective Actions
1. Remove the partial `determine_winner` definition before the complete version
2. The corrected code should appear as:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1;
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2;
     Winner = draw).
```
3. After this correction, the test query should execute properly and return `Winner = player2` for the given input.

The core game logic is sound, but the implementation error prevents proper execution. Once the syntax error is corrected, the implementation should function as intended for valid inputs.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
