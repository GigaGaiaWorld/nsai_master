### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic rules.
- Logical consistency.
- Compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails to execute due to a parsing error:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    rf = self.fold(
         ^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1101, in fold
    raise ParseError(
problog.parser.ParseError: Operator priority clash at 8:29.
```
- **Failed Queries**: All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) fail due to the parsing error.
- **Expected Results**: Probabilistic outcomes for each query (e.g., `win_keep` should return ~1/3 probability).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location**: Line 8, Column 29.
- **Root Cause**: The parser encounters an operator priority clash, likely due to incorrect syntax in the probabilistic rules or missing delimiters.
- **Affected Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
  ```
  The issue arises from improper handling of probabilistic disjunction.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The rules for `open_door/1` and `open_door/2` are logically sound but syntactically incorrect.
  - Recursive termination is ensured via `member/2`.
- **Probabilistic Rules**:
  - The negation `\+ prize(A)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.
  - The disjunction `open_door(A) ; open_door(B)` is intended to model uniform choice but is malformed.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logical rules are correct but syntax is flawed).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to parsing error.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `member(X, 1)` would fail).
  - Deep recursion is avoided due to finite lists.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Operator priority clash          | Code fails to parse             | Fix syntax for probabilistic disjunction.   |
| 2      | Missing delimiter in rule        | Rules are not properly defined  | Add a period (`.`) after the rule.          |
| 3      | Unhandled non-list inputs        | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for `member/2`.        |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Syntax Fix**:
   ```prolog
   0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
       select_door(Selected),
       member(A, [1,2,3]),
       member(B, [1,2,3]),
       A \= Selected, B \= Selected,
       A \= B, \+ prize(A), \+ prize(B).
   ```
2. **Input Validation**:
   ```prolog
   member(X, L) :- is_list(L), member_(X, L).
   member_(X, [X|_]).
   member_(X, [_|T]) :- member_(X, T).
   ```

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The implementation requires syntax fixes and input validation to meet functional requirements.
