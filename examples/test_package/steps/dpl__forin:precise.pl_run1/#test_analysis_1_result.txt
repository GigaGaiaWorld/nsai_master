### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules, and ensure it meets functional requirements (classical and probabilistic reasoning). The evaluation also checks for edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The query successfully returns the sorted list with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` function as expected.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Recursively sorts the tail list and inserts the head element.  
- `insert_element/3`: Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

**Code Line Numbers:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Lines 1–4  
- `insert_element/3`: Lines 5–9  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation adheres to the insertion sort algorithm. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved in this query. The code behaves deterministically.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...`, or related calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly implements insertion sort.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules used).  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is proportional to the input list length, which is acceptable for typical use cases but may cause stack overflow for very large lists.  

**Suggestions:**  
- Add input validation for non-list inputs.  
- Consider iterative implementations for large lists to avoid stack overflow.

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling     | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation                |
| 2      | Deep recursion              | Stack overflow for large lists   | Use iterative approach for scalability |

**Final Verdict:**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. Enhancements are suggested for broader applicability.
