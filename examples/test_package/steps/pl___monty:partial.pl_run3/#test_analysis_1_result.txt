### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules adhere to the problem's requirements:
- **`open_door/1` Rules:**
  - Correctly handles cases where both unselected doors are empty (random selection).
  - Correctly handles cases where one unselected door has a prize (selects the empty door).
- **`win_keep` and `win_switch`:**
  - Accurately reflect the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching doors.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- Logical correctness is ensured:
  - Recursive predicates (e.g., `member/2`) terminate correctly.
  - No infinite loops or undefined cases.
- Negations (`\+`) are used appropriately to exclude invalid doors.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- Probabilistic facts (`1/3::prize/1`) are correctly defined.
- The host's behavior (`open_door/1`) complies with probabilistic rules:
  - When both unselected doors are empty, the host chooses randomly (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).
  - When one unselected door has a prize, the host opens the empty door deterministically.

**DeepProbLog Features:**
- Not used in this implementation. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The logic correctly models the Monty Hall problem.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. Probabilities align with theoretical expectations.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., doors 1, 2, or 3). No handling for invalid inputs.
- **Performance:** Recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not a concern.
- **List Handling:** The `member/2` predicate is robust for list inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's rules. No errors were found.
