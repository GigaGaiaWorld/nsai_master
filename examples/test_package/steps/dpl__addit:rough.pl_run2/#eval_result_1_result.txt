  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. Edge cases (non-list inputs, unrecognized image IDs, deep recursion) are not handled but were not part of the original requirements.",
  "SuggestedFix": "None needed for current requirements. For robustness, consider adding: 1. Input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` checks), 2. Error handling for invalid image IDs, 3. Iterative implementation for long lists.",
