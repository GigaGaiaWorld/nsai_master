### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Population Density Query**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within a 5% margin). The code defines a `density/2` predicate to calculate the density and a `query_pop/1` predicate to find matching pairs. The evaluation verifies the correctness of the implementation and its adherence to probabilistic and classical Prolog rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `query_pop([china, 2.440828402366864, france, 2.464788732394366]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([indonesia, 2.23859649122807, pakistan, 2.192926045016077]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([pakistan, 2.192926045016077, indonesia, 2.23859649122807]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([mexico, 0.760471204188482, ethiopia, 0.777142857142857]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([italy, 4.775862068965517, philippines, 4.611111111111111]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([france, 2.464788732394366, china, 2.440828402366864]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([philippines, 4.611111111111111, italy, 4.775862068965517]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 0.777142857142857, mexico, 0.760471204188482]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the `query_pop/1` predicate correctly identifies pairs of countries with population densities differing by no more than 5%.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The `density/2` and `query_pop/1` predicates are correctly implemented, and the results align with the expected behavior.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density using the formula `Pop / Area`. The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the densities of two distinct countries are compared and that the difference is within the 5% threshold.
- **Recursive Termination:** The code does not involve recursion, so termination is not a concern.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic computations (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are involved.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** The code meets the classical reasoning requirements by correctly querying the database and comparing population densities.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic features.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.
- **Non-List Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list, but no edge cases for invalid inputs were tested.
- **Performance:** The code is efficient for the given dataset, but scalability for larger datasets was not evaluated.

|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 450

**Final Remarks:** The code is functionally correct and meets the specified requirements. No issues were identified during the evaluation. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation and testing with larger datasets.
