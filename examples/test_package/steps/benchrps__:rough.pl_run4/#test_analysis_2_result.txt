### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a predicate to determine the winner based on a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because they have two wins (paper beats rock) and one loss (scissor loses to rock), resulting in a net score of `-1` (player2 wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `play/3`: Correctly evaluates the outcome of each move.  
  - `compute_score/2`: Accurately calculates the net score.  
  - `determine_winner/3`: Properly determines the winner based on the computed score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `play/3` and `compute_score/2` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the base case `play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`.  
  - **Edge Cases**: Handles all possible move combinations (win, lose, draw) and empty lists.  

- **ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game rules and determines the winner.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Invalid inputs are not handled.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance is efficient for typical game lengths but may face stack issues with very long move sequences.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | No input validation      | May fail on invalid moves  | Add input validation predicates.   |
| 2      | No probabilistic facts   | Limited to classical logic | Extend for probabilistic scenarios.|
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features  | No neural integration      | Consider adding `nn/3` if needed.  |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The code is functionally correct for classical reasoning but could be enhanced for robustness and extended for probabilistic or neural network integration.
