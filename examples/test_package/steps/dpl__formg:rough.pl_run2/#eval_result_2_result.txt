  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core merge sort logic. Edge cases (non-list inputs, deep recursion) are not handled but were not part of the original requirements.",
  "SuggestedFix": "None needed for the current requirements. For robustness, consider adding input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` checks) and tail recursion optimization.",
