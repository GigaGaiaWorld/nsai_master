### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog (Hash: 418D2062)**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, with the goal of sorting a list of integers. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog's classical reasoning principles. The test case provided checks the functionality of the `merge_sort/2` predicate.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:**  
  The test passed successfully, producing the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` are correctly implemented and function as intended.  
- No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this code, as it is purely classical Prolog.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly implements the divide-and-conquer strategy of merge sort. The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are correctly handled, and the recursive splitting and merging are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates because the `split/3` predicate ensures that the input list is divided into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

##### **ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  The implementation meets the requirements for classical Prolog reasoning. The algorithm is correct and efficiently sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  Not applicable, as the code does not involve probabilistic logic.  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Non-list Input:**  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  
- **Performance:**  
  The recursive implementation may face performance issues with very large lists due to stack limits in some Prolog environments.  
- **Undefined Predicates:**  
  No undefined predicates are used in this implementation.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow        | Optimize for tail recursion.        |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. The code does not utilize ProbLog or DeepProbLog features, making it purely classical Prolog.
