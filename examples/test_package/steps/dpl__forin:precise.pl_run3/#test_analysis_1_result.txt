### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic rules, and ensure it meets the specified functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query and result:  
- **Query:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
- **Result:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability of correctness is 1.0000, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are correctly implemented, and the recursive logic adheres to the requirements.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Recursively sorts the tail list and inserts the head element.  
- `insert_element/3`: Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation correctly follows the insertion sort algorithm. The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) ensures termination for empty lists, and the recursive case sorts the tail before inserting the head.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as the list is progressively reduced to the empty list.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or uncertainties are involved in this query.  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:** Since no probabilistic facts or negations are used, the rules `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` and `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` are not applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Conclusion:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog recursion.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case, as the query is deterministic.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** For very large lists, the recursive implementation may face performance issues due to stack limits.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used in this code.

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling     | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2      | Deep recursion performance  | Stack overflow for large lists  | Consider iterative or tail-recursive optimization. |

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog logic. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Addressing the identified edge cases would improve its reliability.
