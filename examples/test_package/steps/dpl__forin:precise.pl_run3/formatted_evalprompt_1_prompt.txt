</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic rules, and ensure it meets the specified functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query and result:  
- **Query:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
- **Result:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability of correctness is 1.0000, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are correctly implemented, and the recursive logic adheres to the requirements.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Recursively sorts the tail list and inserts the head element.  
- `insert_element/3`: Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation correctly follows the insertion sort algorithm. The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) ensures termination for empty lists, and the recursive case sorts the tail before inserting the head.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as the list is progressively reduced to the empty list.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or uncertainties are involved in this query.  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:** Since no probabilistic facts or negations are used, the rules `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` and `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` are not applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Conclusion:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog recursion.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case, as the query is deterministic.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** For very large lists, the recursive implementation may face performance issues due to stack limits.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used in this code.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling     | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2      | Deep recursion performance  | Stack overflow for large lists  | Consider iterative or tail-recursive optimization. |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog logic. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Addressing the identified edge cases would improve its reliability.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
