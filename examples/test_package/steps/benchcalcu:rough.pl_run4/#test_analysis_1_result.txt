### Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digits for variables `A, B, C, D, E` such that the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` holds. The code uses predicates like `digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, and `sumdigit/5` to enforce constraints and simulate column-wise addition. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`, each with a probability of `1.0000`. Here are the results:
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the constraints defined in the code, and no discrepancies were found.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. However, the following predicates were verified for correctness:
- `digit/1`: Correctly defines digits 0–9.
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures the first digit of multi-digit numbers is not 0.
- `all_different/1`: Enforces uniqueness of digits in the solution.
- `sumdigit/5`: Simulates column-wise addition with carry.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - The logical correctness of the predicates is confirmed. For example, `sumdigit/5` correctly handles carry propagation, and `all_different/1` ensures no digit repeats.
  - Recursive termination is guaranteed in `all_different/1` and `member/2` due to the finite list length.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used, as reported: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle using classical Prolog constraints.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases such as multi-digit numbers not starting with 0 (`leftdigit/1`).
  - The `all_different/1` predicate ensures no invalid repetitions.
  - No undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are present.

**Final Remarks:** The implementation is robust and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified during testing or analysis.
