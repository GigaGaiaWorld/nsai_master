### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of facts (`digit/2`) representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0â€“9). It also includes a rule (`addition/3`) to perform addition based on these digits. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query and result:  
- **Query:** `query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).`  
- **Result:** `addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- The query correctly computes the sum of the digits corresponding to `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6), yielding 11 with a probability of 1.0000.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. All predicates and rules function as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The `digit/2` facts are correctly defined, mapping each image to its corresponding digit.  
- The `addition/3` rule is logically sound:  
  ```prolog
  addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A + B.
  ```  
  It retrieves the digits associated with `X` and `Y`, computes their sum, and binds it to `Z`.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.7::digit(img_1,1).`). Thus, no probabilistic computations (e.g., negations or implications) are involved.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly performs addition based on the defined facts and rules.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as no probabilistic facts or rules are used.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**  
1. **Undefined Inputs:** If an image not listed in `digit/2` is queried, the rule will fail silently.  
   - **Suggestion:** Add a default case or validation to handle undefined inputs.  
2. **Non-Integer Results:** The `addition/3` rule assumes integer inputs and outputs. Non-integer inputs would cause errors.  
   - **Suggestion:** Add type-checking or error handling.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined inputs            | Silent failure                  | Add validation or default cases.            |
| 2      | Non-integer inputs/outputs  | Runtime errors                  | Implement type-checking or error handling.  |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is functionally correct for the given requirements and passes all tests. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Enhancements for input validation and error handling are recommended.
