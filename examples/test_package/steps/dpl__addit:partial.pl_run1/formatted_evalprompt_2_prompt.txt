</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Addition**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a simple addition operation between digits represented as images (`img_1` to `img_0`). The goal is to verify the correctness of the `addition/3` predicate and ensure it meets the specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning, as no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(addition(img_5, img_6, Z))`.  
- **Result**:  
  - `addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000`.  

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The query correctly returns the sum of the digits represented by `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6), which is 11. The probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**: All tests passed.  
- **Expansion Predicates**: Not applicable, as no expansion predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) are used in the code.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario**:  
  - The `addition/3` predicate is logically correct. It retrieves the numeric values of `X` and `Y` using `digit/2` and computes their sum.  
  - No recursion is involved, so termination is guaranteed.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. All facts (`digit/2`) are deterministic.  
  - No probabilistic implications or negations are present.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The `addition/3` predicate performs deterministic addition.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code does not handle inputs outside `img_0` to `img_9`. For example, `addition(img_10, img_5, Z)` would fail.  
  - **Non-Image Inputs**: The code assumes inputs are of the form `img_N`. Non-conforming inputs (e.g., `addition(5, 6, Z)`) would fail.  
  - **Performance**: Not relevant here due to the simplicity of the code.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No handling of invalid inputs (`img_10`, etc.) | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation or error handling. |
| 2      | No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features used | Limited functionality | Extend with probabilistic rules or neural network integration if needed. |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Notes**: The code is correct for the given requirements but lacks robustness for edge cases and advanced features. Enhancements could include input validation and optional probabilistic extensions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
