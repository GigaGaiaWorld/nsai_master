### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Addition**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a simple addition operation between digits represented as images (`img_1` to `img_0`). The goal is to verify the correctness of the `addition/3` predicate and ensure it meets the specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning, as no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(addition(img_5, img_6, Z))`.  
- **Result**:  
  - `addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000`.  

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The query correctly returns the sum of the digits represented by `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6), which is 11. The probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic correctness.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**: All tests passed.  
- **Expansion Predicates**: Not applicable, as no expansion predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) are used in the code.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario**:  
  - The `addition/3` predicate is logically correct. It retrieves the numeric values of `X` and `Y` using `digit/2` and computes their sum.  
  - No recursion is involved, so termination is guaranteed.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. All facts (`digit/2`) are deterministic.  
  - No probabilistic implications or negations are present.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The `addition/3` predicate performs deterministic addition.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code does not handle inputs outside `img_0` to `img_9`. For example, `addition(img_10, img_5, Z)` would fail.  
  - **Non-Image Inputs**: The code assumes inputs are of the form `img_N`. Non-conforming inputs (e.g., `addition(5, 6, Z)`) would fail.  
  - **Performance**: Not relevant here due to the simplicity of the code.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No handling of invalid inputs (`img_10`, etc.) | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation or error handling. |
| 2      | No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features used | Limited functionality | Extend with probabilistic rules or neural network integration if needed. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Notes**: The code is correct for the given requirements but lacks robustness for edge cases and advanced features. Enhancements could include input validation and optional probabilistic extensions.
