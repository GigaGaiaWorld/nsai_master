### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code**  

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss experiment where a biased coin (with a probability of 0.8 for heads) is tossed multiple times. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) and accumulate the results (`S`) as the counter (`CNT`) decrements to 0. The test results show the probabilities of achieving different success counts (`total(S)`).  

This report evaluates the correctness of the code, verifies the test results, and ensures compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `total(4) = 0.4096`  
- `total(3) = 0.4096`  
- `total(2) = 0.1536`  
- `total(1) = 0.0256`  
- `total(0) = 0.0016`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities are consistent with the binomial distribution for 4 trials with success probability 0.8.  
- For example:  
  - `total(4)`: All 4 coins are heads: \(0.8^4 = 0.4096\).  
  - `total(0)`: All 4 coins are tails: \(0.2^4 = 0.0016\).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The code correctly implements the requirements:  
- The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` handles both success (`coin(CNT)`) and failure (`\+ coin(CNT)`) cases.  
- The counter (`CNT`) decrements correctly, and the success count (`SC`) increments only when a coin toss is successful.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursion terminates when `CNT` reaches 0, and the base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` ensures the final result is accumulated.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The predicate `coins_r/3` is well-defined and terminates as `CNT` strictly decreases.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probability of `coin(C)` is correctly set to 0.8, and its negation (`\+ coin(C)`) follows \(P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.2\).  
- The accumulation of probabilities in `total(S)` adheres to the binomial distribution formula.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly counts successes and terminates.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with the binomial distribution.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the code.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to `CNT` (4 in this case), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is logically and probabilistically correct, meeting all specified requirements. No edge cases or failures were identified. The absence of DeepProbLog features is noted, but it is not required for this task.  

**Code Block for Reference:**  
```prolog
PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(CNT),
    SC1 is SC + 1,
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC1,S,CNT1).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    \+ coin(CNT),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC,S,CNT1).
total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).
```
