  "HASH": "5E40E418",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in core functionality. Minor edge cases and performance optimizations noted (non-list input handling, sort limited to top 3 elements, recursive sorting performance).",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for stack operations (e.g., `is_list(Stack)` checks).\n2. Extend `sort` to handle entire stack by modifying `get_top_n` to accept variable N.\n3. Replace `insertion_sort` with a more efficient algorithm (e.g., quicksort) for large stacks.",
