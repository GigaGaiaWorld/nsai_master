### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code is an implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze any failures in the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a `member/2` predicate definition. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at the first use of `member/2` in the code (line 4).
- **Issue:** The predicate `member/2` is used to check membership in a list, but it is not defined in the code. The user-defined `my_member/2` is present but not used in place of `member/2`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**
  - The logical correctness of the puzzle constraints is sound, but the implementation fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate.
  - Recursive termination is not an issue here, as the failure is due to a missing definition rather than infinite recursion.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**
  - The code does not use any probabilistic facts or rules, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not applicable here.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents successful execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this implementation.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes the input is a list of five houses, but there is no validation for non-list inputs.
  - The user-defined `my_member/2` is redundant since it is not used in place of `member/2`.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate     | Prevents execution of the query | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` or define `member/2`. |
| 2      | Unused `my_member/2` predicate   | Redundant code                  | Remove or replace `member/2` with `my_member/2`. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace all occurrences of `member/2` with `my_member/2` in the code, or define the `member/2` predicate as follows:
```prolog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|Y]) :- member(X, Y).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is logically correct but fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Once this issue is resolved, the code should execute successfully. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
