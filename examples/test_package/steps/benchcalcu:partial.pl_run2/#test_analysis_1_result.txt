#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Cryptoaddition Code: Functional and Logical Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` must hold true, with each letter representing a unique digit (0-9) and the first digit of each number being non-zero. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 queries, all of which return a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the solutions are valid and deterministic.  

**Test Results:**  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly enforces the constraints of the cryptoaddition problem, ensuring unique digits and valid arithmetic operations.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified for correctness:  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures the first digit is non-zero.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column addition with carry.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures all digits are unique.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `sumdigit` and `all_different` are logically sound. The recursive termination in `all_different` is ensured by the base case `all_different([])` and the recursive step.  
- **Arithmetic Constraints:** The `sumdigit` predicate correctly handles carry propagation and digit constraints.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is involved.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition problem using deterministic logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `all_different` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures this by construction.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to the number of digits (5), so performance is not an issue.

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The code is functionally correct and adheres to the problem constraints. No errors or improvements are identified.
