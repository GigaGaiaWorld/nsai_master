### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Evaluation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The expressions include numbers and operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The evaluation involves:
- Detecting numbers and operators from images.
- Parsing the list of symbols into an arithmetic expression.
- Evaluating the expression with an `almost_equal` predicate to handle floating-point precision.

The purpose of this report is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze potential failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The expected result for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` is `-13.6667`.
  - The actual result is `0.0000`, which is incorrect.

**Conclusion:** The test failed. The actual result does not match the expected result.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` returned `0.0000` instead of `-13.6667`.
- **Error Location:**
  - The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It lacks rules for subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
  - The current implementation only handles addition (`+`), as seen in the code block:
    ```prolog
    parse([N1, + | T], R) :- 
        parse(T, R1),
        R is N1 + R1.
    ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `parse/2` predicate is not fully defined to handle all four operations. This violates the requirement to support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - The recursive termination condition (`parse([N], R)`) is correct, but the intermediate steps are incomplete.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code correctly detects numbers and operators but fails to parse and evaluate all operations.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be problematic for very long expressions.
  - Division by zero is not checked.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing parse rules for `-`, `*`, `/` | Incorrect evaluation of expressions | Add predicates for subtraction, multiplication, and division.              |
| 2      | No handling of division by zero  | Potential runtime error       | Add a check for division by zero in the `parse/2` predicate.              |
| 3      | Non-list input not handled       | Potential runtime error       | Add input validation to ensure the input is a list.                       |

### **Final Remarks**
The code partially meets the requirements but fails to evaluate expressions correctly due to incomplete parsing rules. The primary issue is the lack of support for subtraction, multiplication, and division. Addressing these gaps and edge cases will ensure robust functionality. No DeepProbLog features are used, and probabilistic compliance is irrelevant in this context.
