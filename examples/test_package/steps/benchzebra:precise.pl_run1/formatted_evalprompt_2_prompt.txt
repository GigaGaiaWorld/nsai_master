<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Identify any errors or failures in the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a `member/2` predicate in the ProbLog environment. The error message is:
```prolog
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```
This suggests that the predicate `member/2` is not defined or imported in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The entire `zebra/1` predicate fails because it relies on `member/2`, which is undefined.
- **Code Line**: The error originates from the first use of `member/2` in the code block (line 4).
- **Root Cause**: The `member/2` predicate is not part of ProbLog's standard library, and the code does not provide a custom definition for it.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**: 
  - The `member/2` predicate is a standard Prolog predicate, but it is not natively available in ProbLog unless explicitly defined or imported.
  - The code includes a custom `my_member/2` predicate, but it is not used in place of `member/2`.
- **ProbLog Context**: 
  - ProbLog does not implicitly support all Prolog predicates. Missing predicates must be explicitly defined or imported.
  - The error indicates a lack of compatibility between the Prolog-style code and ProbLog's execution environment.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents successful execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here, as the code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code assumes the availability of Prolog predicates like `member/2`, which is incorrect for ProbLog.
  - The custom `my_member/2` predicate is defined but unused, indicating a potential oversight.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Entire query fails              | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` or define `member/2`. |
| 2      | Unused `my_member/2` predicate   | Redundant code                  | Remove or utilize the custom predicate.     |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code fails due to the absence of the `member/2` predicate in ProbLog. To resolve this, either replace `member/2` with the provided `my_member/2` or define `member/2` explicitly. The rest of the logic appears correct but cannot be verified until this issue is resolved. No DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation. 

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
