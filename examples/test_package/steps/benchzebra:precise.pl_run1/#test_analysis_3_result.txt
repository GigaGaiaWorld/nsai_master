### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle, verifying whether the solution adheres to the specified requirements and constraints.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code was tested with the following query and result:
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**  
  The result satisfies all the given constraints (e.g., Norwegian in the first house, green house to the right of ivory, etc.).  
  **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided implementation. All predicates and rules were correctly defined and executed as expected. The following predicates were verified:
- `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`, and `houses/1` are correctly implemented and terminate properly.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
  The logical correctness of the implementation is confirmed. Recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) terminate correctly as they handle base cases and recursive cases appropriately.
  
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)`). It is purely deterministic.  
  **Note:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The solution correctly deduces the house arrangement based on the given constraints.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog features absent).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The input to `houses/1` is always a list of 5 houses, so non-list inputs are not a concern.  
  - Recursive predicates are well-defined and terminate.  
  - No undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and robust, satisfying all the given constraints of the Zebra Puzzle. No failures or edge cases were identified. The absence of probabilistic or DeepProbLog features does not impact the correctness of the solution, as it is purely deterministic.
