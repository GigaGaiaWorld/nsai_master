### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Identify any errors or failures in the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a `member/2` predicate in the ProbLog environment. The error message is:
```prolog
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```
This suggests that the predicate `member/2` is not defined or imported in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The entire `zebra/1` predicate fails because it relies on `member/2`, which is undefined.
- **Code Line**: The error originates from the first use of `member/2` in the code block (line 4).
- **Root Cause**: The `member/2` predicate is not part of ProbLog's standard library, and the code does not provide a custom definition for it.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**: 
  - The `member/2` predicate is a standard Prolog predicate, but it is not natively available in ProbLog unless explicitly defined or imported.
  - The code includes a custom `my_member/2` predicate, but it is not used in place of `member/2`.
- **ProbLog Context**: 
  - ProbLog does not implicitly support all Prolog predicates. Missing predicates must be explicitly defined or imported.
  - The error indicates a lack of compatibility between the Prolog-style code and ProbLog's execution environment.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents successful execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here, as the code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code assumes the availability of Prolog predicates like `member/2`, which is incorrect for ProbLog.
  - The custom `my_member/2` predicate is defined but unused, indicating a potential oversight.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Entire query fails              | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` or define `member/2`. |
| 2      | Unused `my_member/2` predicate   | Redundant code                  | Remove or utilize the custom predicate.     |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code fails due to the absence of the `member/2` predicate in ProbLog. To resolve this, either replace `member/2` with the provided `my_member/2` or define `member/2` explicitly. The rest of the logic appears correct but cannot be verified until this issue is resolved. No DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
