### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.5898 |
| `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0900 |
| `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0100 |
| `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.5670 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4330 |
| `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key interactions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive predicates (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) correctly terminate and propagate state changes.  
- The `at/3` predicates for robot movement handle both success and failure cases (`goto_succeeds` and `goto_fails`) appropriately.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds`, `drop_slippery_key`, and `fumbles_key` comply with the rule `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- The negation-as-failure (`\+`) is correctly used in predicates like `drops/2` and `carrying/2`.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key interactions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic rules are correctly implemented and evaluated.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases such as the robot failing to move (`goto_fails`) and the key being slippery (`slippery/2`).  
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
