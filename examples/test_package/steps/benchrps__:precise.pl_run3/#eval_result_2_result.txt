  "ErrorSummary": "The `->/2` operator is not supported in ProbLog, causing the predicate to fail during execution.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the conditional logic in `determine_winner/3` with ProbLog-compatible constructs. For example, use `if_then_else/3` or restructure the logic without `->/2`. Example fix:\n\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- \n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), \n    compute_score(Results, Score), \n    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; \n     Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; \n     Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').",
