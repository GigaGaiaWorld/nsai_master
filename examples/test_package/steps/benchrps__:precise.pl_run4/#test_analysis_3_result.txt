### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, focusing on:
- Classical Prolog reasoning (e.g., recursive termination, logical correctness).
- Probabilistic reasoning (if applicable).
- Functional requirements (e.g., determining the winner from a list of moves).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
**Query Tested:**
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```

**Results:**
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Draw') = 1.0000`

**Analysis:**
- The results are contradictory. The game cannot simultaneously declare `'Player 2'` as the winner and a `'Draw'` for the same input.
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to incorrect logic in the `determine_winner/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Predicate:** `determine_winner/3`  
**Code Block:**
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1';
     Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2';
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

**Issue:**
- The predicate does not handle the case where the score is zero (a draw) correctly. The logic allows both `'Player 2'` and `'Draw'` to be true simultaneously.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog:**
- The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are logically correct and terminate properly.
- The error lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, where the disjunction (`;`) is not mutually exclusive.

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The issue is purely logical.

**DeepProbLog:**
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core logic (`play/3`, `compute_score/2`) works, but the final winner determination is flawed.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `determine_winner(rock, paper, W)`).
- Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `determine_winner/3` logic flaw | Incorrect winner determination  | Modify the predicate to ensure mutually exclusive conditions for `Winner`. |
| 2   | Non-list input handling         | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation to ensure `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists.         |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation requires minor fixes to ensure correctness, particularly in the `determine_winner/3` predicate. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are involved.
