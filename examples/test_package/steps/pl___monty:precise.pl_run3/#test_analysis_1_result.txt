### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation models the problem to verify the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (each door has an equal chance of hiding the prize).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the theoretical probabilities (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules adhere to the requirements:  
- The `open_door/1` rules correctly handle the cases where one or two doors are available for opening.  
- The `win_keep` and `win_switch` predicates accurately reflect the outcomes of keeping or switching the initial choice.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list membership checks.  
- Recursion in `member/2` terminates as expected.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly defined as `1/3` for each door.  
- The negation `\+ prize(A)` and implications in the `open_door/1` rules comply with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic correctly models the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases such as only one available door (`open_door/1` rule).  
- Input validation (e.g., non-list input) is not required here, as the problem is constrained to three doors.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words.

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's theoretical probabilities. No issues were identified during evaluation.
