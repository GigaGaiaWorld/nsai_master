  "HASH": "06576BEB",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. Edge cases (non-list inputs, deep recursion) are not handled but were not part of the original requirements.",
  "SuggestedFix": "None needed for the current requirements. For robustness, consider adding input validation (e.g., `number(X, _) :- is_list(X), ...`) and tail recursion optimization if long lists are expected.",
  "Dependencies": [],
