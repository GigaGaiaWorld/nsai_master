<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a set of coins (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads after all tosses. The code uses probabilistic facts (`coin/1`) and recursive logic (`coins_r/3`) to achieve this. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 9:26.
```

- **Failed Query**: `query(total(_))`  
  - **Expected Result**: A probabilistic distribution of the total number of heads after 4 coin tosses.  
  - **Actual Result**: Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator in the recursive rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `coins_r/3`  
  - **Code Block**:  
    ```prolog
    coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
        CNT > 0,
        coin(CNT),
        (make_coin(CNT, 0.8) -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC is SC),
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT).
    ```
  - **Error Location**: Line 9, column 26 (the `->/2` operator).  
  - **Issue**: The `->/2` operator is not correctly defined or supported in the ProbLog context for this usage.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive logic is sound, but the use of `->/2` is problematic. ProbLog does not natively support the Prolog `->/2` operator for probabilistic reasoning.  
  - The termination condition (`CNT > 0`) is correct, but the recursion fails due to the unresolved `->/2` operator.

- **Probabilistic Compliance**:  
  - The code attempts to use `make_coin/2` to define a probabilistic fact, but the `->/2` operator disrupts the probabilistic reasoning flow.  
  - The negation/implication rules (`P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`) are not violated, but the implementation is incorrect.

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the `->/2` operator is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to the `->/2` error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle edge cases like `CNT = 0` explicitly (though the base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` is defined).  
  - Performance for deep recursion is not tested but could be problematic for large `CNT`.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator       | Recursive logic fails           | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `probabilistic_if/3`). |
| 2   | Probabilistic fact misuse       | Incorrect probability handling  | Use `probabilistic_fact/2` for coin tosses. |

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires revision to replace the `->/2` operator with a ProbLog-compatible construct and ensure proper probabilistic fact handling.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
