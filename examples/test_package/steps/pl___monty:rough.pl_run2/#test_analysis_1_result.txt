### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., Monty's door-opening behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic and correct.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the theoretical expectations (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:
1. **Uniform Random Opening:** When two doors are available, Monty chooses one uniformly (`0.5::open_door(Door)`).
2. **Forced Opening:** When only one door is available, Monty must open it (implied by the `findall` and `length` checks).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog:**
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list traversal.
- Recursion in `member/2` terminates as expected.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Reasoning:**
- The negation `\+ prize(Door)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.
- The uniform choice (`0.5::open_door(Door)`) is correctly applied when two doors are available.

**DeepProbLog:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Satisfied (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented (e.g., uniform choice, negation).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list input; undefined behavior for non-lists.
- **Deep Recursion:** Not an issue here due to small problem size.
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.
