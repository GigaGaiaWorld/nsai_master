### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of these operations and analyze their behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts. The evaluation focuses on:
- Test results verification.
- Failure localization.
- Root cause analysis.
- Overall functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:
- `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000

**Observation**: All queries returned a probability of `0.0000`, indicating that none of the operations were successfully executed. This suggests a failure in the implementation or missing definitions for the operations.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Queries**: All queries (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) failed.
- **Root Cause**: The code only defines the `sort` operation (`stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)`). The other operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are not implemented, leading to their failure.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `sort` operation is correctly implemented for stacks of length â‰¥ 3. However, the other operations are undefined.
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here since the operations are not recursive.
- **ProbLog Context**:
  - The probabilistic results (`0.0000`) indicate that the operations are not defined, and ProbLog treats undefined predicates as failing.
  - No probabilistic facts or implications are involved in this code.
- **DeepProbLog**:
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (only `sort` is implemented).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Undefined operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are not gracefully managed.
  - No checks for stack underflow (e.g., `pop` on an empty stack).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing implementations for `push`, `pop`, etc. | All operations fail | Implement the missing operations. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation. |
| 3   | No edge case handling (e.g., empty stack) | Unpredictable behavior | Add checks for edge cases. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The current implementation only supports the `sort` operation, leaving all other stack operations undefined. To meet the requirements, the missing operations must be implemented, and edge cases should be addressed. The probabilistic results (`0.0000`) are expected due to the lack of definitions. No DeepProbLog features are used.
