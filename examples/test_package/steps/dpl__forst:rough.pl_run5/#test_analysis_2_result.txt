### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:
- `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (probability `0.0000` for all queries).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
The failures indicate that the predicates for the stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are either missing or incorrectly implemented. The provided code only includes a partial implementation for the `sort` operation, which is not tested in the given queries.

**Specific Issues:**
- Missing predicates for `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`.
- The `sort` operation is implemented but not tested.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- The `sort` operation is logically correct but incomplete (only handles stacks of length â‰¥ 3).
- The other operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are not implemented, leading to test failures.

**ProbLog Analysis:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code.
- The test results show `0.0000` probabilities, indicating that the queries do not match any defined rules.

**DeepProbLog:**
- No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (only `sort` is implemented).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not utilized.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- Non-list inputs are not handled.
- Recursive performance is not tested due to missing implementations.
- Undefined operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are not addressed.

|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `push` implementation    | `push` operation fails          | Implement `push` predicate.                |

| 3   | Missing `dup` implementation     | `dup` operation fails           | Implement `dup` predicate.                 |
| 4   | Missing `swap` implementation    | `swap` operation fails          | Implement `swap` predicate.                |
| 5   | Missing `over` implementation    | `over` operation fails          | Implement `over` predicate.                |
| 6   | Missing `rot` implementation     | `rot` operation fails           | Implement `rot` predicate.                 |
| 7   | Incomplete `sort` implementation | Untested edge cases (length < 3)| Extend `sort` to handle all stack lengths. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The code requires significant revisions to meet the functional requirements. Implement the missing predicates and ensure comprehensive testing for all stack operations.
