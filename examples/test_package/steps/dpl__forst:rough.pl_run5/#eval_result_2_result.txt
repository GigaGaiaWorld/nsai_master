  "ErrorSummary": "Missing implementations for stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and incomplete sort implementation (only handles stacks of length â‰¥ 3)",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Implement missing predicates for push, pop, dup, swap, over, and rot. 2. Extend sort operation to handle stacks of all lengths (add case for length < 3). Example fix for push: `stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack]).`",
