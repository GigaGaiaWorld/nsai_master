### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The goal is to ensure the code correctly enforces constraints (e.g., unique digits, no leading zeros) and produces valid solutions. This report evaluates the code's correctness, test results, and adherence to ProbLog principles.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following solutions, all with a probability of `1.0000`:  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9])`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0])`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8])`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1])`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2])`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6])`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8])`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5])`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7])`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9])`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The solutions satisfy the constraints of the puzzle (unique digits, no leading zeros, and correct arithmetic).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures no leading zeros.  
- `all_different/1`: Enforces uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Simulates column addition with carry.  
- `query_sum/1`: Combines constraints to solve the puzzle.  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `member/2`, `digit/1`) are correctly defined and used.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to the puzzle's logical constraints. Recursive predicates (e.g., `all_different/1`) terminate correctly.  
- **Arithmetic:** The `sumdigit/5` predicate correctly handles carry propagation and digit sums.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (0–9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not an issue.  

**Suggestions:**  
- Add input validation for robustness.  
- Consider extending the puzzle to include probabilistic constraints for ProbLog features.

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is correct and meets the puzzle's requirements. No failures or issues were detected. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic or neural network features to leverage ProbLog's full capabilities.
