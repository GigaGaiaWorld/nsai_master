### Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Interpretable Merge Sort Algorithm in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`) for sorting lists of numbers. The algorithm recursively splits the list into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
- `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The algorithm correctly sorts the input list, and the result matches the expected output with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` function as intended.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `merge_sort/2`: Lines 1–9  
- `split/3`: Lines 10–13  
- `merge/3`: Lines 14–20  

All predicates are correctly defined and terminate appropriately for valid inputs.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm adheres to the merge sort logic: splitting the list, recursively sorting sublists, and merging them.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) ensure termination. The recursive calls reduce the problem size, guaranteeing termination for finite lists.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, confirming deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used. The code does not involve neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts lists of numbers.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The `is_list(List)` check in `merge_sort/2` ensures only lists are processed.  
- **Empty List:** Handled by the base case `merge_sort([], []).`  
- **Single-element List:** Handled by `merge_sort([X], [X]) :- number(X).`  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may impact performance for very large lists, but this is inherent to merge sort.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is correct and meets classical Prolog requirements. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases are handled appropriately, and the code is logically sound. For future enhancements, consider adding support for probabilistic sorting or integrating neural networks for hybrid reasoning.
