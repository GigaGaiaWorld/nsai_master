  "HASH": "DA97FB01",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. The code correctly implements insertion sort and passes the test case. However, it lacks handling for non-list inputs and may face stack overflow for very large lists.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation to handle non-list inputs. 2. Optimize the recursion to avoid stack overflow (e.g., tail recursion or iterative approach).",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
