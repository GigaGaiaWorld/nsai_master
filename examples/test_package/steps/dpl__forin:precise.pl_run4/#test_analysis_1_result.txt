### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules, and ensure it meets the specified functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result matches the expected output, confirming that the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` is correctly sorted into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The implementation adheres to the requirements of recursively sorting the tail list and inserting the head element into the sorted list. No errors were found in the predicates or rules.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are logically correct. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], []).`), and the insertion logic correctly handles element placement.
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion terminates as expected, with the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**:  
  The code does not explicitly use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). However, the result probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic behavior, which is valid for classical sorting tasks.
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report**: DeepProbLog feature not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  The implementation meets the classical reasoning requirements, correctly sorting the input list.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  Not explicitly required or used in this implementation.
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  Not applicable.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-List Input**:  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Deep Recursive Performance**:  
  For very large lists, the recursive approach may lead to stack overflow. An iterative approach or tail recursion optimization could improve performance.
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors             | Add input validation.               |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large N | Optimize for tail recursion.        |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features  | Limited functionality      | Extend for probabilistic scenarios. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The implementation is correct for classical sorting tasks but lacks robustness for edge cases and probabilistic extensions. Enhancements are suggested for broader applicability.
