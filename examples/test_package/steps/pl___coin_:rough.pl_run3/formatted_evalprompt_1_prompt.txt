    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads after all tosses. The code uses recursion to achieve this. However, the test results indicate an error related to non-ground probabilistic clauses. This report evaluates the code's correctness, identifies failures, and provides suggestions for improvement.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(_)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = self.handle_nonground(
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
  problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```  
- **Conclusion:** The test failed due to a non-ground probabilistic clause.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(_)`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate/Rule:** `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`  
  - **Line Number:** 1:5 (the line where `make_coin(C,PH)` is defined).  
- **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground because `C` is not instantiated when the fact is used. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be ground (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct and terminates when `CNT` reaches 0.  
  - However, the issue arises from the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,PH)`, which violates ProbLog's requirement for groundness.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The error occurs because `make_coin(C,PH)` is not ground. ProbLog does not allow non-ground probabilistic clauses.  
  - The computation of probabilistic facts (`P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, etc.) is irrelevant here because the code fails before reaching that stage.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the probabilistic fact is problematic).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic clause.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle edge cases like `CNT = 0` explicitly (though the base case exists).  
  - Non-ground probabilistic facts are a critical oversight.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | Code fails to execute          | Instantiate `C` in `make_coin(C,PH)` (e.g., `make_coin(c1,0.8)`).          |
| 2      | Undefined edge case for `CNT = 0` | Potential logical inconsistency | Explicitly handle `CNT = 0` in `coins_r/3` to ensure clarity.              |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code's primary issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause, which must be fixed for the program to run. Once corrected, the recursive logic should work as intended. Edge cases and probabilistic grounding must be carefully addressed to ensure robustness.  

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
