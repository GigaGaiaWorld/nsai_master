  "ErrorSummary": "Incorrect joint probability calculation in recursive predicate 'coins_r/3'. The current implementation does not account for probabilistic independence of coin tosses, leading to an incorrect result for 'total(4)'.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the 'coins_r/3' predicate to multiply probabilities for independent events. For example, replace the current logic with a probabilistic sum over all possible outcomes (heads/tails) at each step, ensuring the joint probability is correctly accumulated. Specifically, update the recursive clause to:\n\ncoins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-\n    CNT > 0,\n    (prob_coin(c1, 0.8), NewSC is SC + 1 ; prob_coin(c1, 0.2), NewSC is SC),\n    NewCNT is CNT - 1,\n    coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT).\n\nEnsure 'prob_coin/2' is defined to handle probabilistic events correctly.",
