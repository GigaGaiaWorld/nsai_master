### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, where two players submit lists of moves (`P1Moves` and `P2Moves`), and the system determines the winner based on the game's rules. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog and ProbLog rules.
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],'Player 2') = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins two rounds (paper beats rock, paper beats rock) and loses one (scissor loses to rock), resulting in a net score of `-1` (Player 2 wins).
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The predicates `play/3`, `result/3`, and `compute_score/2` function as intended.
- **Expansion Predicates:** Not applicable (no expansion predicates like `implies/2` or `opposite/1` are used).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` correctly model the game's win-lose relationships.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates terminate correctly for empty lists.
- **ProbLog:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
- **DeepProbLog:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Uneven Lists:** If the move lists are of unequal length, the behavior is undefined (no handling for this case).
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion for very long lists could impact performance, but this is unlikely in practice.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Uneven move lists | Undefined behavior | Ensure lists are of equal length or handle mismatches. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code is logically correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs or uneven move lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. The test case provided passes successfully, confirming the core functionality.
