### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Identify potential edge cases and performance issues.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The code was tested with the query:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented as per the requirements:
1. **Boundary Conditions:** The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are correctly handled.
2. **Recursive Splitting:** The `split_list` predicate correctly divides the list into two halves.
3. **Merging:** The `merge` predicate correctly combines two sorted lists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation adheres to the merge sort algorithm:
  - The list is split into two halves recursively until base cases are reached.
  - The `merge` predicate ensures the sorted order is maintained.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly for lists of length 0 or 1.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- The test case does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is required here.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The merge sort logic is correctly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this test case.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists may lead to stack overflow, but this is a general limitation of Prolog.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion risk         | Stack overflow for large lists  | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The merge sort implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features were used in this example.
