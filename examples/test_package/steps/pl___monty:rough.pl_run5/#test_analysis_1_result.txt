### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, adherence to probabilistic rules, and functional requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a player selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The player can either keep their initial choice or switch doors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities:  
- The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is 1/3.  
- The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is 2/3.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- `prize/1`: Uniform distribution across doors (lines 1-2).  
- `select_door/1`: Fixed selection of door 1 (line 3).  
- `open_door/1`: Correctly implements the Monty Hall rules (lines 5-10).  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch`: Accurately compute the winning probabilities (lines 12-18).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `member/2` and `open_door/1` are logically sound. Recursion in `member/2` terminates correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The negation `\+ prize(Door)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
  - The uniform choice in `open_door/1` (when two doors are available) adheres to probabilistic fairness.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules for door selection and prize distribution are correctly implemented.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for `win_keep` and `win_switch` are accurate.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid door numbers (1, 2, 3). Non-integer or out-of-range inputs are not handled.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not a concern.

**Code Blocks:**  
```prolog
% Prize distribution
1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).
select_door(1).

% Monty's door opening logic
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(Door, [1,2,3]),
    \+ prize(Door),
    \+ (Door = Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), \+ (D = Selected)), Ds),
    length(Ds, 2),
    member(Door, Ds),
    0.5::open_door(Door).
```

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified during evaluation. For future enhancements, consider handling edge cases like invalid inputs.
