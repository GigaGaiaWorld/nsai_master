### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The code is tested for classical Prolog functionality, recursive termination, and adherence to the specified requirements. The evaluation also verifies the absence of DeepProbLog features and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:**  
  The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:
  1. **Length Calculation and Boundary Check:**  
     The `length(List, Len)` and `Len > 1` conditions ensure recursive splitting only occurs for lists longer than 1.
  2. **Recursive Sorting:**  
     The `merge_sort` predicate correctly splits the list into `Left` and `Right` and recursively sorts them.
  3. **Merging:**  
     The `merge` predicate combines the sorted sublists into the final result.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:**  
    The predicates `split_list`, `merge`, and `append` are correctly defined and ensure the list is split, sorted, and merged as expected.
  - **Recursive Termination:**  
    The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination for empty and single-element lists.
  
- **ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.
  - **DeepProbLog Features:**  
    The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
    **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog predicates.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the list length, but no performance issues are evident for typical inputs.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`split_list`, `merge`, `append`) are correctly defined.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used     | Limited to classical reasoning  | Consider extending for probabilistic use cases. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The merge sort implementation is correct for classical Prolog scenarios and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. Future improvements could include input validation and integration of probabilistic reasoning.
