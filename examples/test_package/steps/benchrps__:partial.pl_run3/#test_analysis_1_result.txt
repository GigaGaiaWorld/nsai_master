### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because they have two wins (paper beats rock) and one loss (scissor loses to rock), resulting in a net score of -1 (player2 wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`). Thus, this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The rules for `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `result/3` are correctly defined.  
  - The recursive predicate `play/3` correctly processes lists of moves and computes results.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate accurately calculates the score based on win/lose/draw outcomes.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.  
  - The recursive case `play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs])` correctly reduces the problem size.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`). Thus, probabilistic reasoning compliance is not applicable.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  The code does not use neural network integration (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`). **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes results.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes inputs are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Undefined Moves**: If a move is not defined in `move/1`, the `result/3` predicate will fail.  
- **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Undefined moves          | Predicate failure          | Ensure all moves are defined.       |
| 3      | No probabilistic facts   | Limited functionality      | Extend for probabilistic scenarios. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The code is logically correct and passes all provided tests. However, it lacks handling for edge cases and probabilistic features, which could be addressed for robustness and extended functionality.
