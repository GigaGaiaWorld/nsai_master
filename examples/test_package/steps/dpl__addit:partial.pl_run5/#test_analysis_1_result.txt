### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of facts representing digits (0–9) associated with image identifiers (`img_1` to `img_0`). It also includes a rule for performing addition (`addition/3`) and a query to test the addition of two digits (`img_5` and `img_6`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z))`.  
- **Result**:  
  - `addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000`.  

**Verification**:  
- The query correctly computes the sum of the digits associated with `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6), yielding 11 with a probability of 1.0000.  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Expansion Predicates**: The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.), so no verification is required for these.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
- **Logical Correctness**: The `addition/3` rule is logically correct. It retrieves the digits associated with the input images and computes their sum.  
- **Recursive Termination**: No recursion is used in the provided code, so termination is not a concern.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
- The code uses deterministic facts (`digit/2`), so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` are not applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog Integration**:  
- The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements**:  
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The `addition/3` rule performs classical arithmetic reasoning.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (only deterministic facts are used).  
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

**Edge Cases**:  
- The code does not handle edge cases such as:  
  - Non-existent image identifiers (e.g., `digit(img_10,10)`).  
  - Invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values).  
- **Suggestion**: Add validation rules or default behaviors for such cases.

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                     | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | No edge case handling       | Potential runtime errors   | Add validation for input images and digits. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used        | Limited functionality      | Consider integrating neural networks.       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Notes**:  
The code is functionally correct for the given requirements but lacks robustness for edge cases and advanced features like DeepProbLog integration. Enhancements in these areas would improve its reliability and versatility.
