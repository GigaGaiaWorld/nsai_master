### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Addition**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a simple addition operation between digits represented as images (`img_1` to `img_0`). The goal is to verify the correctness of the `addition/3` predicate and ensure it meets the specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning, as no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes, as the sum of the digits `5` and `6` is correctly computed as `11`.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The single test case provided passes, and no other queries were tested.  
  - **Expansion Predicates**: Not applicable, as no expansion predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) are used in the code.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The `addition/3` predicate is logically correct. It retrieves the numeric values of the input images using `digit/2` and computes their sum using `Z is A + B`.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: Not applicable, as the predicate is non-recursive.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the code. The result `1.0000` indicates certainty, which aligns with classical Prolog behavior.  

- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the addition logic for the given inputs.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code does not handle cases where `digit/2` facts are missing for some images. For example, `addition(img_10, img_1, Z)` would fail.  
  - **Non-Image Inputs**: The code assumes inputs are of the form `img_X`. Non-conforming inputs (e.g., `addition(5, 6, Z)`) would fail.  
  - **Performance**: Not a concern for this simple predicate.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `digit/2` facts   | Queries with missing images fail | Add error handling or default facts |
| 2      | Non-image inputs unsupported | Incorrect inputs cause failure  | Validate input format               |

**Final Notes**:  
The code meets the basic requirements for classical reasoning but lacks robustness for edge cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Enhancements could include input validation and handling of undefined cases.
