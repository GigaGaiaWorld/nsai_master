<Code>
<Langda>
<Code_Block>swap([X, Y | T], [Y, X | T], X, Y) :- X > Y.
swap([X | T], [X | T1], A, B) :- swap(T, T1, A, B).

query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:

    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for '!/0' at 6:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning, as the code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for '!/0' at 6:5.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
  - **Expected Result:** A sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to undefined `!/0` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 6: `!` (cut operator) in the `bubblesort/3` predicate.  
  - **Issue:** The cut operator `!` is not recognized in ProbLog, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.  

- **Affected Predicate:**  
  - `bubblesort/3` (Lines 5–9).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**  
  - The `swap/4` predicate is logically correct for swapping elements in a list.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate attempts to use the cut operator `!` to enforce deterministic behavior, which is not supported in ProbLog.  

- **ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is tested.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion in `swap/4` and `bubblesort/3` is well-defined and terminates when the list is sorted.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (fails due to unsupported cut operator).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - The cut operator `!` is not supported in ProbLog, which is a critical oversight.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `!/0` in ProbLog | Program fails to execute        | Remove the cut operator or replace with ProbLog-compatible logic. |
| 2   | No edge case handling       | May crash on invalid inputs     | Add input validation for lists.     |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Conclusion:**  
The bubblesort implementation fails due to the unsupported cut operator in ProbLog. Addressing this issue and adding edge case handling would improve robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
