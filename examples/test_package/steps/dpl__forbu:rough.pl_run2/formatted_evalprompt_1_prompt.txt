</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code aims to implement an interpretable `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog. The goal is to sort a list of integers using the bubblesort algorithm. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`. However, the execution resulted in an error due to the absence of the `bubblesort/3` predicate. This report evaluates the code's correctness, identifies failures, and provides suggestions for improvement.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 3:21.
  ```  
- **Conclusion:** The test failed because the `bubblesort/3` predicate is not defined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs at line 3, where the `bubblesort/3` predicate is called but not defined.  
- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
  ```  
- **Issue:** The `bubblesort/3` predicate is missing, causing the program to fail.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**  
  - The `swap/4` predicate is correctly defined for swapping elements, but it is not integrated into a complete `bubblesort/3` algorithm.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate is required to implement the recursive sorting logic but is absent.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and does not involve probabilistic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (only `swap/4` is defined).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The input list is assumed to be valid, but non-list inputs or edge cases (e.g., empty lists) are not handled.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate is missing, which is critical for the algorithm.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1   | `bubblesort/3` predicate missing | Program fails to execute       | Implement the `bubblesort/3` logic |
| 2   | No edge case handling            | May fail for non-list inputs   | Add input validation               |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The provided code fails due to the absence of the `bubblesort/3` predicate, which is essential for the sorting algorithm. The `swap/4` predicate is correctly defined but unused. To fix this, implement the `bubblesort/3` logic and ensure edge cases are handled. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are involved in this scenario.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
