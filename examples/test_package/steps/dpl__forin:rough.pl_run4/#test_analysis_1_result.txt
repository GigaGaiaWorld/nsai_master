### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify its correctness, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with the requirements of interpretability. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` and verifying the output.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list.  
- **Verification:** "All tests passed (no failures)."  

The test passed because the predicate correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm, recursively inserting each element into its appropriate position in the sorted sublist.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verification of Expansion Predicates:**  
  - The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**  
  - **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are logically correct. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], []).`).  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, ensuring termination for finite lists.  

- **ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so probabilistic correctness (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not applicable.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
  - **Performance:** The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Performance for large lists | Inefficient for large datasets  | Consider alternative algorithms (e.g., quicksort). |

insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :- X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :- X > Y, insert(X, Ys, Zs).
