  "ErrorSummary": "Syntax error in `open_door/1` due to misplaced parentheses and incorrect probabilistic logic. The predicate does not implement uniform random selection or deterministic opening of doors as required.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Rewrite the `open_door/1` predicate as follows:\n1. For the case with two doors: `open_door(Door) :- select_door(Selected), member(Door, [1,2,3]), \\+ prize(Door), \\+ (Door = Selected), findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \\+ prize(OtherDoor), \\+ (OtherDoor = Selected)), Doors), length(Doors, 2), member(Door, Doors), 0.5::open_door(Door).`\n2. For the case with one door: `open_door(Door) :- select_door(Selected), member(Door, [1,2,3]), \\+ prize(Door), \\+ (Door = Selected), \\+ (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \\+ prize(OtherDoor), \\+ (OtherDoor = Selected), OtherDoor \\= Door).`",
