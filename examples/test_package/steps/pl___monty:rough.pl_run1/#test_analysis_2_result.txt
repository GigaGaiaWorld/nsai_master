### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the specified requirements. The code defines the problem's rules and tests the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the chosen door.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- All probabilities are correct. The uniform distribution of `prize/1` and the deterministic `select_door(1)` are accurate.  
- The probabilities for `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the theoretical expectations (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- `open_door/1` adheres to the requirements:  
  1. If two doors are available, Monty chooses uniformly at random.  
  2. If only one door is available, Monty must open it.  
- The auxiliary predicates (`member/2`) are correctly implemented.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` and `member/2` are logically sound. Recursion in `member/2` terminates correctly.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases (e.g., no prize behind doors) as specified.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly defined (uniform distribution).  
- The negation in `win_switch` (`\+ open_door(A)`) complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration is used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules for door selection and prize distribution are correctly implemented.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases and Performance:**  
- The code handles non-list inputs gracefully (e.g., `member/2` is robust).  
- No deep recursion or performance issues are observed.  

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
- Add comments to clarify the logic of `open_door/1` for readability.  
- Consider testing with varying `select_door` values to ensure generality.
