### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the probabilistic reasoning and logical rules defined in the code. The analysis includes verifying the test results, identifying failures, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate. The error message highlights an unmatched character `(` at line 6, column 111. This prevents the code from being executed, and no query results are returned.

**Failed Queries:**  
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed to execute due to the syntax error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error is localized to the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically in the following code block:

```prolog
open_door(Door) :- 
    select_door(Selected), 
    member(Door, [1,2,3]), 
    \+ prize(Door), 
    \+ (Door = Selected), 
    findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(OtherDoor), \+ (OtherDoor = Selected), Doors), 
    length(Doors, 2), 
    member(Door, Doors), 
    0.5::open_door(Door).
```

**Issues Identified:**  
1. **Syntax Error:** The `findall/3` predicate is incorrectly formatted, with misplaced parentheses and commas.  
2. **Logical Error:** The probabilistic fact `0.5::open_door(Door)` is incorrectly placed and does not align with the requirements for uniform random selection or deterministic opening of doors.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Context:**  
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list membership.  
- The recursive termination of `member/2` is valid.  

**ProbLog Context:**  
- The `open_door/1` predicate does not comply with the probabilistic rules. Specifically:  
  - The uniform random selection between two doors is not implemented correctly.  
  - The deterministic opening of a single door is missing.  
- The negation `\+ prize(Door)` is correctly used, but the overall probabilistic logic is flawed.  

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (e.g., `member/2` works, but `open_door/1` fails).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to incorrect implementation of `open_door/1`.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The `findall/3` predicate may fail for non-list inputs (though not tested).  
- The recursive depth of `member/2` is negligible for small lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `open_door/1` | Code cannot execute | Fix the `findall/3` predicate and ensure proper parentheses. |
| 2   | Incorrect probabilistic logic in `open_door/1` | Requirements not met | Implement uniform random selection and deterministic opening as specified. |
| 3   | Missing deterministic case in `open_door/1` | Incomplete functionality | Add a clause for the case where only one door is available to open. |

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails due to syntax and logical errors in the `open_door/1` predicate. Addressing these issues will ensure compliance with the Monty Hall problem requirements and ProbLog semantics.
