### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap positioning. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while avoiding overrun exceptions. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and classical logic, as well as the adherence to functional requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` over five time steps:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities:**
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities:**
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) comply with the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.
  - Logical correctness is verified by the predicates `legal_flap_position`, `goal_reached`, and `overrun_exception`.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` are correctly defined and sum to 1.
  - The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.

- **DeepProbLog:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly models the flap movement and exceptions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed correctly, and the results are consistent.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The system handles edge cases such as `overrun_exception` when the flap position is illegal.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  - Recursive performance is efficient for the given time steps.
