Here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> blocks in the <origin_code>:

```problog
{"HASH": "D316E87D", "Code": "next_to(house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), house(blue, _, _, _, _), Houses)"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "CFE3727A", "Code": ""}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "87D90A3D", "Code": ""}
```

Explanation:
1. The first <langda> block (HASH D316E87D) corresponds to the requirement "The Norwegian lives next to the blue house", which is implemented in the generated code as `next_to(house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), house(blue, _, _, _, _), Houses)`.
2. The second <langda> block (HASH CFE3727A) has the requirement "Someone has a zebra", but this is already handled by the main predicate `zebra(Houses)` and doesn't require additional code.
3. The third <langda> block (HASH 87D90A3D) has the requirement "Some people drink water", but this is implicitly handled by the existing constraints and doesn't require additional code.
