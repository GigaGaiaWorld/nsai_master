### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules.
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic and correct.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the expected probabilities (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:
1. **Uniform Random Selection:** When two doors are available, `open_door/1` selects one uniformly (50% probability).
2. **Forced Selection:** When only one door is available, it is opened deterministically.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog:**
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list traversal.
- Recursion in `member/2` terminates correctly.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Reasoning:**
- The negation `\+ prize(Door)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.
- The uniform selection in `open_door/1` is correctly implemented using `0.5::open_door(Door)`.

**DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Correctly implemented (e.g., `member/2`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Complies with probabilistic rules (e.g., uniform selection).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined Predicates:** None.
- **Non-list Input:** Not tested, but `member/2` assumes list input.
- **Recursive Performance:** No deep recursion observed.

**Code Blocks:**
```prolog
% Correct implementation of open_door/1
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(Door, [1,2,3]),
    \+ prize(Door),
    \+ (Door = Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), \+ (D = Selected)), Doors),
    length(Doors, 2),
    member(Door, Doors),
    0.5::open_door(Door).
```

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Verdict:** The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified.
