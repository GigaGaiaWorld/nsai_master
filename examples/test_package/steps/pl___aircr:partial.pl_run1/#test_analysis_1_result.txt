### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes for reaching a goal position or encountering an overrun exception. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code and its test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries are as follows:

| Query                | Probability Result |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low but increases slightly.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- **`flap_position/2`** (Line 10-12): Correctly updates the flap position if legal.
- **`overrun_exception/1`** (Line 15-17): Correctly triggers an exception for illegal positions.
- **`goal_reached/1`** (Line 20-22): Accurately checks if the goal position is reached.
- **`attempted_flap_position/2`** (Line 25-33): Computes the new position based on actuator strength and wind effects.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to classical Prolog rules, with no infinite recursion or logical inconsistencies.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The probabilities for `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with the rules of probability theory (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). The results reflect the combined effects of actuator choices and wind conditions.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) is used in this code. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The system correctly updates positions and checks for exceptions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities are computed correctly and reflect the system's stochastic nature.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The system handles illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception/1`) and ensures termination by restricting steps to 5 (`at(5)`).
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 450 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic outcomes are consistent with the modeled behavior, and no edge cases were overlooked. No further modifications are necessary.
