#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given constraints. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied and the solution adheres to logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code was tested with the following result:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**. The output matches the expected solution, satisfying all constraints:
  - The owner of the red house is English.
  - The Spanish person has a dog.
  - The green house owner drinks coffee.
  - The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
  - The middle house drinks milk.
  - The snail owner smokes Winstons.
  - The zebra is owned by the Japanese person.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:
- `my_member/2`: Ensures membership constraints.
- `right_of/3` and `next_to/3`: Handle spatial relationships.
- `houses/1`: Defines the structure of the problem.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:
  - The logic is sound, and recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) terminate correctly.
  - No undefined predicates or infinite recursion issues were found.
  
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:
  - The solution does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The solution correctly deduces the arrangement of houses.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The input is constrained to a list of 5 houses, so non-list inputs are not handled.
  - No performance issues were observed, but deep recursion could be a concern for larger puzzles.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Conclusion**
The implementation is correct and robust for the given problem. All constraints are satisfied, and the solution adheres to logical rules. No improvements are necessary for the current scope. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic constraints or neural network integration for more complex variants of the puzzle.
