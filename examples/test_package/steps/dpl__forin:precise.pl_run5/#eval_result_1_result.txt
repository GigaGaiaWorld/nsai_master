{
  "HASH": "DA97FB01",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. The code correctly implements insertion sort and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks input validation for non-list inputs and may risk stack overflow for large lists due to deep recursion.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`) at the start of `insertion_sort/2`. 2. Consider an iterative implementation for large lists to avoid stack overflow.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
