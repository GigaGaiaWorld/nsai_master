### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because they have two wins (paper beats rock) and one loss (scissor loses to rock), resulting in a net score of -1 (player2 wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`), so this step is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The rules for `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `result/3` are correctly defined.  
  - The recursive predicate `play/3` correctly processes lists of moves and computes results.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate accurately calculates the score based on win/lose/draw outcomes.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.  
  - The recursive case `play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs])` correctly reduces the problem size.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`), so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report**: DeepProbLog feature not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes results.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input lists for `play/3` and `determine_winner/3`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Undefined Moves**: If a move not in `{rock, paper, scissor}` is provided, the behavior is undefined.  
- **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth equals the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Undefined moves | Undefined behavior | Extend `move/1` to handle invalid moves. |
| 3      | No probabilistic features | Limited functionality | Consider adding probabilistic rules for varied gameplay. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The implementation is logically correct for classical Prolog but lacks robustness for edge cases and probabilistic features. Enhancements could include input validation and probabilistic extensions.
