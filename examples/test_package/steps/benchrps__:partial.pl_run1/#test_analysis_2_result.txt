### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, including the rules for determining wins, losses, and draws. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because they have two wins (paper beats rock, paper beats rock) and one loss (scissor loses to rock), resulting in a net score of `-1` (player2 wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  All predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the test case aligns with the expected behavior.  
  - **Predicates Verified**:  
    - `move/1`: Correctly defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
    - `beats/2`: Correctly defines the win-lose relationships.  
    - `result/3`: Correctly calculates the outcome of each round.  
    - `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Correctly handle recursion and score computation.  
    - `determine_winner/3`: Correctly determines the winner based on the computed score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are logically sound.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates terminate correctly for empty lists.  
- **ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes valid input lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited by the input list length, which is manageable for typical use cases.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified.

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

**Final Note**: The code is well-structured and functionally correct. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation or extending it to include probabilistic scenarios.
