### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog: Logical Correctness and Probabilistic Compliance**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog program implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) and includes a test query to verify its functionality. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog and ProbLog requirements.  
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query Tested:**  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  
- The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic correctness.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are correctly defined and function as intended.  
- No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this code, so their correctness is not applicable here.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) correctly handles empty lists.  
  - The recursive case (`insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted)`) splits the list and inserts the head into the sorted tail, adhering to the insertion sort algorithm.  
  - The `insert/3` predicate correctly places elements in ascending order.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates when the input list is empty, ensuring no infinite loops.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The result `1.0000` indicates a deterministic outcome, as no probabilistic facts or rules are used.  
- No violations of probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are present.  

**DeepProbLog Analysis:**  
- **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  
- No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The program does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow, though this is unlikely for typical use cases.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error              | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow   | Optimize for large lists if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Notes:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is logically correct and passes all provided tests. However, edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
