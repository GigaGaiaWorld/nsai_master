### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning, as the code does not utilize probabilistic features or DeepProbLog.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` was executed, but the evaluation resulted in an error:  

```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 13:23.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at the line:  
```prolog
(SwapFlag == true ->
    bubblesort(NewL, Acc, Sorted)
;
    append(Acc, NewL, Sorted)
).
```
- **Line Number:** 13  
- **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is not recognized in ProbLog, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The logical correctness of the bubblesort algorithm is sound, but the implementation fails due to the use of Prolog's `->/2` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog.  
  - Recursive termination is correctly handled in the base cases (`bubble([], [], [])` and `bubble([X], [], [X])`).  

- **ProbLog Context:**  
  - The code does not utilize probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The algorithm logic is correct, but the implementation fails due to unsupported syntax.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `forth_sort(3, X)` would fail).  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be problematic for large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator      | Code execution fails            | Replace with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if/3`). |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.               |
| 3   | Deep recursion not tested        | Possible stack overflow         | Test with large lists and optimize. |

**Conclusion:**  
The bubblesort implementation is logically correct but fails due to ProbLog's unsupported syntax. Addressing the `->/2` operator issue and edge cases would resolve the errors. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
