</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) and includes a test query to verify its correctness. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog and ProbLog requirements.  
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test was executed:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed with the expected output.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test. The following predicates were verified:  
- `insertion_sort/2` (lines 1–3): Correctly implements the recursive insertion sort.  
- `insert/3` (lines 4–7): Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`[]`).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, ensuring termination.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The test result (`1.0000`) indicates deterministic behavior, as no probabilistic facts or rules are used.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Status       | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met          | The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.                              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                  |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used    | No `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls are present.                               |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly (`insertion_sort([], []).`).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very long lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add input validation.                      |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow risk        | Optimize for tail recursion or use iteration. |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is correct for classical Prolog but lacks robustness for edge cases. No ProbLog or DeepProbLog features are utilized. Recommendations include input validation and performance optimization.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
