### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation models the problem to verify the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (each door has an equal chance).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the theoretical probabilities (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The implementation correctly adheres to the requirements:  
- When both unselected doors are empty, one is opened randomly (`open_door/1` rule).  
- The probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the door are accurate.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list membership.  
- Recursion in `member/2` terminates as expected.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` sum to 1, complying with probabilistic rules.  
- The negation `\+ prize(A)` correctly computes `P(¬A) = 1 - P(A)`.  
- The `open_door/1` rule ensures that only non-prize doors are opened, and the host's choice is random when both are empty.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Satisfied (e.g., `member/2` and deterministic `select_door/1`).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Satisfied (correct probabilities for `prize/1`, `win_keep`, and `win_switch`).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The input to `member/2` is always a list, avoiding non-list edge cases.  
- The recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not an issue.  
- No undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are present.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are needed.
