#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given constraints. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on:
- **Test Results Verification**: Ensuring all constraints are satisfied.
- **Failure Localization**: Identifying any discrepancies.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Logical and probabilistic correctness.
- **Overall Analysis**: Functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test result for the query `zebra(Houses)` is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**: The output satisfies all constraints specified in the puzzle (e.g., the Norwegian lives next to the blue house, the green house drinks coffee, etc.).
- **Probability Result**: The probability of the solution is `1.0000`, indicating certainty.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**: All constraints are correctly implemented and satisfied in the solution.
- **Verified Predicates**:
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly checks membership.
  - `right_of/3` and `next_to/3`: Correctly enforce spatial relationships.
  - `houses/1`: Defines the structure of the puzzle.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog**:
  - **Logical Correctness**: The rules and constraints are logically sound. For example:
    ```prolog
    my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)
    ```
    correctly enforces that the owner of the red house is English.
  - **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates (e.g., `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) terminate as they reduce the problem size in each step.
- **ProbLog**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Houses` is a list of 5 houses. Non-list inputs would fail.
  - **Deep Recursion**: Not an issue here due to the fixed size of the puzzle.
  - **Undefined Predicates**: All predicates are defined.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and robust. All constraints are satisfied, and the solution is logically sound. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, and edge cases are handled implicitly due to the puzzle's fixed structure.
