### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a `member/2` predicate definition. The error message is as follows:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at the first use of `member/2` in the `zebra` predicate (line 4).
- **Issue:** The `member/2` predicate is used in the code but is not defined. The code includes a custom `my_member/2` predicate, but it is not referenced in the `zebra` predicate.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**
  - The logical correctness of the puzzle constraints is sound, but the implementation fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate.
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here since the failure is due to a missing predicate rather than infinite recursion.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The constraints are correctly specified, but the implementation fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes the input is a list of houses, but there is no validation for non-list inputs.
  - The custom `my_member/2` predicate is defined but not used, which could lead to confusion.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate     | Query fails to execute          | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` or define `member/2`. |
| 2      | Unused `my_member/2` predicate   | Potential confusion             | Remove or use consistently.         |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is logically sound but fails due to a missing predicate definition. The issue can be resolved by either defining the `member/2` predicate or replacing its usage with the provided `my_member/2` predicate. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this code. Addressing the missing predicate will ensure the query executes successfully.
