#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of given constraints. This evaluation assesses the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, verifying whether the solution adheres to the specified rules and requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code was tested with the following query and result:
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```

**Verification:**  
All constraints specified in the requirements are satisfied by the output. For example:
- The Norwegian is in the first house.
- The green house is to the right of the ivory house.
- The middle house drinks milk.
- The Japanese own the zebra and drink coffee.

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates and rules are correctly defined and executed as per the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- The logical correctness of the predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) is verified. Recursive termination is ensured as the base cases and recursive calls are correctly implemented.
- The constraints are correctly encoded, and the solution adheres to the puzzle's rules.

**ProbLog Scenarios:**
- The solution does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The solution correctly solves the puzzle using deterministic logic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are defined.
- **Non-list Input:** The input is explicitly a list of houses, so non-list inputs are not a concern.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and robust, satisfying all specified requirements. No issues or failures were identified during testing. The solution is concise and adheres to the puzzle's constraints.
