### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog: Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic rock-paper-scissors game, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and a scoring system. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because they have two wins (paper beats rock, paper beats rock) and one loss (scissor loses to rock), resulting in a net score of `-1` (player2 wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`), so this step is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The rules for `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `result/3` are correctly defined. The recursive predicate `play/3` terminates correctly when the input lists are empty.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and scoring.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input lists for `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Undefined Moves**: If an undefined move (e.g., `spock`) is provided, the predicates `move/1` and `beats/2` will fail.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion for very long lists could impact performance, but this is unlikely in a game context.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Predicates may fail             | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Undefined moves          | Predicates may fail             | Extend `move/1` to handle edge cases. |
| 3      | Deep recursion           | Performance issues for long lists | Optimize or limit list length.      |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The implementation is correct for the given requirements, but edge cases and input validation could be improved for robustness.
