### Evaluation Report: Problog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in Prolog, intended to sort a list using the bubble sort method. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` and verifying the correctness of the implementation. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.  
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:  
  ```  
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:15.  
  ```  
- **Expected Output**: The sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.  
- **Actual Output**: Error due to unsupported syntax in ProbLog.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `bubble/3`.  
  - **Line Interval**: Lines 8–15.  
  - **Issue**: The `->/2` operator (if-then-else) is not supported in ProbLog, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario**:  
  - The logic of the `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/3` predicates is correct for classical Prolog. The `->/2` operator is valid in Prolog but not in ProbLog.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` and `bubble([], Acc, Acc)`).  

- **ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - ProbLog does not support the `->/2` operator, which is the root cause of the failure.  
  - No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used, so the report notes: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logic is correct, but syntax is incompatible with ProbLog).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined `expand/2` are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be problematic for large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `->/2` operator unsupported      | ProbLog execution fails         | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic rules if needed.  |
| 3   | No neural network integration    | No DeepProbLog features         | Use `nn/3` or `tensor/…` if required. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The `bubblesort/3` implementation is logically correct for classical Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator. To resolve this, replace the `->/2` operator with a ProbLog-compatible alternative. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in the current implementation.
