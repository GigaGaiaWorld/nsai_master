### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning, as the code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 3:15.
```

- **Failed Query**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Expected Result**: A sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.  
- **Actual Result**: Error due to an undefined operator `->` in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the `bubble/3` predicate, specifically at line 3:  
```prolog
(H1 =< H2 -> X1 = H1, X2 = H2 ; X1 = H2, X2 = H1)
```
- **Issue**: The `->/2` operator (if-then-else) is not recognized in ProbLog's syntax.  
- **Impact**: The predicate fails to execute, halting the entire sorting process.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The logical structure of the bubblesort algorithm is correct, but the use of `->/2` is problematic in ProbLog.  
  - Recursive termination is correctly implemented in `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/3`.  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning checks are required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for very large lists.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logical structure is correct, but syntax error prevents execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code assumes valid list inputs and does not handle edge cases like empty lists or non-list inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator in ProbLog | Sorting fails entirely          | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.               |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists   | Performance issues              | Optimize or limit recursion depth.  |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The bubblesort implementation is logically sound but fails due to a syntax incompatibility with ProbLog. Addressing the `->/2` operator issue and edge cases would make the code fully functional. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are involved.
