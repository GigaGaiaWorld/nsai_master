</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Problog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in Prolog, intended to sort a list using the bubble sort method. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` and verifying the correctness of the implementation. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.  
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:  
  ```  
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:15.  
  ```  
- **Expected Output**: The sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.  
- **Actual Output**: Error due to unsupported syntax in ProbLog.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `bubble/3`.  
  - **Line Interval**: Lines 8–15.  
  - **Issue**: The `->/2` operator (if-then-else) is not supported in ProbLog, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario**:  
  - The logic of the `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/3` predicates is correct for classical Prolog. The `->/2` operator is valid in Prolog but not in ProbLog.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` and `bubble([], Acc, Acc)`).  

- **ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - ProbLog does not support the `->/2` operator, which is the root cause of the failure.  
  - No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used, so the report notes: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logic is correct, but syntax is incompatible with ProbLog).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined `expand/2` are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be problematic for large lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `->/2` operator unsupported      | ProbLog execution fails         | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic rules if needed.  |
| 3   | No neural network integration    | No DeepProbLog features         | Use `nn/3` or `tensor/…` if required. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The `bubblesort/3` implementation is logically correct for classical Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator. To resolve this, replace the `->/2` operator with a ProbLog-compatible alternative. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in the current implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
