<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Evaluation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The expressions include numbers and operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The query evaluates the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, which simplifies to `0.666... + 3 - 14 = -10.333...`. However, the result `11.666...` is incorrect.
  - **Conclusion:** The test fails due to an incorrect evaluation of the arithmetic expression.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect result.
- **Expected Result:** `-10.333...`
- **Actual Result:** `11.666...`
- **Error Location:**
  - The issue lies in the `parse/2` predicates, specifically in the order of operations (operator precedence). The current implementation processes operations left-to-right without considering arithmetic precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `parse/2` predicates do not account for operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluations. For example, `2 * 7` should be evaluated before `3 - 14`, but the current implementation processes operations sequentially.
- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The recursion in `parse/2` terminates correctly when the list is reduced to a single element, but the intermediate steps are flawed due to incorrect precedence handling.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Features:**
  - **Not Used:** The code does not include any neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) or probabilistic reasoning beyond basic arithmetic.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code correctly parses and evaluates expressions but fails to handle operator precedence.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid symbols are not handled.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable for typical expressions but could be problematic for very long lists.
  - **Operator Precedence:** The most critical oversight is the lack of precedence handling.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong evaluation of expressions | Implement precedence rules in `parse/2`     |
| 2   | No input validation              | Crashes on invalid inputs       | Add checks for list structure and symbols   |
| 3   | No probabilistic features        | Limited functionality           | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed   |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires modifications to handle operator precedence and input validation. The current implementation is suitable for simple left-to-right evaluations but fails for standard arithmetic expressions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
