<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller with Error Diagnosis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within five time steps. The code includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection and wind effects, as well as deterministic rules for flap movement and goal verification.

The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the code.
- Diagnose the `UnknownClause` error encountered during testing.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error at line `33:207`. The error suggests that the ProbLog engine could not find a definition for a predicate or clause referenced in the code.

**Failed Queries:**
- `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` could not be evaluated due to the error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
The error occurs in the following section of the code:
```prolog
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
 Time > 0,
 Prev is Time-1,
 flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
 \+ goal_reached(Prev),
 use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
 actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
 wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
 goal(Target),
 Delta is Target - PrevPos,
 (Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1),
 Move is Direction * Strength + WindEffect,
 Pos is PrevPos + Move.
```
**Error Location:** Line `33:207` (likely due to a missing or undefined predicate or syntax issue).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The error suggests that the ProbLog engine encountered an undefined predicate or clause. This could be due to:
  - A missing definition for a predicate (e.g., `goal_reached/1` or `wind_effect/2`).
  - A syntax error in the clause (e.g., misplaced operators or incorrect arity).
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect/2`) are correctly defined, but the error prevents their evaluation.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are used in the code.

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Undefined Predicate:** The error may arise if `goal_reached/1` or another predicate is not defined or misspelled.
2. **Syntax Error:** The clause might contain an unrecognized operator or malformed expression.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the error prevents full evaluation.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly modeled for actuator and wind effects, but not evaluated due to the error.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-ground probabilistic clauses (e.g., `wind_effect/2`) are correctly handled.
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` error at line `33:207` | Prevents evaluation of all queries | Verify predicate definitions and syntax in the clause. |
| 2   | Potential undefined `goal_reached/1` | Logical flow disrupted | Ensure all predicates are defined or imported. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The `UnknownClause` error indicates a critical issue in the code, likely due to an undefined predicate or syntax error. Addressing this will enable the evaluation of the probabilistic and classical reasoning components. The code otherwise adheres to ProbLog's requirements but requires debugging to resolve the error.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
