### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller: Error Diagnosis and Recommendations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within five time steps. The code includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection and wind effects, as well as deterministic rules for flap movement and goal verification.

The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the code.
- Diagnose the `UnknownClause` error encountered during testing.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error at line `33:207`. The error suggests that ProbLog could not find a definition for a predicate or clause at the specified location. No query results were produced due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs during the evaluation of the model, specifically at line `33:207`.
- **Affected Predicate/Rule**: The error message does not explicitly name the predicate, but the line number points to the `attempted_flap_position` rule.
- **Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator), 
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength), 
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect), 
    goal(Target), 
    Delta is Target - PrevPos, 
    (Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1), 
    Move is Direction * Strength + WindEffect, 
    Pos is PrevPos + Move.
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The rule for `attempted_flap_position` is logically sound, but the error suggests a missing or undefined predicate or clause.
- **Probabilistic Compliance**: The probabilistic facts (`use_actuator`, `wind_effect`) are correctly defined, and their probabilities sum to 1.
- **DeepProbLog**: No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used in this code.

**Potential Issues**:
1. **Undefined Predicate**: The error may arise from an undefined predicate or a typo in the clause.
2. **Syntax Error**: The line number `33:207` suggests a parsing issue, possibly due to an unexpected character or missing delimiter.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The deterministic rules for flap movement and goal verification are correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The probabilistic rules for actuator selection and wind effects comply with ProbLog's semantics.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code does not handle cases where `wind_effect` or `use_actuator` might fail due to missing values.
  - The recursive termination condition (`goal_reached`) is correctly implemented.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` error at 33:207  | Prevents model evaluation       | Verify the syntax and ensure all predicates are defined. Check for typos.  |
| 2   | Potential undefined predicate    | Causes runtime failure          | Add missing definitions or correct predicate names.                        |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Debugging Steps**:
   - Inspect line `33` and the surrounding code for syntax errors.
   - Ensure all predicates (e.g., `use_actuator`, `wind_effect`) are correctly defined and accessible.
2. **Testing**:
   - Test individual predicates (e.g., `wind_effect(T, X)`) to verify their definitions.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Refer to ProbLog's documentation for handling undefined predicates (e.g., setting `unknown(fail)`).
