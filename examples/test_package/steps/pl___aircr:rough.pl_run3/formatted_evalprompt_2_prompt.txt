<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller: Error Diagnosis and Recommendations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within five time steps. The code includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection and wind effects, as well as deterministic rules for flap movement and goal verification.

The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the code.
- Diagnose the `UnknownClause` error encountered during testing.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error at line `33:207`. The error suggests that ProbLog could not find a definition for a predicate or clause at the specified location. No query results were produced due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs during the evaluation of the model, specifically at line `33:207`.
- **Affected Predicate/Rule**: The error message does not explicitly name the predicate, but the line number points to the `attempted_flap_position` rule.
- **Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator), 
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength), 
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect), 
    goal(Target), 
    Delta is Target - PrevPos, 
    (Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1), 
    Move is Direction * Strength + WindEffect, 
    Pos is PrevPos + Move.
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The rule for `attempted_flap_position` is logically sound, but the error suggests a missing or undefined predicate or clause.
- **Probabilistic Compliance**: The probabilistic facts (`use_actuator`, `wind_effect`) are correctly defined, and their probabilities sum to 1.
- **DeepProbLog**: No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in this code.

**Potential Issues**:
1. **Undefined Predicate**: The error may arise from an undefined predicate or a typo in the clause.
2. **Syntax Error**: The line number `33:207` suggests a parsing issue, possibly due to an unexpected character or missing delimiter.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The deterministic rules for flap movement and goal verification are correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The probabilistic rules for actuator selection and wind effects comply with ProbLog's semantics.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code does not handle cases where `wind_effect` or `use_actuator` might fail due to missing values.
  - The recursive termination condition (`goal_reached`) is correctly implemented.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` error at 33:207  | Prevents model evaluation       | Verify the syntax and ensure all predicates are defined. Check for typos.  |
| 2   | Potential undefined predicate    | Causes runtime failure          | Add missing definitions or correct predicate names.                        |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Debugging Steps**:
   - Inspect line `33` and the surrounding code for syntax errors.
   - Ensure all predicates (e.g., `use_actuator`, `wind_effect`) are correctly defined and accessible.
2. **Testing**:
   - Test individual predicates (e.g., `wind_effect(T, X)`) to verify their definitions.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Refer to ProbLog's documentation for handling undefined predicates (e.g., setting `unknown(fail)`).

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
