### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller with Error Diagnosis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within five time steps. The code includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection and wind effects, as well as deterministic rules for flap movement and goal verification.

The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the code.
- Diagnose the `UnknownClause` error encountered during testing.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error at line `33:207`. The error suggests that the ProbLog engine could not find a definition for a predicate or clause referenced in the code.

**Failed Queries:**
- `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` could not be evaluated due to the error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
The error occurs in the following section of the code:
```prolog
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
 Time > 0,
 Prev is Time-1,
 flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
 \+ goal_reached(Prev),
 use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
 actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
 wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
 goal(Target),
 Delta is Target - PrevPos,
 (Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1),
 Move is Direction * Strength + WindEffect,
 Pos is PrevPos + Move.
```
**Error Location:** Line `33:207` (likely due to a missing or undefined predicate or syntax issue).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The error suggests that the ProbLog engine encountered an undefined predicate or clause. This could be due to:
  - A missing definition for a predicate (e.g., `goal_reached/1` or `wind_effect/2`).
  - A syntax error in the clause (e.g., misplaced operators or incorrect arity).
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect/2`) are correctly defined, but the error prevents their evaluation.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are used in the code.

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Undefined Predicate:** The error may arise if `goal_reached/1` or another predicate is not defined or misspelled.
2. **Syntax Error:** The clause might contain an unrecognized operator or malformed expression.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the error prevents full evaluation.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly modeled for actuator and wind effects, but not evaluated due to the error.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-ground probabilistic clauses (e.g., `wind_effect/2`) are correctly handled.
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` error at line `33:207` | Prevents evaluation of all queries | Verify predicate definitions and syntax in the clause. |
| 2   | Potential undefined `goal_reached/1` | Logical flow disrupted | Ensure all predicates are defined or imported. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The `UnknownClause` error indicates a critical issue in the code, likely due to an undefined predicate or syntax error. Addressing this will enable the evaluation of the probabilistic and classical reasoning components. The code otherwise adheres to ProbLog's requirements but requires debugging to resolve the error.
