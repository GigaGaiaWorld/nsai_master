### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog program implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) to sort a list of integers. The goal of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical Prolog reasoning. The test case provided checks the functionality of the algorithm.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  
  The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- The predicates `insertion_sort/2`, `insertion_sort/3`, and `insert/3` are correctly defined and function as intended.  
- No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this code, so their verification is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The algorithm correctly implements insertion sort by recursively inserting each element into its proper position in the accumulator list.  
  - Base case: `insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc)` terminates the recursion.  
  - Recursive case: `insertion_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted)` ensures all elements are processed.  
  - The `insert/3` predicate handles the insertion logic, comparing elements and placing them in the correct order.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates because the list is progressively reduced (`[H|T]` becomes `T`), and the base case is reached when the list is empty.

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, confirming deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not used.** The code does not involve neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow, but this is inherent to Prolog's recursive nature.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error                  | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists | Consider iterative approaches or tail recursion optimization. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is correct for classical Prolog scenarios. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
