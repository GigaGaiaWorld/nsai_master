<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The puzzle must adhere to the following constraints:  
1. The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
2. All letters must represent distinct digits.  
3. The addition must account for carry-over operations.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])` returned a probability of `0.0000`, indicating no valid solutions were found. This suggests a failure in the code's logic or constraints.

**Failed Query:**  
- `query_sum([X6, X7, X8, X9, X10]) = 0.0000`  

**Expected Result:**  
At least one valid assignment of digits to `[A,B,C,D,E]` should satisfy the puzzle, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]` (hypothetical example).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failure occurs in the `query_sum` predicate, specifically in the constraints or the `sumdigit` calculations. The problematic code block is:  
```prolog
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
    leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C),
    all_different([A,B,C,D,E]),
    sumdigit(0, B, D, E, C1),
    sumdigit(C1, A, C, D, C2),
    sumdigit(0, B, C2, C, 0).
```

**Potential Issues:**  
1. **`sumdigit` Constraints:** The carry-over logic or digit assignments may be incorrect.  
2. **`all_different`:** The predicate might not enforce uniqueness correctly.  
3. **`leftdigit`:** The constraint on the first digit may be overly restrictive.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `sumdigit` predicate correctly models column addition with carry-over, but the constraints in `query_sum` may not align with the puzzle's requirements.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different` predicate is correctly implemented and terminates for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The result `0.0000` implies no valid assignments satisfy the constraints. This could be due to overly strict constraints or incorrect arithmetic.  
- No probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are used, so the issue lies in classical reasoning.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints or arithmetic logic is flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid digits are not handled.  
- **Performance:** The `all_different` predicate may become inefficient for larger puzzles.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| #  | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1  | No valid solutions found         | Puzzle unsolved                 | Re-examine `sumdigit` constraints   |
| 2  | `all_different` may be redundant | Unnecessary computation         | Optimize uniqueness checks          |
| 3  | No edge case handling            | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation                |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle due to logical constraints or arithmetic errors in the `query_sum` predicate. Recommendations include revisiting the `sumdigit` logic and testing with simpler cases to isolate the issue. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are involved.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
