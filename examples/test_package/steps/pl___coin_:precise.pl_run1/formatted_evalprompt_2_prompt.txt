</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code simulates a coin toss experiment using ProbLog, where a counter `CNT` decrements from 4 to 0. At each step, if the `CNT`-th coin lands heads (with a probability of 0.8), the success count `SC` increments by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an unknown clause for `if/3` at line 8. Here are the details:

- **Query:** `total(_)`
- **Expected Result:** A probabilistic distribution of the total number of successful coin tosses (e.g., `P(total(4)) = 0.4096`, `P(total(3)) = 0.4096`, etc.).
- **Actual Result:** Error: `No clauses found for 'if/3' at 8:5`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `total(_)`
- **Error Location:** Line 8, where the `if/3` predicate is used.
- **Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  if(coin(CNT), 
     (SC1 is SC + 1, coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1)), 
     coins_r(SC, S, CNT1)).
  ```
- **Issue:** The `if/3` predicate is not a built-in ProbLog or Prolog predicate, leading to the error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic is sound, but the use of `if/3` is incorrect. ProbLog does not support `if/3` as a built-in predicate.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code correctly defines `coin(C)` with a probability of 0.8, but the failure to handle conditional branching (`if/3`) disrupts the probabilistic reasoning.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

**Suggested Fix:** Replace `if/3` with ProbLog's conditional syntax or use `probabilistic_if/3` if available. Alternatively, restructure the logic using `->/2` (Prolog's conditional) or explicit probabilistic rules.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but conditional branching fails).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not fully met due to the `if/3` error.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined `if/3` predicate.
  - Non-integer or negative `CNT` values could cause issues (not handled).
  - Deep recursion performance is acceptable for small `CNT` (e.g., 4).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unknown `if/3` predicate    | Prevents execution of the query | Replace with `->/2` or ProbLog-compatible conditional logic. |
| 2   | No edge case handling       | Potential runtime errors        | Add guards for `CNT` (e.g., `CNT >= 0`).   |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**
The code's core logic is sound, but the use of an unsupported predicate (`if/3`) causes the failure. Addressing this issue and adding edge case handling will ensure robustness. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly set up but requires a valid conditional mechanism to function as intended. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
