### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**
Evaluation of Custom Stack Operations in ProbLog

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [3,1,2,4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates and rules function as intended. The `sort` operation, which sorts the top three elements of the stack, is correctly implemented using the helper predicate `get_top_n/4`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - The logical correctness of the stack operations is verified. Each operation manipulates the stack as expected, and recursive termination is ensured by the base cases in the predicates.
  - The `sort` operation uses `get_top_n/4` to extract the top three elements, sorts them, and appends them back to the stack, which is logically sound.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are applicable here.
  - The results are deterministic (probability 1.0000), indicating no probabilistic uncertainty in the current implementation.

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All stack operations behave as specified.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid stack inputs (lists). Non-list inputs or insufficient stack elements (e.g., `pop` on an empty stack) are not handled.
  - **Performance:** The `sort` operation is efficient for small stacks but may face performance issues with very large stacks due to the `append` operation.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list inputs not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for stack operations. |
| 2 | Insufficient stack elements not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for stack size before operations like `pop`, `swap`, etc. |
| 3 | DeepProbLog not utilized | Limited functionality | Consider integrating neural networks if probabilistic reasoning is required. |

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The code is logically correct and meets the specified requirements for classical stack operations. However, edge cases and input validation should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
