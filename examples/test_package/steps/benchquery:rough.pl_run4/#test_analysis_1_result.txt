### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Population Density Query

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within a 5% margin). The code includes facts for population and area but lacks the necessary predicates to calculate density and compare them. The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of the `query_pop/1` predicate.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Test Result**: Failure  
  - **Error**: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7`  
  - **Impact**: The query cannot be executed because the required predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined.  
  - **Expected**: The query should return pairs of countries with approximately equal population density.  
  - **Actual**: The query fails to execute due to missing predicate definitions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query_pop/1`  
  - **Location**: Line 59  
  - **Root Cause**: The predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined in the code.  
  - **Missing Components**:  
    1. Predicate to calculate population density (`density/2`).  
    2. Predicate to compare densities (`approximately_equal/2`).  
    3. Predicate to query and return pairs (`query_pop/1`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The code lacks the necessary logic to calculate and compare population densities.  
  - No recursive or iterative logic is present, so termination is not an issue.  
- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the current code.  
  - The error is purely syntactic (missing predicate).  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Not met. The code does not define the required predicates to perform the query.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined predicates (`density/2`, `approximately_equal/2`, `query_pop/1`).  
  - Non-list input handling is irrelevant here.  
  - No deep recursion or performance issues due to missing logic.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `query_pop/1` predicate  | Query execution fails           | Define `query_pop/1` and supporting predicates. |
| 2   | No density calculation logic     | Cannot compare densities        | Add `density(Country, Density)` predicate. |
| 3   | No comparison logic              | Cannot filter results           | Add `approximately_equal(Density1, Density2)` predicate. |

---

#### **Suggested Fix**
```prolog
% Calculate population density (population / area)
density(Country, Density) :-
    pop(Country, Pop),
    area(Country, Area),
    Density is Pop / Area.

% Check if two densities are approximately equal (within 5%)
approximately_equal(Density1, Density2) :-
    Diff is abs(Density1 - Density2),
    Threshold is 0.05 * max(Density1, Density2),
    Diff =< Threshold.

% Query pairs of countries with approximately equal density
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 @< Country2,  % Avoid duplicate pairs
    approximately_equal(Density1, Density2).
```
