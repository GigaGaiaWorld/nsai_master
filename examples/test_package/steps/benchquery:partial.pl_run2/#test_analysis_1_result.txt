### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Population Density Query in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query countries with approximately equal population density by comparing their densities using a specific formula. The code includes population and area data for various countries and defines a query predicate `query_pop/1` to identify pairs of countries meeting the density criteria. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
All test cases pass successfully. The results align with the expected output, as the density calculations and comparisons are correctly implemented.  

**Conclusion:**  
*All tests passed (no failures).*  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests pass, there are no failures to localize. However, the following predicates and rules were verified:  
- `density/2`: Correctly calculates population density.  
- `query_pop/1`: Accurately compares densities using the formula `20*D1 < 21*D2`.  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are not used in this code, so their definitions are irrelevant here.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic for calculating and comparing densities is sound. The formula ensures that the densities are approximately equal within a 5% margin.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used in this code, so termination is not a concern.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  *Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."*

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the logic for querying countries with similar population densities.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are called.  
- **Non-list Input:** The query expects a list, but no checks are in place for invalid inputs.  
- **Performance:** The code is efficient for the given dataset, but scalability for larger datasets should be tested.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The code is well-implemented and meets its functional requirements. No errors or failures were detected during testing. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation and testing with larger datasets.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.
