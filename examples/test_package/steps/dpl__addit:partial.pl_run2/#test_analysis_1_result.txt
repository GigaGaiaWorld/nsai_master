### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of facts (`digit/2`) representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0–9). It also includes a rule (`addition/3`) to perform addition on the digits represented by two images. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  - The query correctly returns the sum of the digits represented by `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6), which is 11. The probability of this result is 1.0000, indicating certainty.  
  - **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  - All predicates (`digit/2` and `addition/3`) are correctly defined and function as expected.  
  - No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this code, so their definitions are not required.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The `addition/3` rule is logically correct. It retrieves the digits associated with the input images and computes their sum.  
  - No recursion is used, so termination is not an issue.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). All facts (`digit/2`) are deterministic (probability 1.0000).  
  - The `addition/3` rule is deterministic and does not involve probabilistic implications or negations.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The `addition/3` rule performs classical arithmetic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle undefined inputs (e.g., `digit(img_x, X)` where `img_x` is not defined).  
  - No list inputs or recursive structures are involved, so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|--------------------------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No edge case handling    | Low    | Add validation for undefined `digit/2` facts. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used     | None   | Consider integrating neural networks if probabilistic reasoning is required. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Verdict**: The code is functionally correct for the given requirements, but improvements can be made for robustness and extensibility.
