#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is adjusted based on actuator strength and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to position 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure compliance with the specified requirements.
- Identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for each time step (1 to 5):

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time due to wind interference and actuator variability.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:
- `attempted_flap_position/2`: Correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength and wind effect.
- `goal_reached/1`: Properly checks if the current position matches the goal.
- `overrun_exception/1`: Accurately identifies illegal flap positions.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures no unnecessary calculations once the goal is reached.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilities of `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` and `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic for calculating flap positions and detecting exceptions is sound.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and combined.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined `expand/2`: Not used in the code.
  - Non-list input: Not relevant here.
  - Deep recursive performance: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, so performance is not an issue.
