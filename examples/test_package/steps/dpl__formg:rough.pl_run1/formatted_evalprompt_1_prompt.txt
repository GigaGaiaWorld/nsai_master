</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog (Hash: 418D2062)**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, adhering to classical logic programming principles. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior under test cases, and ensure compliance with functional requirements (interpretability, classical reasoning, and edge-case handling).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Test Query:**  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed successfully, producing the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The algorithm correctly splits the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the list is split into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)`, `P(A⇒B)`).  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in Prolog.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic elements).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).  

**Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**  
1. **Non-list Input:**  
   - The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) will fail.  
2. **Performance:**  
   - Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow (Prolog's default stack limits).  
3. **Undefined Predicates:**  
   - The `append/3` predicate is defined but not explicitly required for `merge_sort/2`.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error              | Add input validation.               |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large N | Optimize tail recursion or use iterators. |
| 3      | Unused `append/3`        | Redundant code             | Remove or document its purpose.     |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases and performance optimizations should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
