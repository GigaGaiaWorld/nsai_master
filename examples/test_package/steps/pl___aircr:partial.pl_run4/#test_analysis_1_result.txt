### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes for reaching a goal position or encountering an overrun exception. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code and its test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries are as follows:

| Query                | Probability Result |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low but non-zero.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) comply with the requirements. The following predicates were verified:
- `flap_position/2`: Correctly checks legal positions.
- `overrun_exception/1`: Triggers only for illegal positions.
- `goal_reached/1`: Depends on the `goal/1` predicate and current flap position.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`. The system correctly handles the movement logic and wind effects.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` are correctly computed. For example:
  - `P(¬legal_flap_position) = 1 - P(legal_flap_position)` is implicitly handled by the `overrun_exception` rule.
  - The probabilities for `goal_reached` decrease as the system progresses, reflecting the cumulative uncertainty.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly models the flap movement and goal conditions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for wind effects and actuator usage are correctly integrated.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The system handles illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception`) and ensures termination.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  - Performance is acceptable for the given time steps (1–5).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the test results confirm the expected behavior. No issues were identified during the evaluation.
