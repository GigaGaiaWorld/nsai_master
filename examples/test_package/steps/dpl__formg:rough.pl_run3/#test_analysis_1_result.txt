### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog (Hash: 418D2062)**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in Prolog, which sorts a list using the merge sort technique. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog reasoning.
- Check for edge cases and potential failures.
- Confirm the absence of DeepProbLog features (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly handles the provided test case.
- **Verified predicates:**
  - `merge_sort/2`: Correctly splits and merges lists.
  - `split/4`: Accurately divides the list into two halves.
  - `merge/3`: Properly merges two sorted lists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates as the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are correctly defined.
- **Recursive Termination:** The algorithm ensures termination by splitting the list into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** Not applicable here, as the implementation is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`). Report: **"DeepProbLog feature not used."**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the first clause of `merge_sort/2`.
- **Single-element List:** Handled correctly by the second clause of `merge_sort/2`.
- **Performance:** The algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), but deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used | N/A | Not applicable for this task. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, it lacks handling for non-list inputs and does not utilize DeepProbLog features. Edge cases like large lists should be tested further to ensure robustness.
