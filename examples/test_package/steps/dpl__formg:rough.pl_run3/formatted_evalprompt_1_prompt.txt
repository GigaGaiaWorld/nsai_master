</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog (Hash: 418D2062)**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in Prolog, which sorts a list using the merge sort technique. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog reasoning.
- Check for edge cases and potential failures.
- Confirm the absence of DeepProbLog features (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly handles the provided test case.
- **Verified predicates:**
  - `merge_sort/2`: Correctly splits and merges lists.
  - `split/4`: Accurately divides the list into two halves.
  - `merge/3`: Properly merges two sorted lists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates as the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are correctly defined.
- **Recursive Termination:** The algorithm ensures termination by splitting the list into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** Not applicable here, as the implementation is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: **"DeepProbLog feature not used."**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the first clause of `merge_sort/2`.
- **Single-element List:** Handled correctly by the second clause of `merge_sort/2`.
- **Performance:** The algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), but deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used | N/A | Not applicable for this task. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, it lacks handling for non-list inputs and does not utilize DeepProbLog features. Edge cases like large lists should be tested further to ensure robustness. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
</Final_Answer>
