### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is influenced by actuator strength and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4. The code includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind strength, and flap movement, along with queries to check for goal achievement and overrun exceptions.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries are as follows:

| Query                | Probability Result |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the likelihood of overrun exceptions increases slightly.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- `flap_position/2` correctly updates the flap position if it is legal.
- `overrun_exception/1` triggers when an illegal position is attempted.
- `goal_reached/1` checks if the flap has reached the goal position.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to classical Prolog rules. Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilities for `use_actuator/2`, `wind/1`, and `wind_effect/2` comply with probabilistic logic. For example:
  - `P(Â¬legal_flap_position) = 1 - P(legal_flap_position)` is implicitly handled by the `overrun_exception` rule.
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` are correctly conditioned on `wind(weak)` or `wind(strong)`.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the flap movement and exceptions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and combined.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles illegal flap positions via `overrun_exception`.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  - Recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are suggested at this time.
