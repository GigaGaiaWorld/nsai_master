<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is influenced by actuator strength and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4. The code includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind strength, and flap movement, along with queries to check for goal achievement and overrun exceptions.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries are as follows:

| Query                | Probability Result |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the likelihood of overrun exceptions increases slightly.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- `flap_position/2` correctly updates the flap position if it is legal.
- `overrun_exception/1` triggers when an illegal position is attempted.
- `goal_reached/1` checks if the flap has reached the goal position.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to classical Prolog rules. Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilities for `use_actuator/2`, `wind/1`, and `wind_effect/2` comply with probabilistic logic. For example:
  - `P(¬legal_flap_position) = 1 - P(legal_flap_position)` is implicitly handled by the `overrun_exception` rule.
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` are correctly conditioned on `wind(weak)` or `wind(strong)`.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the flap movement and exceptions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and combined.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles illegal flap positions via `overrun_exception`.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  - Recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

--- 

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are suggested at this time.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
