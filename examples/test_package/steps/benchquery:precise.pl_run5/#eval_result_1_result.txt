### Explanation:
1. **HASH A37F4273 (query_pop/1)**:
   - **ErrorSummary**: No issues found. The predicate correctly implements the logic for comparing population densities within a 5% margin using integer arithmetic.
   - **SuggestedFix**: None needed.
   - **Dependencies**: None.
   - **NeedRegenerate**: False.

2. **HASH 3A3D0149 (density/2)**:
   - **ErrorSummary**: No issues found. The predicate accurately calculates population density using floor division as specified.
   - **SuggestedFix**: None needed.
   - **Dependencies**: None.
   - **NeedRegenerate**: False.

Both modules are functionally correct and meet the requirements. No regeneration is required.
