### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) and tests their functionality. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [3,1,2,4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align perfectly with the expected behavior of each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are logically sound. Each operation manipulates the stack as described in the requirements.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `get_top_n/4` predicate ensures termination by limiting the number of elements extracted from the stack.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The provided code does not include probabilistic facts or rules. All operations are deterministic, as evidenced by the probability results (1.0000).  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations perform as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` require a non-empty stack. The code does not handle empty stacks gracefully.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The `get_top_n/4` predicate could be inefficient for very large stacks due to the use of `append/3`.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | Empty stack for certain operations | Runtime error | Handle empty stacks explicitly. |
| 3 | Inefficient `get_top_n/4` for large stacks | Performance degradation | Optimize with tail recursion or iterative methods. |

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets the specified requirements for classical stack operations. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Addressing the identified edge cases would improve its reliability.
