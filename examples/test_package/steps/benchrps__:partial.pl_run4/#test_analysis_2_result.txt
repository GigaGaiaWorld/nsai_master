### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for determining the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  `query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).`  
- **Result**:  
  `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion**:  
All tests passed (no failures). The result matches the expected outcome, where `player2` wins the game with a probability of 1.0000.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the logic adheres to the game's requirements.  

**Verified Predicates**:  
- `move/1`: Correctly defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
- `beats/2`: Correctly defines the win-lose relationships.  
- `result/3`: Accurately determines the outcome of each round (`win`, `lose`, `draw`).  
- `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Properly handle recursion and score calculation.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
- **Logical Correctness**: The rules for determining the winner (`result/3`) and computing the score (`compute_score/2`) are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
- The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. It operates purely in a deterministic context.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements**:  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game's logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

**Edge Cases**:  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input lists for `play/3`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Undefined Gestures**: The `move/1` predicate ensures only valid gestures are used.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical use cases.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**:  
The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified for the given test case.  

**Word Count**: ~350 words.  

--- 

**Final Remarks**:  
The code is well-structured and adheres to the rules of rock-paper-scissors. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic features or edge-case handling for non-list inputs.
