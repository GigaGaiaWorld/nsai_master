### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter with Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extending it with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules, and ensure all functional requirements are met.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result |  
|-------|--------|  
| `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` | `1.0000` |  
| `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` | `1.0000` |  
| `prove(expand(double(3),6))` | `1.0000` |  
| `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` | `1.0000` |  
| `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` | `1.0000` |  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

**Explanation:**  
- The `implies/2` predicate correctly verifies that if `parent(alice, bob)` holds, then `ancestor(alice, bob)` also holds.  
- The `opposite/1` predicate correctly negates the non-existent fact `parent(carol, alice)`.  
- The `expand/2` predicate successfully computes `double(3)` and matches it with `6`.  
- The `includes/2` predicate verifies that `b` is a member of the list `[a, b, c]`.  
- The `extend/3` predicate correctly prepends `3` to the list `[1, 2]` to form `[3, 1, 2]`.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates function as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `member/2` predicate is correctly implemented for list membership.  
  - The `prove/1` meta-interpreter handles compound goals (`A,B`) and negation (`\+`) correctly.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The `member/2` and `ancestor/2` predicates terminate as expected for finite lists and parent-child relationships.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**  
  - The `opposite/1` and `refute/1` predicates comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - The `implies/2` predicate complies with `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The meta-interpreter handles classical Prolog predicates and compound goals.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The predicates comply with ProbLog's probabilistic rules.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** The `expand/2` predicate is defined for `double/1` and `square/1`, but undefined cases would fail gracefully.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `includes/2` and `extend/3` predicates assume list inputs; non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The `ancestor/2` predicate could lead to performance issues for deep hierarchies.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|--------|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1 | None | None | None |  

**Conclusion:** The implementation is robust and meets all specified requirements. No errors were detected.
