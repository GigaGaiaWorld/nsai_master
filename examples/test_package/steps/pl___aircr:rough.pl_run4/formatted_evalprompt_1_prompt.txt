<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is adjusted based on actuator strength, wind effects, and a predefined goal. The system is probabilistic, accounting for uncertainties in actuator selection and wind strength. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for the first five time steps:

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.2311      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1370      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0771      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0455      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0115      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0124      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0106      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the likelihood of overrun exceptions remains low but non-zero.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:
- `attempted_flap_position/2`: Correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and the goal.
- `flap_position/2` and `overrun_exception/1`: Properly handle legal and illegal flap positions.
- Probabilistic facts (`wind/1`, `wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`): Comply with probabilistic rules.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic in `attempted_flap_position/2` correctly updates the flap position based on the previous state, actuator, and wind effect.
- **Termination:** The recursion terminates when the goal is reached or the time limit (`at(5)`) is exhausted.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind` and `wind_effect` are correctly defined and sum to 1 for each condition.
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.

##### **DeepProbLog**
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly updates the flap position and detects overrun exceptions.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for actuator selection and wind effects are correctly modeled.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this code.
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, ensuring performance is not an issue.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 450 words.

--- 

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic model accurately reflects the uncertainties in the system, and the test results confirm its correctness. No issues were identified during the evaluation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
