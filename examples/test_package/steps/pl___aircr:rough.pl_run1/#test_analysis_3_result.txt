### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is adjusted based on actuator strength, wind effects, and a predefined goal. The system is probabilistic, accounting for uncertainties in actuator selection and wind conditions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for the first five time steps. Here are the results:

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low but non-zero.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts (e.g., `use_actuator`, `wind_effect`) are properly integrated into the reasoning process.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures that the system stops attempting new positions once the goal is reached.
  - The logical correctness of the `attempted_flap_position` predicate is verified, as it correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and the goal.

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The probabilities of `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with the rules of probability theory (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled, ensuring that overrun exceptions are triggered only when the attempted position is illegal.

- **DeepProbLog:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly models the flap's movement and goal achievement.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and integrated into the reasoning process.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The system handles illegal flap positions (`legal_flap_position(FP)`) and overrun exceptions (`overrun_exception(Time)`) correctly.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  - The recursion depth is limited to the first five steps (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:** The ProbLog code for the aircraft flap controller is well-designed and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the system behaves as expected under the given constraints. No issues or failures were identified during the evaluation.
