### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, where each coin has a probability of 0.8 to land heads. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) and accumulate the results (`S`) as the counter (`CNT`) decrements to 0. The test results show the probabilities of achieving different success counts (`total(S)`). This report evaluates the correctness of the code, its adherence to probabilistic rules, and its functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `total(4) = 0.4096`  
- `total(3) = 0.4096`  
- `total(2) = 0.1536`  
- `total(1) = 0.0256`  
- `total(0) = 0.0016`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities sum to 1 (`0.4096 + 0.4096 + 0.1536 + 0.0256 + 0.0016 = 1.0`), which is correct.  
- The distribution matches the expected binomial probabilities for 4 trials with success probability 0.8.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the requirements and probabilistic expectations.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- `coin(C)` is defined with a probability of 0.8.  
- `coins_r/3` handles both success and failure cases recursively.  
- The termination condition (`CNT = 0`) is correctly implemented.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic in `coins_r/3` correctly increments `SC` for successful coin tosses and leaves it unchanged otherwise.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case (`CNT = 0`) ensures termination.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probability of `coin(C)` is correctly set to 0.8.  
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation (`\+ coin(CNT)`) adheres to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly counts successes.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed accurately.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this code.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by `CNT` (4 in this case), so performance is not an issue.
