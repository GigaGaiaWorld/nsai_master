total(0) = 0.0016
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, where each coin has a probability of 0.8 to land heads. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) and accumulate the results (`S`) as the counter (`CNT`) decrements to 0. The test results show the probabilities of achieving different success counts (`total(S)`). This report evaluates the correctness of the code, its adherence to probabilistic rules, and its functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `total(4) = 0.4096`  
- `total(3) = 0.4096`  
- `total(2) = 0.1536`  
- `total(1) = 0.0256`  
- `total(0) = 0.0016`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities sum to 1 (`0.4096 + 0.4096 + 0.1536 + 0.0256 + 0.0016 = 1.0`), which is correct.  
- The distribution matches the expected binomial probabilities for 4 trials with success probability 0.8.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the requirements and probabilistic expectations.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- `coin(C)` is defined with a probability of 0.8.  
- `coins_r/3` handles both success and failure cases recursively.  
- The termination condition (`CNT = 0`) is correctly implemented.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic in `coins_r/3` correctly increments `SC` for successful coin tosses and leaves it unchanged otherwise.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case (`CNT = 0`) ensures termination.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probability of `coin(C)` is correctly set to 0.8.  
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation (`\+ coin(CNT)`) adheres to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly counts successes.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed accurately.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this code.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by `CNT` (4 in this case), so performance is not an issue.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are needed for the given task.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

--- 

**Final Note:** The evaluation confirms the code's correctness and adherence to probabilistic rules. No further action is required.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
