</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss experiment where a counter `CNT` decrements from 4 to 0. At each step, if the `CNT`th coin (`coin(CNT)`) lands heads (with a probability of 0.8), the success count `SC` increments by 1. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The code fails with an error related to the conditional operator `->/2`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Result:** The test fails with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
  ```
- **Impact:** The program cannot execute due to an unsupported control construct in ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Error Location:** Line 8, Column 16 (conditional operator `->/2` in the `coins_r/3` predicate).
- **Code Block with Error:**
  ```prolog
  (coin(CNT) -> 
      SC1 is SC + 1,
      coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1)
  ; 
      coins_r(SC, S, CNT1)
  ).
  ```
- **Root Cause:** ProbLog does not support the Prolog `->/2` (if-then) operator.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context:**
  - The logic is correct for Prolog, but ProbLog restricts certain control constructs like `->/2`.
  - Recursive termination is ensured by `CNT > 0` and `CNT1 is CNT - 1`.

- **ProbLog Context:**
  - The error arises because ProbLog does not support `->/2`. Instead, it requires explicit disjunction (`;`) and conjunction (`,`) for conditional logic.
  - Probabilistic facts (`coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`) are correctly defined, but the conditional logic violates ProbLog's syntax.

- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but conditional handling fails).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met (probabilistic facts are correct, but conditional logic is unsupported).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes `CNT` is a positive integer. Non-integer or negative inputs would cause errors.
  - The unsupported `->/2` operator is a critical oversight.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported `->/2` operator | Program fails to execute | Replace `->/2` with explicit `(Condition, Action) ; (\+ Condition, Alternative)` logic. |
| 2 | No input validation for `CNT` | Potential runtime errors | Add guards to ensure `CNT` is a positive integer. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the conditional block with ProbLog-compatible logic:
```prolog
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    (coin(CNT), SC1 is SC + 1, coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1)
    ;
    \+ coin(CNT), coins_r(SC, S, CNT1)
).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The code fails due to the unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog. The fix involves replacing it with explicit disjunction and conjunction. The probabilistic logic is otherwise sound, but edge cases (e.g., invalid `CNT`) should be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
