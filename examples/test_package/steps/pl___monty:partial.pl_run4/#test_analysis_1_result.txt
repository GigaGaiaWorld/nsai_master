### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door, and the contestant decides whether to switch or keep their initial choice.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (each door has an equal chance of hiding the prize).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules adhere to the requirements:  
- **`open_door/1`:** Correctly handles both scenarios (randomly opening an empty door or opening the only empty door).  
- **`win_keep` and `win_switch`:** Accurately model the winning conditions for keeping or switching doors.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `member/2` and `select_door/1` are logically sound. Recursion in `member/2` terminates correctly.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles cases where doors are unselected or contain prizes without undefined behavior.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` is correctly defined.  
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+ prize(A)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration is used. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. Probabilities are computed accurately.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** Not tested, but the code assumes list inputs for `member/2`.  
- **Deep Recursion:** Not an issue due to the small problem size.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are needed for the given problem.  

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Note:** This report confirms the correctness of the ProbLog implementation for the Monty Hall problem. The code adheres to probabilistic rules and handles edge cases appropriately.
