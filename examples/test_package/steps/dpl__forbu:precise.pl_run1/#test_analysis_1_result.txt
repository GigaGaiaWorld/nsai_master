### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation with Error Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog. The goal is to recursively sort a list by swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.
- **Result**: The test failed with the error: `No clauses found for 'swap/3' at 2:2`.
- **Conclusion**: The test failed due to the absence of the `swap/3` predicate definition.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.
- **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `hole/4` predicate, which relies on the undefined `swap/3` predicate (lines 1â€“2).
- **Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
    swap(X,Y,no_swap).
  hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
    swap(X,Y,swap).
  ```
- **Impact**: The absence of `swap/3` prevents the `hole/4` predicate from functioning, halting the entire sorting process.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario**:
  - The `swap/3` predicate is critical for determining whether to swap two elements. Its absence disrupts the logical flow of the bubble sort algorithm.
  - Recursive termination is correctly implemented in `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/3`, but the missing `swap/3` prevents execution from reaching these predicates.
  
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code. The error is purely syntactic and logical.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The recursive structure is correct, but the missing `swap/3` predicate prevents full functionality.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Predicate**: The missing `swap/3` is a critical oversight.
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.
  - **Deep Recursion**: No performance issues observed, but the missing predicate prevents testing.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `swap/3` predicate  | Halts execution of `hole/4`    | Define `swap/3` to enable swapping. |
| 2   | No input validation         | Fails for non-list inputs      | Add guards for list inputs.         |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Define `swap/3` Predicate**:
   ```prolog
   swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X =< Y.
   swap(X, Y, swap) :- X > Y.
   ```
2. **Add Input Validation**:
   ```prolog
   forth_sort(L, L2) :- is_list(L), bubblesort(L, [], L2).
   ```

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The code fails due to the missing `swap/3` predicate. Addressing this and adding input validation will resolve the issues.
