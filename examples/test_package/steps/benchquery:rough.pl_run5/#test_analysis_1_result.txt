### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Population Density Query

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within a 5% margin). The code defines a `density/2` predicate to calculate the density and a `query_pop/1` predicate to find matching pairs. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following queries and their return values (all with a probability of 1.0000):  
- `query_pop([china, 244.0828402366864, france, 246.4788732394366])`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223.859649122807, pakistan, 219.2926045016077])`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219.2926045016077, indonesia, 223.859649122807])`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76.04712041884817, ethiopia, 77.71428571428571])`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477.58620689655174, philippines, 461.1111111111111])`  
- `query_pop([france, 246.4788732394366, china, 244.0828402366864])`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461.1111111111111, italy, 477.58620689655174])`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77.71428571428571, mexico, 76.04712041884817])`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the expected behavior, as the pairs of countries listed have population densities within the 5% margin.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `density/2` and `query_pop/1` are correctly defined and function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density using the formula `Density is (Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000)`.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used in this code, so termination is not an issue.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly queries and filters pairs of countries based on population density.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list of four elements. Non-list inputs or malformed lists would fail, but this is not tested here.  
- **Performance:** The code is efficient for the given dataset, but scalability for larger datasets should be tested.

**Final Remarks:**  
The code meets all specified requirements and performs as expected. No errors or failures were detected during testing. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic reasoning or neural network integration if the problem scope expands.
