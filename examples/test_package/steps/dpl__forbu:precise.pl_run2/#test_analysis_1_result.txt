### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Bubble Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to recursively sort a list by swapping adjacent elements and verifying the correctness of the implementation through test queries. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.
- **Result:** The test failed with the error: `No clauses found for 'swap/3' at 2:2`.
- **Conclusion:** The test failed due to an undefined predicate `swap/3`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.
- **Error Location:** The predicate `swap/3` is called in the `hole/4` rule (lines 1–4) but is not defined anywhere in the code.
- **Impact:** The entire sorting algorithm fails because the core swapping logic is missing.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm relies on `swap/3` to determine whether to swap adjacent elements. Since `swap/3` is undefined, the program cannot proceed.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/3` is correctly structured, but the missing `swap/3` prevents execution.
- **Probabilistic Context:** No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The sorting logic is structured correctly, but the missing `swap/3` predicate prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined `swap/3` is a critical oversight.
  - Non-list inputs or empty lists are not explicitly handled, which could lead to errors.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `swap/3` predicate | Entire sorting logic fails      | Define `swap/3` to handle swapping. |
| 2   | No edge case handling       | May fail for non-list inputs    | Add input validation.               |

---

### **Code Corrections**
To fix the issue, define the `swap/3` predicate. For example:
```prolog
swap(X, Y, swap) :- X > Y.
swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X =< Y.
```

### **Final Notes**
The implementation is logically sound but incomplete due to the missing `swap/3` predicate. Once defined, the algorithm should work as expected. Edge cases and input validation should also be addressed for robustness.
