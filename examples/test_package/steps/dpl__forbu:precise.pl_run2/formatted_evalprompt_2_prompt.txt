</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the sorting logic.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules function as intended:
- `swap/3`: Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on their values.
- `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3`: Implement the bubble sort algorithm accurately.
- `forth_sort/2`: Wraps the sorting logic and produces the correct output.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `swap/3`, `bubble/3`, and `bubblesort/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates correctly when the list is fully sorted.
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case `bubble([X], [], X)` ensures termination for single-element lists, and the recursive case processes the list incrementally.

**ProbLog Scenarios:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is involved.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The sorting logic is correct and deterministic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this implementation.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Empty List:** The predicate `bubblesort([], L, L)` handles empty lists correctly.
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to performance issues, but this is inherent to the bubble sort algorithm.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical Prolog logic. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be handled for robustness.  

**Word Count:** 350 words.  

--- 

**Code Block for Reference:**
```prolog
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
 swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
 swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):-
 hole(H1,H2,X1,X2),
 bubble([X2|T],T1,X).
bubblesort([],L,L).
bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L2, X),
    bubblesort(L2, [X | L3], Sorted).
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).

swap(X, Y, swap) :- X > Y.
swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X =< Y.
```

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
