### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the sorting logic.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules function as intended:
- `swap/3`: Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on their values.
- `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3`: Implement the bubble sort algorithm accurately.
- `forth_sort/2`: Wraps the sorting logic and produces the correct output.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `swap/3`, `bubble/3`, and `bubblesort/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates correctly when the list is fully sorted.
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case `bubble([X], [], X)` ensures termination for single-element lists, and the recursive case processes the list incrementally.

**ProbLog Scenarios:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is involved.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The sorting logic is correct and deterministic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this implementation.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Empty List:** The predicate `bubblesort([], L, L)` handles empty lists correctly.
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to performance issues, but this is inherent to the bubble sort algorithm.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical Prolog logic. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be handled for robustness.  

**Word Count:** 350 words.

**Code Block for Reference:**
```prolog
hole(X,Y,X,Y):-
 swap(X,Y,no_swap).
hole(X,Y,Y,X):-
 swap(X,Y,swap).
bubble([X],[],X).
bubble([H1,H2|T],[X1|T1],X):-
 hole(H1,H2,X1,X2),
 bubble([X2|T],T1,X).
bubblesort([],L,L).
bubblesort(L,L3,Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L2, X),
    bubblesort(L2, [X | L3], Sorted).
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).

swap(X, Y, swap) :- X > Y.
swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X =< Y.
