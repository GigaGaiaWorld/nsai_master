### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure all functional requirements are met.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.9083`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.8644`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.1248`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0109`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities derived from the given rules and probabilistic facts.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts are properly computed.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive predicates (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) correctly terminate and propagate state changes.  
- The rules for `at/3` correctly handle the robot's movement and key location updates.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds`, `drop_slippery_key`, and `retains_key` comply with the rule `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- The negation `\+ slippery(key,T)` in the `drops/2` predicate is correctly handled.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and propagated.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases like `initially_slippery(key)` and `initially_unslippery(key)` correctly.  
- Recursive predicates (e.g., `slippery/2`) terminate properly.

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. No errors or failures were detected during testing. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the classical logic is correctly implemented.
