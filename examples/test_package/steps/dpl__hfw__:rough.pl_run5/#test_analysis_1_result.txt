### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Expression Parser**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Expression Parser for Arithmetic Operations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for parsing arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The system uses predicates like `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` to map images to numbers and operators, respectively. The `expression/2` predicate combines these detections and parses the resulting list of symbols into a final arithmetic result. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the parsing logic, ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and identify potential edge cases or failures.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  The query evaluates the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, which simplifies to `0.666... + 3 - 14 = -10.333...`. However, the result `11.666...` is incorrect. This indicates a failure in the parsing logic.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:**
  The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect result.
- **Expected vs. Actual:**
  - Expected: `-10.333...`
  - Actual: `11.666...`
- **Faulty Predicate:**
  The `parse/2` predicate incorrectly processes the operator precedence. The current implementation evaluates operations left-to-right without considering standard arithmetic precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  The `parse/2` rules do not account for operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation. For example, `2 * 7` should be evaluated before `3 - 14`, but the current implementation processes operations sequentially.
- **Recursive Termination:**
  The recursion in `parse/2` terminates correctly, but the intermediate results are incorrect due to the lack of precedence handling.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`). The evaluation is purely classical.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The parsing logic is flawed due to incorrect operator precedence.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (reported as "DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs or undefined operators are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is acceptable, but the logic error overshadows this.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect operator precedence    | Incorrect arithmetic results    | Implement precedence-aware parsing (e.g., using parentheses or reordering). |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for lists.            |
| 3   | DeepProbLog features unused      | Limited functionality          | Consider integrating neural network calls if needed. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The code fails to correctly evaluate arithmetic expressions due to incorrect operator precedence handling. While the recursion and termination are logically sound, the lack of precedence rules leads to erroneous results. The evaluation highlights the need for revising the `parse/2` predicate to adhere to standard arithmetic rules. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, limiting the scope of the current implementation. Addressing these issues will ensure correctness and robustness.
