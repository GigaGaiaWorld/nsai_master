<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Expression Parser**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Expression Parser with Recursive Arithmetic Operations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse a list of symbols representing numbers and arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) into a resulting value. The code uses recursive predicates to handle the operations while respecting operator precedence (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction). The evaluation focuses on:
- Correctness of the recursive parsing logic.
- Handling of edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs, deep recursion).
- Compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided is:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:**
- The test fails with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 36:13.
  ```
- No successful queries or probability results are returned.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)`.
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `parse/2` predicate, specifically at the line where the recursive parsing is attempted. The system cannot find a clause for the `->/2` operator, indicating a syntax or predicate definition issue.
- **Code Block with Issue:**
  ```prolog
  parse([N1, Op, N2 | Rest], R) :- 
      (Op = * ; Op = /), 
      almost_equal(N1, X1), 
      almost_equal(N2, X2), 
      (Op = * -> Temp is X1 * X2 ; Temp is X1 / X2), 
      parse([Temp | Rest], R).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `parse/2` predicate is intended to handle arithmetic operations recursively, but the error suggests a problem with the conditional (`->/2`) operator. ProbLog may not support this operator directly, or it may require explicit handling.
  - The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly defined for floating-point comparisons but is not the source of the error.
- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The recursion terminates correctly when the list is reduced to a single element (`parse([N], R)`).
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`). The error is purely syntactic/logical.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The parsing logic is conceptually correct but fails due to syntactic issues.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs or malformed symbol lists are not handled.
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for very long lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `->/2` operator not recognized   | Parsing fails for all queries   | Replace `->/2` with `if-then-else` or ProbLog-compatible syntax. |
| 2   | No handling of invalid inputs    | Crashes for non-list inputs     | Add input validation predicates.            |
| 3   | No probabilistic features used   | Limited to classical reasoning  | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed.  |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix Syntax:** Replace the `->/2` operator with a ProbLog-compatible alternative (e.g., explicit `if-then-else`).
2. **Input Validation:** Add predicates to validate input lists before parsing.
3. **Edge Case Testing:** Test with edge cases (e.g., empty lists, invalid symbols).

**Word Count:** 450 words.

This report provides a clear analysis of the issues and actionable suggestions for improvement. Let me know if you'd like further details!

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
