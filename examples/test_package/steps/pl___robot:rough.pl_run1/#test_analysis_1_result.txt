### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Key Pickup Scenario**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries are as follows:
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5898`
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the probabilistic rules and logical predicates.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned probabilities consistent with the defined rules and probabilistic facts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2` and `at/3` are correctly defined. Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases and the use of `s(T)` for time steps.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as the robot failing to move (`goto_fails(T)`) or the key being slippery (`slippery(key,T)`).

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds(T)`, `drop_slippery_key(T)`, and `fumbles_key(T)` comply with the rules `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.
- **Negation:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is correctly applied, e.g., in `drops(key,T)` and `carrying(key,s(T))`.

##### **DeepProbLog**
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code. The evaluation is purely based on classical and probabilistic ProbLog.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The predicates correctly model the robot's actions and key pickup/drop scenarios.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and propagated through the rules.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are called.
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable (limited to `s(s(s(0)))`).

##### **Potential Improvements**
- **Documentation:** Add comments to clarify the probabilistic rules for better maintainability.
- **Testing:** Include more edge cases (e.g., multiple keys or locations).
