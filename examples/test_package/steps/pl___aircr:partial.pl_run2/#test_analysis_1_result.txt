### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap positioning. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while avoiding overrun exceptions. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with probabilistic reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:

- **Goal Reached:**
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **Overrun Exception:**
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- **`flap_position/2`:** Correctly updates the flap position if legal.
- **`overrun_exception/1`:** Triggers only when the attempted position is illegal.
- **`goal_reached/1`:** Accurately checks if the flap reaches the goal position.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - Logical correctness is ensured by the recursive termination condition (`Time > 0`) and the base case (`flap_position(0,6)`).
  - The predicates `legal_flap_position/1` and `goal/1` are correctly defined and used.

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The probabilities of `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with the rules of probability theory (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - The computation of `attempted_flap_position/2` correctly combines actuator strength and wind effects.

- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The system correctly models the flap movement and goal conditions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities are correctly computed and propagated.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The system handles illegal flap positions gracefully by triggering `overrun_exception/1`.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  - Recursive performance is efficient due to the limited time steps (`at(5)`).

**Final Remarks:** The ProbLog code for the aircraft flap controller is well-designed and meets all specified requirements. The test results confirm its correctness and robustness. No further modifications are necessary.
