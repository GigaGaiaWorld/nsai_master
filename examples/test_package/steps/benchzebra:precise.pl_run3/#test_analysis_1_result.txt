### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, predicate definitions, and error handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails during execution with the following error:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the predicate `member/2` is not defined in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Location:** Line 4 of the provided code.
- **Issue:** The predicate `member/2` is used but not defined in the ProbLog program. The error indicates that ProbLog cannot find any clauses for `member/2`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The puzzle's constraints are logically sound, but the implementation lacks the necessary predicate definitions.
- **Recursive Termination:** Not applicable here since the error occurs before any recursion is attempted.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The undefined `member/2` predicate is a critical oversight.
  - Input validation (e.g., ensuring `Houses` is a list) is not addressed.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Execution fails immediately      | Define `member/2` or use built-in predicates. |
| 2      | No input validation         | Potential runtime errors         | Add checks for list inputs.         |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fixes**
1. **Define `member/2`:**
   ```prolog
   member(X, [X|_]).
   member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
   ```
2. **Use Built-in Predicates:**
   Replace `member/2` with ProbLog's built-in list handling predicates if available.

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The Zebra Puzzle implementation is logically sound but fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Addressing this issue and ensuring proper input validation will resolve the errors. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are involved in this implementation.
