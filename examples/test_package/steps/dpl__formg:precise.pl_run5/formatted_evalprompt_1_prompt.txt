<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to requirements, and ensure it handles edge cases and probabilistic scenarios appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Length Check:** The `length(List, Len)` predicate ensures recursive boundary conditions are met.  
2. **Splitting:** The `split_list/3` predicate correctly divides the list into two sublists.  
3. **Recursive Sorting and Merging:** The recursive calls to `merge_sort/2` and `merge/3` function as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation correctly follows the merge sort algorithm:  
  - Base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are handled.  
  - Recursive splitting and merging are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as the list is split until its length is ≤ 1.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not use neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement | Status | Explanation |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Classical Reasoning | Met | Correctly implements merge sort. |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts/rules used. |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Applicable | No DeepProbLog features used. |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion could be inefficient for very large lists, but this is inherent to the algorithm.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | No probabilistic features used | Limited to classical Prolog | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural network support | Incorporate `nn/3` for hybrid reasoning. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is correct for classical Prolog scenarios and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks features for probabilistic reasoning and neural network integration, limiting its applicability in advanced ProbLog use cases. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.  

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
