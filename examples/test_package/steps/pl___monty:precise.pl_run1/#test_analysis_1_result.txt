### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The ProbLog code provided models this scenario, including the probabilistic selection of doors and the host's behavior. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation and its adherence to probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities:  
- The prize is equally likely behind any door (`1/3` for each).  
- The contestant's initial selection is fixed (`select_door(1)`).  
- The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice is `1/3`, while switching yields `2/3`.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- The `open_door` rules correctly handle the host's behavior when one or two doors are available to open.  
- The `win_keep` and `win_switch` predicates accurately reflect the contestant's outcomes.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- Logical correctness is ensured by the recursive `member/2` predicate and the constraints (`\+ prize(A)`, `\+ select_door(A)`).  
- Recursive termination is guaranteed as `member/2` operates on finite lists (`[1,2,3]`).  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities comply with the rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled by negation-as-failure (`\+ prize(A)`).  
  - The host's choice (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`) ensures fairness when two doors are available.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules correctly model the host's behavior and contestant choices.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with the Monty Hall problem's theoretical outcomes.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `select_door(1)` is fixed). Non-list inputs or undefined predicates are not handled but are irrelevant here.  
- Performance is not an issue due to the small problem size.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:**  
The ProbLog implementation accurately models the Monty Hall problem, with no logical or probabilistic errors. The test results confirm the expected outcomes, and the code adheres to best practices for classical and probabilistic reasoning. No DeepProbLog features are used.
