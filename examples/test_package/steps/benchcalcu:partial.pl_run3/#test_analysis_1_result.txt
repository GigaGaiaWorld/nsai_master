#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Cryptoaddition Code: Functional and Logical Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The code enforces constraints such as unique digits, non-zero leading digits, and correct column-wise addition with carry propagation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each query returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the constraints and logic of the code are correctly implemented.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures non-zero leading digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures all digits are unique.  

All predicates adhere to their intended functionality.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code enforces all constraints (non-zero digits, unique digits, correct addition) without logical errors.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different/1` predicate terminates correctly for lists of finite length.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (0-9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The `all_different/1` predicate may become inefficient for larger lists due to its recursive nature.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Explanation:** No errors were found. The code meets all specified requirements and passes all test cases.

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code is well-structured and correctly implements the cryptoaddition logic. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic constraints or DeepProbLog features if needed.
