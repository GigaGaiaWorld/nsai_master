</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit List Conversion and Addition**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a predicate `number/2` to convert a list of image IDs (e.g., `[img_7, img_9]`) into their corresponding integer values (e.g., `79`). Additionally, a predicate `multi_addition/3` performs addition on two such lists. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze edge cases, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], 391) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  - The expected result of `79 + 312 = 391` matches the actual output.  
  - **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`), so this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `number/2` predicate correctly handles recursion and base cases.  
  - The `multi_addition/3` predicate accurately converts lists to integers and performs addition.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion in `number/2` terminates when the input list is empty (`[]`).  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  
- **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements list-to-integer conversion and addition.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid image IDs. Non-list inputs or invalid IDs would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very long lists due to recursive calls.  
- **Undefined `digit/2` Facts**: Missing `digit/2` facts for some image IDs would lead to failures.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling     | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation checks.        |
| 2      | Deep recursion performance  | Slow execution for large lists  | Consider iterative implementation. |
| 3      | Missing `digit/2` facts     | Incomplete functionality        | Ensure all required facts are defined. |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning but lacks robustness for edge cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
