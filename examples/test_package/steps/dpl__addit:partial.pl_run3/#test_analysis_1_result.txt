### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of facts (`digit/2`) representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0–9). It also includes a rule (`addition/3`) for adding two digits and a query to test this logic. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  - The query correctly computes the sum of the digits corresponding to `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6), yielding 11 with a probability of 1.0000.  
  - **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  - The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The `addition/3` rule is logically correct. It retrieves the digits associated with the input images and computes their sum.  
  - No recursion is used, so termination is not a concern.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code uses deterministic facts (`digit/2`), so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` are not applicable here.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The `addition/3` rule correctly performs classical arithmetic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (only deterministic facts are used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle undefined inputs (e.g., non-existent images).  
  - No recursive performance issues (no recursion used).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | No edge case handling       | May fail for invalid input | Add input validation checks.        |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used        | Limited functionality      | Consider integrating neural models. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The provided ProbLog code is functionally correct for the given test case. However, it lacks edge case handling and does not utilize DeepProbLog features. Enhancements could include input validation and integration of probabilistic or neural network components for more advanced use cases.
