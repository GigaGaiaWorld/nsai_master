/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. The original code uses a single recursive clause with disjunction (;) to handle both coin success and failure cases, while the generated code separates these into two distinct recursive clauses. This structural change does not affect the logic or the outcome, as evidenced by the identical run results. Both versions correctly model the probabilistic counting of coin flips with a success probability of 0.8.
