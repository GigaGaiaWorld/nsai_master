0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error in the 'between/3' predicate call. The original code correctly uses 'Max is N-1' before calling 'between(1,Max,I)', while the generated code attempts to directly use 'N-1' as an argument, which is not allowed in Problog's 'between/3' predicate. This causes a CallModeError. The logic of the generated code is otherwise consistent with the original, but this syntax error prevents it from running correctly.
