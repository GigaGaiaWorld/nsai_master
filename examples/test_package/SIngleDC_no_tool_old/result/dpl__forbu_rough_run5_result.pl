/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm but contains several issues. It uses a cut operator (!) which is not recognized in the Problog environment, leading to a runtime error. The original code successfully sorts the list using a different approach with swap predicates, while the generated code fails to execute due to syntax incompatibility. The generated code's structure differs significantly from the original, particularly in how it handles list manipulation and sorting logic.
