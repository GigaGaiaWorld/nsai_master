/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the use of a non-ground probabilistic clause 'coin(C)' which causes an error during evaluation. The original code correctly uses 'coin(CNT)' within a disjunction to count successful coin flips, while the generated code attempts to use a variable 'C' that is not properly instantiated. This leads to a runtime error, making the generated code invalid.
