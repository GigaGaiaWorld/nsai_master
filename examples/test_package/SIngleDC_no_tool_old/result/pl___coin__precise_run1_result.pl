/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct due to the use of '->' operator, which is not valid in Problog syntax. The original code uses a disjunction (;) to handle probabilistic choices, which is the correct approach in Problog. The generated code fails to run because Problog does not recognize the '->' operator, leading to a syntax error. The original code correctly models the probabilistic scenario and produces the expected results.
