% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a subtle difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'pick(I+1, b)' directly instead of storing I+1 in a variable first. This change does not affect the logical correctness but might impact readability. The main issue is with the running results: the original code yields bb(5) = 0.3750 while the generated code yields bb(5) = 0.6484, indicating a significant discrepancy in the probabilistic outcomes. This suggests that the generated code does not produce the same results as the original, likely due to the modification in the 'bb' predicate.
