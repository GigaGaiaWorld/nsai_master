Check if the goal has been reached:\n If Old already satisfies goal(Old), no new trial position is calculated.\n \n 2.Determine the current actuator and its strength:\n Select actuator A (use_actuator) according to time Time, and get its thrust AS from actuator_strength(A).\n \n 3. Calculate the direction and contribution of the actuator\n Take the global target position GP (goal(GP)), and compare the difference direction between GP and Old:\n - If the target is in front of the current direction, AE = +AS; if in the opposite direction, AE = −AS;\n - Specific calculation: AE = sign(GP − Old) × AS.\n \n 4. Superimpose wind interference:\n Take the additional effect WE of the wind force on the position at that moment from wind_effect(Time).\n \n Combine the trial position of this step:\n Add the three parts and get the current attempt flapping position Pos.",
