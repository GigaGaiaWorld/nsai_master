  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the original code by replacing the disjunction with an if-then-else construct (->/2). However, this change introduces a syntax error in Problog, as the '->/2' operator is not correctly used in this context. The original code uses a disjunction (;) to handle both cases of the coin flip, which is the correct approach in Problog. The generated code fails to execute due to this syntax error, making it invalid."
