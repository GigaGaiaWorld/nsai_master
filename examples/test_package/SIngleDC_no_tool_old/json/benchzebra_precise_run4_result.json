  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but contains a critical error. The predicate 'member/2' is used instead of 'my_member/2', which leads to a runtime error since 'member/2' is not defined. Additionally, 'snail' is used instead of 'snails' in one of the member clauses. These issues make the generated code invalid and prevent it from producing the expected result."
