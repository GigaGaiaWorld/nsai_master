  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it introduces a syntax error in the 'determine_winner' predicate by using '->' operator incorrectly, which leads to a runtime error. The original code uses a disjunction (;) for conditional checks, which is correct. The generated code fails to execute due to this syntax issue, making it invalid."
