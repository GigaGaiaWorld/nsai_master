  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm in Prolog, with identical logic for splitting, merging, and sorting lists. The only difference is the renaming of the predicate 'split_list' to 'split' in the generated code, which does not affect the behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, producing the same sorted list."
