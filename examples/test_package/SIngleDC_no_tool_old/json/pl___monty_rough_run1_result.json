  "final_report": "The generated code simplifies the original code by changing the way doors are opened. Instead of probabilistic selection between two non-prize, non-selected doors, it deterministically picks the first available non-prize, non-selected door. Despite this change in implementation, the core logic remains consistent with the Monty Hall problem, and the results match the original probabilities for both keeping and switching choices."
