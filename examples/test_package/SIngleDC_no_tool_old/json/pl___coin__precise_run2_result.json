  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the original code by replacing the disjunction with an if-then-else construct (->/2). However, this change introduces a syntax error because Prolog/Problog does not support the ->/2 operator in this context without proper parentheses or in a way that matches its expected usage. The original code correctly uses a disjunction (;)/2 to handle the probabilistic choice, which is essential for Problog's probabilistic reasoning. The generated code fails to execute due to this syntax error, making it invalid for the intended probabilistic computation."
