  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error. The predicate 'member/2' is used instead of 'my_member/2', which is not defined in the code. This inconsistency causes the program to fail with an 'UnknownClause' error. The original code correctly uses 'my_member/2' throughout. Additionally, there is a typo in 'snail' instead of 'snails' in the generated code. These issues prevent the generated code from running successfully and producing the expected result."
