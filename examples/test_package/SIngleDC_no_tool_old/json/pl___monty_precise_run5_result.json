  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes of keeping or switching doors. The generated code introduces a 'Selected' variable in the open_door rules, which does not affect the logic or results. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
