  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog. The generated code renames the 'insert_element' predicate to 'insert', but the logic remains unchanged. The running results of both codes are identical, sorting the list [3,1,2,5,7,12] into [1,2,3,5,7,12] with a probability of 1.0000. No problems were identified in the generated code."
