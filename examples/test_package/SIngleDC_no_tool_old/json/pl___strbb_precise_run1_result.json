  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a significant difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'pick(I+1, b)' directly instead of calculating 'II is I+1' first. This change affects the probability calculation, leading to a different result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is syntactically valid but produces a different outcome due to this modification."
