  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect compared to the original code. It only includes one constraint (my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses) and misses all other constraints present in the original code. The generated code's result shows multiple possible solutions with many unbound variables, which is inconsistent with the original code's single, fully-bound solution. The generated code fails to meet the requirements of the original problem."
