  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause error, which occurs because the variable 'C' in 'coin(C)' is not properly instantiated before being used in a probabilistic context. This makes the generated code invalid. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic choice by using 'coin(CNT)' which is properly instantiated. The running results of the two pieces of code are inconsistent due to this error."
