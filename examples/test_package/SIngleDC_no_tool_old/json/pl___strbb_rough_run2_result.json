  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error in the 'between' predicate call. The original code correctly uses 'Max is N-1' before calling 'between(1,Max,I)', while the generated code attempts to call 'between(1, N-1, I)' directly, which causes a CallModeError because 'N-1' is not evaluated before the call. This inconsistency makes the generated code invalid. The running results cannot be compared because the generated code fails to execute."
