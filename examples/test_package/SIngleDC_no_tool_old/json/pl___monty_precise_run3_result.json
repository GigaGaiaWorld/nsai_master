  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It correctly implements the Monty Hall problem, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes (win_keep and win_switch). The modifications in the generated code, such as adding 'select_door(Selected)' in the open_door rules, do not affect the logic or results. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their consistency."
