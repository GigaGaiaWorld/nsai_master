  "final_report": "The generated code modifies the original 'bb' predicate by adding conditions for N=0 and N=1, which were not present in the original. This change affects the probability calculation, leading to a different result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is syntactically correct but semantically inconsistent with the original, as it alters the logic and resulting probabilities."
