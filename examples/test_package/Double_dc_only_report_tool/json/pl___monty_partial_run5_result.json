  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem accurately, with the same probability distributions for prize selection, door opening, and winning conditions. The generated code simplifies some conditions but maintains logical equivalence. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their consistency."
