  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor difference: 'snails' in the original code was changed to 'snail' in the generated code. This change does not affect the overall logic or the solution to the zebra puzzle. The generated code maintains all the constraints and relationships specified in the original code, and the running results are effectively identical, solving the puzzle correctly."
