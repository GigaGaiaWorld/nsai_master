  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause by using 'coin(C)' without properly grounding the variable C, which leads to an error during execution. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic choice by using 'coin(CNT)' which is properly grounded. The generated code also incorrectly assumes a heads/tails outcome check which wasn't present in the original. This makes the generated code both syntactically invalid and semantically different from the original."
