  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips over 4 trials with a success probability of 0.8, resulting in a binomial distribution. The generated code incorrectly hardcodes the coin flip to always use 'c1' and does not properly handle the probabilistic nature of the original code. This leads to incorrect results where all outcomes have the same probability (0.8), which is not the expected behavior."
