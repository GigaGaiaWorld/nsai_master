  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues compared to the original code. First, there are syntax errors such as incorrect indentation and misplaced predicates. Second, some predicates have incorrect argument orders, like 'house(norwegian, _, _, _, _)' instead of 'house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)'. Third, 'snail' is used instead of 'snails', which is a typo. These errors cause the generated code to fail, resulting in a 0.0000 probability output, unlike the original code which correctly solves the zebra puzzle."
