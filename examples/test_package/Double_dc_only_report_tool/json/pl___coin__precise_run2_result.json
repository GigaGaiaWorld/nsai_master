  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code. It maintains the same logic for counting successful coin flips and produces identical results. The only difference is the use of a new variable 'NSC' instead of 'SC2' in the recursive step, which does not affect the functionality or outcome. Both codes correctly calculate the probabilities for the total number of successful coin flips out of 4 attempts with a success probability of 0.8 per flip."
