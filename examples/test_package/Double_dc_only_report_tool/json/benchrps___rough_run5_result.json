  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the original code by combining the result calculation into a single predicate 'play_round' using conditional statements. However, it introduces a syntax error with the '->' operator, which is not properly formatted in Prolog. The original code correctly separates the result calculation into distinct clauses for clarity and correctness. The generated code fails to run due to this syntax error, while the original code produces the correct result (player2 wins)."
