  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, producing the same results as the original code. It simplifies the door-opening mechanism by using findall to identify non-prize, non-selected doors, which is more concise but equally effective. Both codes maintain the same probability distributions for prize selection, door selection, and winning outcomes (keep vs switch)."
