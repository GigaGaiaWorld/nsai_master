    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'c1/0' at 9:6.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a coin `CNT` times and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final result should be the total number of heads (`S`) after `CNT` tosses. The code uses recursive logic to achieve this. However, the test results indicate an error related to the predicate `c1/0`. This report evaluates the code's correctness, identifies failures, and provides suggestions for improvement.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(S)`  
  - **Expected Result:** A probabilistic distribution of the total number of heads after 4 coin tosses.  
  - **Actual Result:** Error: `No clauses found for 'c1/0' at 9:6`.  
  - **Conclusion:** The test failed due to an undefined predicate `c1/0`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(S)`  
  - **Error Location:** Line 9, Column 6 in the code block.  
  - **Problematic Predicate:** `c1/0` is called but not defined.  
  - **Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
        CNT > 0,
        coin(c1),  % Error: 'c1/0' is undefined.
        (c1, NSC is SC + 1 ; \+ c1, NSC is SC),
        NCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NSC, S, NCNT).
    ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic (`coins_r/3`) is correctly structured to terminate when `CNT` reaches 0.  
  - The issue arises from the undefined predicate `c1/0`, which is used to simulate a coin toss but lacks a definition.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The code attempts to use `coin(c1)` to represent a probabilistic fact (e.g., a biased coin with `P(heads) = 0.8`). However, `c1/0` is not defined as a probabilistic fact or rule.  
  - The negation `\+ c1` is also problematic because `c1/0` is undefined.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not Used:** The code does not utilize any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The recursive logic is correct, but the undefined predicate `c1/0` prevents execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the undefined `c1/0`.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** The code fails to define `c1/0`, which is critical for the simulation.  
  - **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable (`CNT=4`), but undefined predicates halt execution before performance becomes an issue.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| **No.** | **Problem**               | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                          |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1       | Undefined predicate `c1/0` | Code fails to execute               | Define `c1` as a probabilistic fact (e.g., `c1::0.8`). |
| 2       | Negation of undefined `c1` | Logical inconsistency               | Ensure `c1` is defined before using `\+ c1`. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**  
1. **Define `c1` as a Probabilistic Fact:**  
   ```prolog
   c1::0.8.  % Probability of heads is 0.8.
   ```
2. **Revise the `coin/1` Predicate:**  
   Ensure it correctly references the probabilistic fact:  
   ```prolog
   coin(C) :- C::0.8.  % Replace `make_coin` with direct probabilistic fact.
   ```
3. **Test the Revised Code:**  
   After corrections, the query `total(S)` should return a valid probabilistic distribution of heads.

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

This report highlights the critical error in the code and provides actionable steps to resolve it. The analysis ensures the code meets its functional requirements while adhering to ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
