---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Code in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition problem where the sum of two numbers (`AB + BCD = CDE`) is computed under the constraints that:
- All digits are unique.
- The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be zero.
- The addition is performed column-wise with carry propagation.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
1. Verify the correctness of the code based on the provided test results.
2. Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the implementation.
3. Identify potential edge cases or overlooked scenarios.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided are as follows:
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each query returns a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the constraints and logic are correctly implemented.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the constraints (e.g., `leftdigit`, `all_different`, and `sumdigit`) are functioning as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `sumdigit` predicate correctly handles column-wise addition and carry propagation.
  - The `all_different` predicate ensures uniqueness of digits.
  - The `leftdigit` predicate enforces the non-zero constraint for the first digit.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)`). It is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition problem using deterministic logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases such as:
    - Non-zero first digits.
    - Unique digits across all variables.
    - Carry propagation in multi-digit addition.
  - Potential overlooked cases:
    - Input validation (e.g., non-list inputs) is not explicitly handled.
    - Performance for very large digit sets (e.g., recursive calls in `all_different`).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is logically correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors or failures were detected in the provided test cases. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation and performance optimizations for larger digit sets.
