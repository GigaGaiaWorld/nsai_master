### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin multiple times and count the number of heads (`S`) after `CNT` tosses. The code uses recursive logic to accumulate the results. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic behavior, and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Result:** The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```  
  This indicates that the probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is not properly grounded.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate:** `PH::make_coin(C,PH)`  
  - **Line Number:** 1  
- **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground, meaning the variable `C` is uninstantiated when the probabilistic fact is evaluated. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be grounded (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for counting heads, but the probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is not grounded.  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT` reaches 0.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The error arises because the probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is not grounded. ProbLog cannot evaluate non-ground probabilistic facts.  
  - **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:** The code does not violate any probabilistic rules, but the grounding issue prevents evaluation.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but grounding issue exists).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic fact.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-Ground Probabilistic Facts:** The primary issue.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** Not a problem here due to small `CNT` (4).  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** None observed.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic fact    | Prevents evaluation            | Ground the variable `C` in `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` (e.g., `PH::make_coin(heads,PH)`). |
| 2      | Recursive logic untested         | Potential hidden bugs          | Test with larger `CNT` values once grounding is fixed. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic fact, which is a critical issue in ProbLog. Fixing this by grounding the variable `C` will allow the code to execute as intended. The recursive logic appears correct but should be tested further once the grounding issue is resolved. No DeepProbLog features are used in this code.
