### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Simulating Coin Tosses**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`P(heads) = 0.8`) a specified number of times (`CNT`) and accumulate the total number of heads (`S`). The code uses recursion to achieve this. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Result:** The test failed with the error:
  ```
  NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```
- **Interpretation:** The error indicates that the probabilistic clause `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground, which violates ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground (i.e., fully instantiated).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Error Location:** 
  - **Predicate:** `PH::make_coin(C,PH)`
  - **Line Number:** 1
- **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground because `C` is a variable. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be ground (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical reasoning, but the non-ground probabilistic fact prevents execution.
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the decrement of `CNT` until it reaches 0.
- **Probabilistic Scenario:**
  - The error arises because the probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is not ground. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be fully instantiated (e.g., `0.8::make_coin(heads)`).
  - The negation and implication rules are not directly relevant here, but the error prevents any probabilistic reasoning from occurring.
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but execution is blocked by the probabilistic error).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic fact.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The non-ground probabilistic fact is a critical oversight.
  - The recursive depth is controlled by `CNT`, so performance is not an issue for small values.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground probabilistic fact    | Prevents execution of the query | Replace `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` with `0.8::make_coin(heads)` and `0.2::make_coin(tails)`. |
| 2   | Missing base case for `coin/1`   | Logical incompleteness          | Add `coin(tails) :- make_coin(tails, 0.2).` to cover all outcomes. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**
```problog
0.8::make_coin(heads).
0.2::make_coin(tails).
coin(heads) :- make_coin(heads).
coin(tails) :- make_coin(tails).

coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(C),
    (C = heads -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC),
    NCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC, S, NCNT).

total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The original code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic fact, which violates ProbLog's requirements. The corrected version ensures ground probabilistic facts and includes all necessary outcomes. The recursive logic is sound, and the probabilistic reasoning is now compliant with ProbLog's rules. No DeepProbLog features are used.
