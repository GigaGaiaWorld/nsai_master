### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final output should be the total number of heads (`S`) after all tosses. The code uses recursion to achieve this. However, the test results indicate an error related to non-ground probabilistic clauses.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Result:** 
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```
- **Conclusion:** The test failed due to a non-ground probabilistic clause in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Error Location:** 
  - Line 1: `PH::make_coin(C,PH).`
  - The error occurs because `PH` is not instantiated (non-ground) when used in the probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)`.
- **Impact:** The probabilistic fact cannot be evaluated, causing the entire query to fail.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical reasoning. It terminates when `CNT` reaches 0.
  - However, the probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground, violating ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground (fully instantiated).
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**
  - The error indicates a violation of ProbLog's probabilistic rules. Probabilistic facts must be ground to compute probabilities correctly.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** 
  - Not used in this code. No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the probabilistic fact is invalid).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic clause.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-ground probabilistic facts are a critical edge case overlooked in the code.
  - Recursive performance is acceptable for small `CNT` but could be problematic for large values due to stack usage.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | Query fails to evaluate         | Instantiate `PH` (e.g., `0.8::make_coin(C,0.8)`). |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features used     | N/A                             | Not applicable for this code.               |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix the Probabilistic Fact:**
   Replace `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` with a ground fact, e.g., `0.8::make_coin(C,0.8)`.
2. **Test the Corrected Code:**
   Verify the corrected code with the query `query(total(_))` to ensure it returns the expected probabilistic results.
3. **Edge Case Testing:**
   Test with edge cases like `CNT = 0` or very large `CNT` to ensure robustness.
