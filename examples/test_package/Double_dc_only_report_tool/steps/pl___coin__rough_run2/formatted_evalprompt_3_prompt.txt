    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Simulating Coin Tosses**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`P(heads) = 0.8`) a specified number of times (`CNT`) and accumulate the total number of heads (`S`). The code uses recursion to achieve this. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Result:** The test failed with the error:
  ```
  NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```
- **Interpretation:** The error indicates that the probabilistic clause `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground, which violates ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground (i.e., fully instantiated).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Error Location:** 
  - **Predicate:** `PH::make_coin(C,PH)`
  - **Line Number:** 1
- **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground because `C` is a variable. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be ground (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical reasoning, but the non-ground probabilistic fact prevents execution.
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the decrement of `CNT` until it reaches 0.
- **Probabilistic Scenario:**
  - The error arises because the probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is not ground. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be fully instantiated (e.g., `0.8::make_coin(heads)`).
  - The negation and implication rules are not directly relevant here, but the error prevents any probabilistic reasoning from occurring.
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but execution is blocked by the probabilistic error).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic fact.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The non-ground probabilistic fact is a critical oversight.
  - The recursive depth is controlled by `CNT`, so performance is not an issue for small values.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground probabilistic fact    | Prevents execution of the query | Replace `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` with `0.8::make_coin(heads)` and `0.2::make_coin(tails)`. |
| 2   | Missing base case for `coin/1`   | Logical incompleteness          | Add `coin(tails) :- make_coin(tails, 0.2).` to cover all outcomes. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**
```problog
0.8::make_coin(heads).
0.2::make_coin(tails).
coin(heads) :- make_coin(heads).
coin(tails) :- make_coin(tails).

coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(C),
    (C = heads -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC),
    NCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC, S, NCNT).

total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The original code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic fact, which violates ProbLog's requirements. The corrected version ensures ground probabilistic facts and includes all necessary outcomes. The recursive logic is sound, and the probabilistic reasoning is now compliant with ProbLog's rules. No DeepProbLog features are used. 

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
