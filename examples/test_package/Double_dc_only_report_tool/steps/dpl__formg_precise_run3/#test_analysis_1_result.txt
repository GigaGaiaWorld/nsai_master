### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with the specified requirements.
- Analyze edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`
- **Result**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`
- **Conclusion**: The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The implementation correctly sorts the input list and adheres to the specified requirements.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation meets all functional requirements:
1. **Length Calculation and Boundary Check**: The `length(List, Len)` and `Len > 1` conditions ensure recursive splitting only occurs for lists longer than one element.
2. **List Splitting**: The `split_list/3` predicate correctly divides the list into two halves (`Left` and `Right`).
3. **Recursive Sorting and Merging**: The recursive calls to `merge_sort/2` and the `merge/3` predicate work as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Context**:
  - **Logical Correctness**: The predicates (`merge_sort/2`, `split_list/3`, `merge/3`) are logically sound. The recursion terminates correctly for base cases (`[]` and `[X]`).
  - **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates when the list length is â‰¤ 1, ensuring no infinite loops.

- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation.
  - **DeepProbLog Features**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog predicates.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Empty List**: Handled by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.
  - **Single-Element List**: Handled by the base case `merge_sort([X], [X])`.
  - **Non-List Input**: Not explicitly handled. The code assumes input is a list.
  - **Performance**: The implementation is efficient for typical use cases, but deep recursion could be a concern for very large lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The merge sort implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No failures were detected in the provided test case. The code is robust for typical use cases but could benefit from additional edge-case handling (e.g., non-list inputs). No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features were used.
