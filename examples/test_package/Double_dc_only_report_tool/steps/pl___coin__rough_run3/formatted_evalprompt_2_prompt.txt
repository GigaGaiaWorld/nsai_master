    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Simulating Coin Tosses**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a coin `CNT` times and accumulating the number of heads (`SC`) to compute the total number of heads (`S`). The code includes probabilistic facts (`coin/1`) and recursive rules (`coins_r/3`). The evaluation focuses on verifying logical correctness, probabilistic compliance, and edge-case handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Result:** The test failed with the error:
  ```
  NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```
  This indicates that the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not properly grounded, leading to evaluation failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Error Location:** 
  - **Predicate:** `coin(C)`
  - **Line:** The probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is non-ground (variable `C` is uninstantiated).
- **Expected Behavior:** The probabilistic fact should be grounded (e.g., `coin(head)` or `coin(tail)`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The recursive rule `coins_r/3` is logically correct but fails due to the non-ground probabilistic fact.
  - Termination is ensured by decrementing `CNT` until it reaches 0.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**
  - The error violates ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be ground (e.g., `coin(head)::0.8`).
  - The negation/implication rules are not applicable here, as the issue is syntactic.
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but execution fails).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (non-ground probabilistic fact).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-ground probabilistic facts are overlooked.
  - Recursive performance is acceptable, but the base case (`CNT = 0`) is correct.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground probabilistic fact    | Code fails to execute          | Replace `coin(C)` with `coin(head)` or `coin(tail)` and ensure grounding. |
| 2   | Missing probabilistic annotation | Probabilities not applied      | Annotate `coin(head)::0.8` and `coin(tail)::0.2`. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**
```problog
% Probabilistic facts
0.8::coin(head).
0.2::coin(tail).

% Recursive rule
coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(C),
    (C = head -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC = SC),
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT).

% Query
total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The original code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic fact. After grounding and annotating the probabilistic facts, the code should execute correctly, meeting the functional requirements. Edge cases like non-ground facts must be addressed to ensure robustness. 

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
