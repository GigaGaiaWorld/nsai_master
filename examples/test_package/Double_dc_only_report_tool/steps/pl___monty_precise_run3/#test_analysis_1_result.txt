### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the problem's requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door, and the contestant decides whether to switch or stay.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- All probabilities are correct. The prize is equally likely behind any door (`1/3`).  
- `win_keep` (probability of winning by staying) is `1/3`, and `win_switch` (probability of winning by switching) is `2/3`, as expected.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The code adheres to the problem's requirements:  
- The host opens a door that is neither selected nor hides the prize.  
- The host's choice is random when two doors are available (`0.5` probability for each).  
- The rules for opening doors (`open_door/1`) are correctly implemented.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Logical Correctness:**  
- The rules for `open_door/1` correctly handle cases where one or two doors are available to open.  
- Recursion in `member/2` terminates correctly.  

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` and `open_door/1` comply with probabilistic rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled by negation in ProbLog.  
  - The host's choice is fair (`0.5` probability for each door when two are available).  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic for door selection and prize placement is correct.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with the Monty Hall problem's theoretical results.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases such as:  
  - Only one door available to open (deterministic).  
  - Two doors available (random choice).  
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.  

**Performance:**  
- The recursion depth is minimal (only 3 doors), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all requirements. No errors were found.
