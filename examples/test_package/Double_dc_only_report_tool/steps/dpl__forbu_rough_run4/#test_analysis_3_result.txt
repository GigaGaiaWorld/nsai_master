### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog Context**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate its correctness, adherence to ProbLog requirements, and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Result**: The test failed with the error: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:14`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Error Location**: Line 4, Column 14 in the `bubblesort/3` predicate.
- **Problem**: The `->/2` operator (if-then-else) is not recognized in the ProbLog context, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `->/2` operator is valid in standard Prolog but not supported in ProbLog's subset of Prolog.
  - The recursive termination is logically correct, but the implementation relies on unsupported syntax.
- **ProbLog Context**:
  - ProbLog does not support the `->/2` operator, which is required for conditional branching in the bubblesort logic.
  - No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used, so DeepProbLog features are not applicable here.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logical structure is correct, but syntax is incompatible with ProbLog).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested.
  - The `expand/2` predicate is undefined (not relevant here).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `->/2` operator unsupported in ProbLog | Code fails to execute | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible branching (e.g., `if_then_else/3` or separate clauses). |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation. |
| 3   | Deep recursion not tested | Possible stack overflow for large lists | Test with large inputs and optimize tail recursion. |

---

#### **8. Code Fix Suggestion**
Replace the `->/2` operator with ProbLog-compatible logic:
```prolog
bubblesort([H1, H2|T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    (H1 > H2 ->
        bubblesort([H1|T], [H2|Acc], Sorted)
    ;
        bubblesort([H2|T], [H1|Acc], Sorted)
    ).
```
Alternative (ProbLog-compatible):
```prolog
bubblesort([H1, H2|T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    (H1 > H2,
     bubblesort([H1|T], [H2|Acc], Sorted))
    ;
    (H1 =< H2,
     bubblesort([H2|T], [H1|Acc], Sorted)).
```

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The code fails due to ProbLog syntax incompatibility. Addressing the `->/2` issue and edge cases will resolve the errors.
