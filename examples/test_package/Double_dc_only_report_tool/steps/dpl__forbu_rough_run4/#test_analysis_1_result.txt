### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation with ProbLog Compatibility**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`  
- **Result**:  
  ```  
  Error evaluating ProbLog model: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:15.  
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: The test failed due to a syntax error in the Prolog code, specifically the use of `->` without proper clauses.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `bubblesort/3`  
  - **Line Interval**: 4-10  
  - **Issue**: The `->` operator is not correctly implemented for ProbLog, leading to an "UnknownClause" error.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate is logically correct for Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->` operator.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` and `bubblesort([H], Acc, Sorted)`).  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog does not natively support the `->` operator for conditional branching.  
  - The error indicates a mismatch between Prolog's classical syntax and ProbLog's probabilistic requirements.  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) or probabilistic facts are present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but syntax incompatible with ProbLog).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (due to `->` operator incompatibility).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: Not handled (e.g., `forth_sort(3, X)` would fail).  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for large lists due to the recursive nature of bubblesort.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1       | `->` operator unsupported in ProbLog | ProbLog evaluation fails            | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2       | No handling for non-list inputs      | Program crashes on invalid inputs   | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` check). |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**  
The code is logically sound for classical Prolog but requires modifications for ProbLog compatibility. Addressing the `->` operator and edge cases will ensure robustness.  

**Word Count**: ~450 words.
