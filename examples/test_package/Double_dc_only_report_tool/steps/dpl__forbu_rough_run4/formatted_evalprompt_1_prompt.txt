           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:15.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation with ProbLog Compatibility**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`  
- **Result**:  
  ```  
  Error evaluating ProbLog model: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:15.  
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: The test failed due to a syntax error in the Prolog code, specifically the use of `->` without proper clauses.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `bubblesort/3`  
  - **Line Interval**: 4-10  
  - **Issue**: The `->` operator is not correctly implemented for ProbLog, leading to an "UnknownClause" error.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate is logically correct for Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->` operator.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` and `bubblesort([H], Acc, Sorted)`).  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog does not natively support the `->` operator for conditional branching.  
  - The error indicates a mismatch between Prolog's classical syntax and ProbLog's probabilistic requirements.  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) or probabilistic facts are present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but syntax incompatible with ProbLog).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (due to `->` operator incompatibility).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: Not handled (e.g., `forth_sort(3, X)` would fail).  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for large lists due to the recursive nature of bubblesort.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1       | `->` operator unsupported in ProbLog | ProbLog evaluation fails            | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2       | No handling for non-list inputs      | Program crashes on invalid inputs   | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` check). |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**  
The code is logically sound for classical Prolog but requires modifications for ProbLog compatibility. Addressing the `->` operator and edge cases will ensure robustness.  

**Word Count**: ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
