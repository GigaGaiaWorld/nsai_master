</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, defining the game rules, calculating outcomes, and determining the winner based on a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs. `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
  - The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The code correctly implements the game rules and computes the winner as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The predicates `move/1` and `beats/2` correctly define the game rules.
  - The `outcome/3` predicate accurately determines the result of each move pair.
  - The recursive `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates handle lists of moves and results correctly.
- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination.
  - The recursive case reduces the list size in each step, guaranteeing termination.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`). Thus, no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)`) are violated.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes lists as input. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Empty Lists:** Handled correctly by the base case.
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance is linear with the length of the move lists, so no issues for typical game lengths.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **Final Remarks**
The code is well-structured and meets the requirements for classical reasoning in ProbLog. No failures were detected, and the implementation handles edge cases gracefully. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic features or neural network integration if needed. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
