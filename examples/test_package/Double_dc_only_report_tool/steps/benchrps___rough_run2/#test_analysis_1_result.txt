### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, defining the game rules, calculating outcomes, and determining the winner based on a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs. `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
  - The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The code correctly implements the game rules and computes the winner as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The predicates `move/1` and `beats/2` correctly define the game rules.
  - The `outcome/3` predicate accurately determines the result of each move pair.
  - The recursive `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates handle lists of moves and results correctly.
- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination.
  - The recursive case reduces the list size in each step, guaranteeing termination.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`). Thus, no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(Â¬A)`) are violated.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes lists as input. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Empty Lists:** Handled correctly by the base case.
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance is linear with the length of the move lists, so no issues for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **Final Remarks**
The code is well-structured and meets the requirements for classical reasoning in ProbLog. No failures were detected, and the implementation handles edge cases gracefully. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic features or neural network integration if needed.
