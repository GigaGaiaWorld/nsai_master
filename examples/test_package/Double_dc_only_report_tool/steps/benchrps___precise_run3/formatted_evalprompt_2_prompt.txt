</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the logic for determining game results and calculating the winner based on a list of moves. The evaluation focuses on classical ProbLog reasoning, as no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating an unknown clause for `''->'/2'` at line 41:77.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically due to a syntax issue in the conditional logic (`->` operator).
- **Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
- **Issue**: The conditional logic (`->`) is not properly formatted or supported in the ProbLog environment, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for determining the winner (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) is correct in isolation. However, the `determine_winner` predicate fails due to improper use of the `->` operator.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) correctly terminate for empty lists.
- **Probabilistic Context**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used, so this aspect is not applicable.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic for game results and scoring works, but the final predicate fails due to syntax issues.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not used.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion is not a concern here due to the simplicity of the game.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` (`->` operator) | Prevents winner determination | Replace `->` with a supported conditional construct (e.g., `if-then-else` in ProbLog). |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix Syntax**: Replace the `->` operator with a supported conditional construct in ProbLog.
2. **Input Validation**: Add checks to ensure `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists.
3. **Testing**: Add more test cases, including edge cases like empty lists or invalid moves.

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and concise.  
**Logic**: Clear and structured.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
