### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game logic.
- Analyze the test results and identify any failures.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules in ProbLog.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating that no clauses were found for an unspecified predicate (`''->'/2'`). This suggests a syntax or predicate definition issue in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
- **Error Location**: Line 41, column 77.
- **Root Cause**: The error points to an undefined predicate or a syntax issue in the `determine_winner` rule. The code block for `determine_winner` is incomplete or malformed.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog**:
  - The `determine_winner` predicate is intended to:
    1. Call `play/3` to compare moves and generate results.
    2. Use `compute_score/2` to calculate the score.
    3. Determine the winner based on the score.
  - The error suggests that the predicate is not correctly defined or is missing clauses.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so probabilistic reasoning rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog**:
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core game logic (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correctly implemented, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs for `play/3` or `compute_score/2` are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be an issue for very long move lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Undefined predicate in `determine_winner` | Test failure | Correct the predicate definition or add missing clauses. |
| 2   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` | Code execution failure | Verify and fix the syntax in the `determine_winner` rule. |
| 3   | No handling of non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code demonstrates a solid foundation for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game logic but fails due to an incomplete `determine_winner` predicate. Addressing this issue and adding input validation will ensure robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the focus should remain on classical reasoning correctness.
