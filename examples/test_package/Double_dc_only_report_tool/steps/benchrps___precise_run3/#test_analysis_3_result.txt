### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the logic, test results, and adherence to functional requirements, including classical reasoning and recursive termination. The analysis also checks for edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],'Player 2') = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies 'Player 2' as the winner, with a probability of 1.0000, which aligns with the game's rules (paper beats rock, and scissor loses to rock).

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules function as intended:
- **Predicates**:  
  - `move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3` are correctly defined.
- **Code Line Numbers**:  
  - The logic spans the entire code block without errors.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog**:  
  - The logic adheres to classical reasoning. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented (base cases and recursive steps are well-defined).
  - The `result/3` predicate accurately reflects the game's win-lose-draw rules.
- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation. The result is deterministic (probability 1.0000).
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game's logic and computes the winner.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes valid input lists (`P1Moves`, `P2Moves`). Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Empty Lists**: Handled correctly by `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for typical game lengths (no deep recursion issues).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The code is logically correct and passes all provided tests. No issues were identified. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog integration if needed.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.
