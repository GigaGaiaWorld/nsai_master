### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the logic for determining game results and calculating the winner based on a list of moves. The evaluation focuses on classical ProbLog reasoning, as no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating an unknown clause for `''->'/2'` at line 41:77.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically due to a syntax issue in the conditional logic (`->` operator).
- **Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
- **Issue**: The conditional logic (`->`) is not properly formatted or supported in the ProbLog environment, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for determining the winner (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) is correct in isolation. However, the `determine_winner` predicate fails due to improper use of the `->` operator.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) correctly terminate for empty lists.
- **Probabilistic Context**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used, so this aspect is not applicable.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic for game results and scoring works, but the final predicate fails due to syntax issues.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not used.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion is not a concern here due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` (`->` operator) | Prevents winner determination | Replace `->` with a supported conditional construct (e.g., `if-then-else` in ProbLog). |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix Syntax**: Replace the `->` operator with a supported conditional construct in ProbLog.
2. **Input Validation**: Add checks to ensure `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists.
3. **Testing**: Add more test cases, including edge cases like empty lists or invalid moves.
