### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Simulating Coin Tosses**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The functional requirement is to sample `CNT` independent coins and compute the total number of heads (`S`). The code includes a recursive predicate `coins_r/3` and a query `total(S)` to test the logic.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 9:25.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Expected:** A probabilistic result for the total number of heads after 4 coin tosses.  
  - **Actual:** Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator in the recursive rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `coins_r/3`  
  - **Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
        CNT > 0,
        coin(c1),
        (make_coin(c1, 0.8) -> SC1 is SC + 1 ; SC1 is SC),
        CNT1 is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1).
    ```
  - **Error Location:** Line 9, column 25 (the `->/2` operator).  
  - **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is not correctly defined or supported in the ProbLog context for this usage.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic is sound, but the use of `->/2` for conditional branching is incorrect in ProbLog. ProbLog does not support imperative-style conditionals like Prolog.  
  - **Probabilistic Rules:**  
    - The code attempts to use `make_coin(c1, 0.8)` as a probabilistic fact, but the conditional logic (`->/2`) disrupts the probabilistic reasoning.  
    - The correct approach is to use probabilistic facts directly without imperative branching.

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)` is correctly defined, ensuring termination.

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Feature Not Used:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but conditional branching fails).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to incorrect use of `->/2`.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` or non-list inputs are not relevant here.  
  - Deep recursion is handled correctly with the base case.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator       | Probabilistic reasoning fails   | Replace `->/2` with probabilistic facts.   |
| 2   | Incorrect conditional logic     | Logical flow disrupted          | Use `probabilistic_if/3` or similar.       |

---

### **Suggested Fix**  
Replace the conditional logic with probabilistic facts:  
```prolog
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(c1),
    (make_coin(c1, 0.8), SC1 is SC + 1 ; SC1 is SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1).
```

This ensures the probabilistic nature of the coin toss is preserved without imperative branching.
