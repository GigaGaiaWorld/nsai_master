### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The functional requirement is to sample `CNT` independent coins and compute the total number of heads (`S`). The code includes a recursive predicate `coins_r/3` and a query `total(S)` to test the logic.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `total(S)`  
  **Expected Result:** A probabilistic distribution of the total number of heads after tossing 4 coins.  
  **Actual Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = self.handle_nonground(
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
  problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```
  **Conclusion:** The test failed due to a non-ground probabilistic clause.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `total(S)`  
  **Error Location:**  
  - Line 1: `PH::make_coin(C,PH).`  
  - The error occurs because the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,PH)` is not grounded (i.e., `C` is a variable).  
  **Impact:** The program cannot evaluate the probabilistic clause, leading to a runtime error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the non-ground probabilistic fact.  
  - The termination condition (`CNT > 0`) ensures the recursion halts.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The error violates ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be grounded (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).  
  - The clause `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground because `C` is unbound.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the query fails).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (non-ground probabilistic clause).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-ground Probabilistic Facts:** Overlooked in the initial implementation.  
  - **Recursive Performance:** Not an issue here due to small `CNT` (4).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | Runtime error                  | Ground the variable `C` in `make_coin(C,PH)` (e.g., `make_coin(c1,0.8)`). |
| 2   | Missing DeepProbLog features     | N/A                            | Not applicable for this code.       |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**
The code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic clause, which is a common pitfall in ProbLog. The fix involves grounding the probabilistic fact. The recursive logic is otherwise sound. No DeepProbLog features are used.
