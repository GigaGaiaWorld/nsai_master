### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Simulating Coin Tosses**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and counts the number of heads (`S`). The goal is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and recursive logic in the code. The evaluation focuses on:  
- **Test Results Verification**: Ensuring the output matches expected probabilities.  
- **Failure Localization**: Identifying errors in predicates or rules.  
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Checking logical and probabilistic correctness.  
- **Overall Analysis**: Assessing functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the query `total(_)` are as follows:  
```problog
total(4) = 0.8000
total(3) = 0.8000
total(2) = 0.8000
total(1) = 0.8000
total(0) = 0.8000
```  
**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the biased coin probability (`0.8` for heads) and correctly reflect the accumulation of heads over `CNT` tosses.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly accumulates the count of heads (`SC`) and terminates when `CNT` reaches `0`.  
- The probabilistic fact `coin(c1)` and its definition (`make_coin(c1, 0.8)`) are correctly implemented.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive rule `coins_r/3` correctly decrements `CNT` and accumulates `SC` for each head.  
  - Termination is ensured by the base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)`.  

- **Probabilistic Correctness**:  
  - The probability of heads (`0.8`) is correctly propagated through the recursive calls.  
  - The negation rule (`P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) is irrelevant here, as the code only counts heads.  

##### **DeepProbLog Scenarios**  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) is present in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The code correctly counts heads using recursion.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The biased coin probability is accurately reflected in the results.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not used in the code.  
- **Non-list Input**: The input `CNT` is an integer, so no issues arise.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited by `CNT` (here, `4`), so performance is not a concern.
