  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot). Edge cases (empty stack, non-list input) are not handled but were not part of the original requirements.",
  "SuggestedFix": "None needed for the current requirements. For robustness, consider adding input validation and empty stack handling (e.g., `stack_op(pop, [], _) :- fail`).",
