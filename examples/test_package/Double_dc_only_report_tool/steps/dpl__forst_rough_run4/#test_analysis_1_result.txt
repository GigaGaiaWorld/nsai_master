### Code Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Stack Operations Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 1, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected behavior for each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates and rules function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are logically sound. Each operation correctly manipulates the stack as per its definition.
- **Recursive Termination:** The code does not involve recursion, so termination is not a concern.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The results show deterministic behavior (probability 1.0000), indicating no probabilistic facts or implications are involved. Thus, no probabilistic rules need verification.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are present. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations are correctly implemented and tested.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` require a non-empty stack. Edge cases with empty stacks are not handled.
  - **Performance:** No deep recursion or performance issues are present.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input handling | Runtime errors | Add input validation for stack operations. |
| 2 | Empty stack edge cases | Runtime errors | Handle empty stack cases gracefully. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code successfully implements the required stack operations in ProbLog, passing all provided test cases. However, edge cases (e.g., empty stack or non-list inputs) should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized. The evaluation confirms the logical correctness of the classical reasoning implementation.
