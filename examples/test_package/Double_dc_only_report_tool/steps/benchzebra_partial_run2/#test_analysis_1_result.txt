### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test result provided is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification**: The output matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, where all constraints are satisfied.
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures** were detected in the provided test result. All predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the solution adheres to the puzzle's constraints.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code correctly implements the puzzle's constraints using predicates like `my_member`, `right_of`, and `next_to`. Recursive termination is ensured in these predicates.
- **Probabilistic Compliance**: The result `1.0000` indicates deterministic reasoning (no probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation). Thus, no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved deterministically.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable.
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Houses` is a list of 5 houses. No checks for invalid inputs are present.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and adheres to the puzzle's constraints. No failures or edge cases were identified. The code is purely deterministic, and no DeepProbLog features are utilized. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation for robustness.
