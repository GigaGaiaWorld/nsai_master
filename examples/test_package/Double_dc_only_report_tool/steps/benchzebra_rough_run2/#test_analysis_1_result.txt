### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:** The output matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, confirming that all constraints are satisfied.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Expansion Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3` are correctly defined and function as intended.  
  - No undefined predicates or edge cases were overlooked.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The code adheres to the puzzle's constraints, such as the positioning of houses, nationalities, pets, drinks, and cigarettes.  
  - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The result has a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic correctness.  
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used, so no further analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **Not used.** The implementation is purely classical ProbLog without neural network integration.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved deterministically.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here, as the solution is deterministic.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Input Validation:** The code assumes valid input (a list of 5 houses). Non-list inputs or incorrect lengths would fail.  
  - **Performance:** Recursive predicates are efficient for small lists but may face performance issues with larger datasets.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 350 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the puzzle's requirements. No failures or probabilistic inconsistencies were detected. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation and exploring probabilistic extensions if needed.
