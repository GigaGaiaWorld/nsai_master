### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to requirements, and ensure it handles edge cases appropriately. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, recursive termination, and probabilistic correctness (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed with the correct sorted output and a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Length Check**: The `length(List, Len)` and `Len > 1` conditions ensure recursive boundary judgment.  
2. **Splitting**: The `split_list` predicate correctly divides the list into `Left` and `Right` sublists.  
3. **Recursive Sorting**: The `merge_sort` calls on `Left` and `Right` are correctly implemented.  
4. **Merging**: The `merge` predicate combines the sorted sublists accurately.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The code follows the divide-and-conquer strategy of merge sort. Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`).  
  - **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:  
  - The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved in this query.  
  - **DeepProbLog**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements merge sort.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this test case.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very large lists due to recursive splitting.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical ProbLog requirements. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized. Future improvements could include handling non-list inputs and optimizing for large datasets.
