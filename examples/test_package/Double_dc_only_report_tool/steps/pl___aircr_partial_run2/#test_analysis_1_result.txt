#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog: Functional and Probabilistic Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The system simulates the movement of flaps under varying wind conditions and actuator strengths, with the goal of reaching a target position (`goal(4)`). The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical flow, and edge-case handling.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` for time steps `T = 1` to `5`:
- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`
- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Verification**: All tests pass (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior:
- The decreasing trend in `goal_reached` probabilities reflects the increasing uncertainty over time.
- The low but non-zero `overrun_exception` probabilities account for edge cases where the flap position exceeds legal bounds.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules are correctly defined:
- **`flap_position/2`**: Correctly updates the flap position if legal (line 10-12).
- **`overrun_exception/1`**: Correctly identifies illegal positions (line 15-17).
- **`goal_reached/1`**: Accurately checks if the goal is met (line 20-22).
- **`attempted_flap_position/2`**: Properly models actuator and wind effects (line 25-33).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.
  - The logic for updating the flap position (`Pos is Old + AE + WE`) is sound.
- **Probabilistic Rules**:
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.
  - The `overrun_exception` probabilities correctly reflect the likelihood of illegal positions.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code (no `nn/3` or `tensor/…` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met (e.g., legal position checks).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met (e.g., wind and actuator probabilities).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles undefined positions via `legal_flap_position`.
  - No deep recursion or non-list inputs are present.
