### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population density. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division, ensuring robustness. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the logic, testing results, and adherence to requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population density, as per the specified inequality `20×D1 < 21×D2`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the test results align with the expected output.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic is sound. The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the integer population density using floor division, and the `query_pop/1` predicate ensures the comparison avoids floating-point operations.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used, so termination is not a concern.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the query logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`, `query_pop/1`) are defined.  
- **Non-List Input:** The input format is enforced by the query structure.  
- **Performance:** The code is efficient, with no deep recursion or performance bottlenecks.

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured, meets all requirements, and passes all tests. No issues or improvements are identified. The use of integer arithmetic for density comparison is a robust choice.

**Code Block for Reference:**
```prolog
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 \= C2,
    20 * D1 < 21 * D2,
    20 * D2 < 21 * D1.

density(C, D) :-
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    D is (P * 100) // A.
