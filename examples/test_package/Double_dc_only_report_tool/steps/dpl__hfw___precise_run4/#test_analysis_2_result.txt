### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The goal is to correctly interpret the images as numbers and operators, then compute the result of the expression. The evaluation focuses on:
- Correctness of the parsing logic.
- Accuracy of the arithmetic operations.
- Compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Expected Result:** The expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` should evaluate to `-13.6667`.
- **Actual Result:** The code returned `11.666666666666666` with a probability of `1.0000`.

**Conclusion:** The test failed. The actual result does not match the expected value.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query involving the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`.
- **Error Location:** The issue lies in the `parse/2` predicates, specifically in the handling of operator precedence and parentheses. The current implementation does not account for the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS rules).
- **Code Block with Error:**
  ```prolog
  parse([N1, +, N2 | T], R) :- 
      parse([N1 + N2 | T], R).
  parse([N1, -, N2 | T], R) :- 
      parse([N1 - N2 | T], R).
  parse([N1, *, N2 | T], R) :- 
      parse([N1 * N2 | T], R).
  parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :- 
      parse([N1 / N2 | T], R).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `parse/2` predicates process the list left-to-right without considering operator precedence. For example, `2 / (3 + 3)` is incorrectly parsed as `(2 / 3) + 3`.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly, but the logic is flawed due to incorrect parsing order.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code parses and evaluates expressions but fails to handle operator precedence.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid images are not handled.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable for typical expressions but could be problematic for very long lists.

|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong arithmetic results        | Implement PEMDAS/BODMAS rules in `parse/2` |
| 2   | No handling of invalid inputs    | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation checks                |
| 3   | DeepProbLog not utilized         | Limited functionality           | Consider integrating neural networks       |
