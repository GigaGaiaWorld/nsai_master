#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The goal is to correctly interpret sequences of numbers and operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and compute the result. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and adherence to probabilistic rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The result `11.666666666666668` matches the expected computation of `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**: All queries returned the expected results.  
- **Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use expansion predicates like `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, or `expand/2`. Thus, no verification is required for these.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `parse/2` predicates correctly handle arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and recursively evaluate the list of symbols.  
  - The `almost_equal/2` predicate ensures floating-point precision for comparisons.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion terminates when the list is reduced to a single element (`parse([N], R)`).  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. Thus, no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  The code does not integrate neural networks (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`). **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**:  
  - Non-list inputs or invalid symbols (e.g., `[image_2, image_unknown]`) are not handled.  
- **Deep Recursion**:  
  - The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, which is manageable for typical expressions but could be problematic for very long lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list inputs not handled | Runtime errors             | Add input validation predicates.   |
| 2      | Deep recursion risk         | Potential stack overflow   | Optimize tail recursion or limit input size. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code meets its primary functional requirements for classical reasoning but lacks robustness for edge cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized. Enhancements should focus on input validation and recursion optimization.
