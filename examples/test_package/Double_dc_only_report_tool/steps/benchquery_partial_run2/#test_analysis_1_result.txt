### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Density Query Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The code uses classical Prolog predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`) and a query predicate (`query_pop/1`) to compute and compare densities.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided are as follows:
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`

**Verification:**
- All test results return a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the queries are deterministic (classical Prolog) and the results are consistent with the expected output.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** All queries returned the expected results with a probability of `1.0000`.
- **Expansion Predicates:** The code does not use any expansion predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so no verification is required for these.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly computes the population density as `(P*100)//A`.
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the densities of the two countries (`D1` and `D2`) satisfy the condition `20*D1 < 21*D2` and `D1 > D2`, which is logically sound for identifying "approximately equal" densities.
- **Recursive Termination:** The code does not involve recursion, so termination is not a concern.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
- **DeepProbLog:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`). **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements classical Prolog predicates and queries.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`) are fully defined.
  - **Non-list Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list of four elements (`[C1,D1,C2,D2]`). No handling for malformed input is provided, but this is not required for the given test cases.
  - **Performance:** The code is efficient for the given dataset, with no deep recursion or performance bottlenecks.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is correct and meets all specified requirements. No failures or issues were identified.
