  "ErrorSummary": "The `clause/2` predicate integration fails, causing all extended logic predicates to fail with an AttributeError. The `implies/2` predicate is defined but cannot be tested due to this issue.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the `clause/2` call with ProbLog-compatible database access (e.g., using `problog`'s built-in predicates or ensuring the database is properly initialized). Modify the meta-interpreter to use `problog`'s internal clause retrieval mechanism instead of raw `clause/2`.",
