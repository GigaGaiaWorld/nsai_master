### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a basic meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extended with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 1.0000 (Pass)  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 0.0000 (Fail)  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 0.0000 (Fail)  
- `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` = 0.0000 (Fail)  
- `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` = 0.0000 (Fail)  

**Conclusion:** Only one test passed. The remaining tests failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
1. **Failed Query:** `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))`  
   - **Expected:** 1.0000 (since `parent(carol,alice)` is false).  
   - **Actual:** 0.0000.  
   - **Issue:** The `opposite/1` predicate is not defined in the code.  

2. **Failed Query:** `prove(expand(double(3),6))`  
   - **Expected:** 1.0000 (since `double(3)` should yield 6).  
   - **Actual:** 0.0000.  
   - **Issue:** The `expand/2` predicate is defined but not integrated into the `prove/1` logic.  

3. **Failed Query:** `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))`  
   - **Expected:** 1.0000 (since `b` is in the list).  
   - **Actual:** 0.0000.  
   - **Issue:** The `includes/2` predicate is not defined.  

4. **Failed Query:** `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))`  
   - **Expected:** 1.0000 (since `extend` should prepend 3 to the list).  
   - **Actual:** 0.0000.  
   - **Issue:** The `extend/3` predicate is not defined.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The `implies/2` predicate is correctly implemented, as evidenced by the passing test.  
  - Missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) are not defined, leading to failures.  
  - The `expand/2` predicate is defined but not linked to the `prove/1` logic.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code.  
  - The negation rule (`P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) is not applied due to missing `opposite/1` implementation.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present.  
  - **Conclusion:** DeepProbLog features are not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - Classical reasoning is partially met (only `implies/2` works).  
  - Probabilistic reasoning is not implemented.  
  - Neural network integration is absent.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) cause failures.  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not tested.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `opposite/1` not defined         | Negation logic fails       | Define `opposite(Goal) :- \+ Goal`. |
| 2   | `expand/2` not linked to `prove/1` | Expansion fails            | Add `prove(expand(X, Y)) :- expand(X, Y).` |
| 3   | `includes/2` not defined         | List membership fails      | Define `includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).` |
| 4   | `extend/3` not defined           | List extension fails       | Define `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).` |

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revisions to meet the specified requirements. Focus on implementing missing predicates and integrating them into the `prove/1` logic.
