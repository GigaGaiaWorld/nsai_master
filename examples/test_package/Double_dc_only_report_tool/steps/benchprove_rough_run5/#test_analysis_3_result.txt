### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a basic meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extended with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` = 0.0000  

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (returned `0.0000`), indicating incorrect implementations or missing definitions for the extended predicates.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query 1:** `implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob))`  
  - **Issue:** The `implies/2` predicate is defined as `\+ P; Q`, but it does not handle probabilistic facts correctly.  
  - **Code Location:** Line with `implies(P, Q) :- \+ P; Q.`  

- **Failed Query 2:** `opposite(parent(carol,alice))`  
  - **Issue:** The `opposite/1` predicate is not defined in the code.  
  - **Code Location:** Missing definition.  

- **Failed Query 3:** `expand(double(3),6)`  
  - **Issue:** The `expand/2` predicate is defined for `double` and `square`, but the test result suggests incorrect handling or missing probabilistic context.  
  - **Code Location:** Lines defining `expand(double(X), Y)` and `expand(square(X), Y)`.  

- **Failed Query 4:** `includes([a,b,c],b)`  
  - **Issue:** The `includes/2` predicate is not defined.  
  - **Code Location:** Missing definition.  

- **Failed Query 5:** `extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2])`  
  - **Issue:** The `extend/3` predicate is not defined.  
  - **Code Location:** Missing definition.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
  - The `implies/2` predicate does not account for probabilistic implications (`P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`).  
  - Missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) violate the requirements.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The `expand/2` predicate does not integrate probabilistic facts.  
  - Negation (`\+`) in `implies/2` is not probabilistic (`P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (basic meta-interpreter works, but extended predicates are missing or incorrect).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (probabilistic implications and negations are not handled).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`).  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` are not handled.  
  - Recursive termination is not verified for `expand/2`.

| 2   | Missing `includes/2` definition  | Query fails                     | Define `includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).` |
| 3   | Missing `extend/3` definition    | Query fails                     | Define `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).` |
| 4   | Incorrect `implies/2` handling   | Probabilistic logic incorrect   | Redefine using `P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`    |
| 5   | `expand/2` not probabilistic     | Query fails                     | Integrate probabilistic facts       |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revisions to meet the specified requirements, particularly in defining missing predicates and ensuring probabilistic correctness.
