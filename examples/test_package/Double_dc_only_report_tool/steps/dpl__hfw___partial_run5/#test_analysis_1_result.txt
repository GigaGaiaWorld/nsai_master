### Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Number and Operator Detection**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to detect numbers and operators from images and perform arithmetic operations. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], -10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The result matches the expected calculation:  
  `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7 = -10.333333333333332`.  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`), so this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The predicates `detect_number`, `detect_operator`, and `detect_all` are correctly defined and recursively process the input list.  
  The `parse` predicate handles arithmetic operations accurately, including edge cases like division by zero (`N2 \== 0`).  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `detect_all` and `parse` terminates correctly when the input list is fully processed.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`), so this section is not applicable.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Neural Network Calls**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly performs arithmetic operations and handles recursion.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Division by Zero**: Handled explicitly in the `parse` predicate.  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of images. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited by the input list length, so performance is not a concern for typical use cases.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~350 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code is logically correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. No failures were detected in the provided test case. Edge cases like division by zero are handled, but non-list inputs are not validated. DeepProbLog features are not utilized.
