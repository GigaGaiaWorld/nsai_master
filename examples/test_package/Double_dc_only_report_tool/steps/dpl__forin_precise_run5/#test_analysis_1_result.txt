### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and ensure it meets functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed with the correct sorted output and a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `insertion_sort/2`: Correctly implements recursive sorting and insertion.  
  - `insert_element/3`: Handles element insertion into the sorted list as required.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.  
  - The recursive case `insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted)` correctly sorts the tail and inserts the head.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion terminates as the list is reduced to the empty list in the base case.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)`, `P(A⇒B)`).  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements insertion sort.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list. Non-list inputs would fail.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation is correct for classical ProbLog scenarios. For probabilistic or DeepProbLog extensions, additional features would need to be incorporated. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be handled for robustness.  

**Word Count**: ~350 words.
