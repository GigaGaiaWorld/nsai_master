### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, where each coin has a probability of 0.8 to land heads. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) over a decreasing counter (`CNT`) and accumulate the results into `S`. The code is tested with a query `total(_)`, which returns the probabilities of achieving different success counts (`S`) after 4 tosses.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `total(4) = 0.4096`
- `total(3) = 0.4096`
- `total(2) = 0.1536`
- `total(1) = 0.0256`
- `total(0) = 0.0016`

**Verification:**
- The results align with the binomial distribution for 4 trials with success probability 0.8:
  - `P(4 heads) = 0.8^4 = 0.4096`
  - `P(3 heads) = C(4,3) * 0.8^3 * 0.2 = 0.4096`
  - `P(2 heads) = C(4,2) * 0.8^2 * 0.2^2 = 0.1536`
  - `P(1 head) = C(4,1) * 0.8 * 0.2^3 = 0.0256`
  - `P(0 heads) = 0.2^4 = 0.0016`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The code correctly implements the recursive counting logic and probabilistic reasoning.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly decrements `CNT` and updates `SC` based on the outcome of `coin(CNT)`.
  - The base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)` ensures termination when `CNT` reaches 0.

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**
  - The probability of `coin(C)` is defined as 0.8, and its negation (`\+coin(C)`) implicitly has a probability of 0.2, adhering to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.
  - The results comply with the binomial distribution, confirming correct probabilistic computation.

- **DeepProbLog Features:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The recursive logic correctly counts successes.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the code.
  - **Non-list Input:** Not applicable here.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (`CNT` starts at 4), so performance is not an issue.
