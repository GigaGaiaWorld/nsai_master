### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Navigation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and navigates between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5898`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key interactions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases and the use of `s(T)` for time steps.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `fumbles_key/1` comply with the rule `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
  - The implications (e.g., `drops(key,T) :- slippery(key,T), drop_slippery_key(T)`) are correctly modeled.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key interactions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and applied.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates were found.  
- **Non-List Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs, but this is not required for the given scenario.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given time steps (`s(s(s(0)))`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is well-structured, logically correct, and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified during the evaluation.

**Final Note:** The evaluation confirms the robustness of the ProbLog implementation for the given scenario. Further enhancements could include integrating DeepProbLog features for more complex reasoning tasks.
