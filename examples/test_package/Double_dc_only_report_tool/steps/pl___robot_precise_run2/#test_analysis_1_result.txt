### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot interacts with a key, including actions like picking up the key, moving to different locations, and handling probabilistic outcomes of these actions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

- `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.4331`  
- `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.9000`  
- `at(robot, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0900`  
- `at(robot, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0100`  
- `at(key, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.5670`  
- `at(key, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.4330`  
- `at(key, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, given the probabilistic rules and actions defined in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying(key, s(T))`) correctly handle termination by ensuring base cases and recursive steps are well-defined.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as the robot failing to move (`goto_fails(T)`) or the key being slippery (`slippery(key, T)`).  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds(T)`, `drop_slippery_key(T)`, and `fumbles_key(T)` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`).  
- **Negation as Failure:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is correctly applied in predicates like `drops(key, T)` and `at(key, Pos, s(T))`.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Neural Network Calls:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and their outcomes.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly implemented.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog features not used).  

##### **Edge Cases and Performance**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates or expansion issues were detected.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given scenario, and no performance bottlenecks are observed.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured, logically correct, and adheres to the specified requirements. No issues were identified during testing, and the probabilistic reasoning is sound. For future enhancements, consider integrating DeepProbLog features if neural network-based reasoning is required.
