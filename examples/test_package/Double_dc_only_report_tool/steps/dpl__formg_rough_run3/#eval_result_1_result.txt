{
  "HASH": "418D2062",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core merge sort logic. The implementation passes the provided test case and adheres to the merge sort algorithm. However, non-list inputs are not handled gracefully, and deep recursion may cause performance issues for very large lists.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add type-checking for input lists (e.g., `is_list/1` guard clauses). 2. Consider optimizing tail recursion or using iterative methods for large lists to prevent stack overflow.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
