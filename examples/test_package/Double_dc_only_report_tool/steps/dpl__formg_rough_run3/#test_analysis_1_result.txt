### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`), which recursively splits a list into halves, sorts them, and merges the results. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The implementation correctly handles the provided test case. All predicates (`merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, `merge/3`) function as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**  
1. **Logical Correctness**:  
   - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined.  
   - The recursive splitting (`split/3`) and merging (`merge/3`) predicates adhere to the merge sort algorithm.  
   - Termination is guaranteed as the list is split into smaller halves until base cases are reached.

2. **Edge Cases**:  
   - **Empty List**: Handled by the first rule.  
   - **Single-Element List**: Handled by the second rule.  
   - **Non-List Input**: Not explicitly handled, but Prolog's type system will raise an error if non-list input is provided.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**  
- **Probabilistic Features**:  
  The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - **DeepProbLog**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement           | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning   | Met         | The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in Prolog.                    |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic features are used.                                         |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Applicable | No DeepProbLog features are used.                                           |

##### **Edge Cases and Performance**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs are not handled gracefully (e.g., `merge_sort(123, X)`).  
- **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very large lists due to Prolog's stack limitations.  
- **Missing Predicates**: No auxiliary predicates like `expand/2` or `implies/2` are used or required.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add type-checking or guard clauses.         |
| 2   | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs and may face performance issues with very large lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
