</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`), which recursively splits a list into halves, sorts them, and merges the results. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The implementation correctly handles the provided test case. All predicates (`merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, `merge/3`) function as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**  
1. **Logical Correctness**:  
   - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined.  
   - The recursive splitting (`split/3`) and merging (`merge/3`) predicates adhere to the merge sort algorithm.  
   - Termination is guaranteed as the list is split into smaller halves until base cases are reached.

2. **Edge Cases**:  
   - **Empty List**: Handled by the first rule.  
   - **Single-Element List**: Handled by the second rule.  
   - **Non-List Input**: Not explicitly handled, but Prolog's type system will raise an error if non-list input is provided.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**  
- **Probabilistic Features**:  
  The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - **DeepProbLog**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement           | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning   | Met         | The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in Prolog.                    |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic features are used.                                         |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Applicable | No DeepProbLog features are used.                                           |

##### **Edge Cases and Performance**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs are not handled gracefully (e.g., `merge_sort(123, X)`).  
- **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very large lists due to Prolog's stack limitations.  
- **Missing Predicates**: No auxiliary predicates like `expand/2` or `implies/2` are used or required.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add type-checking or guard clauses.         |
| 2   | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs and may face performance issues with very large lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.  

**Word Count**: ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
</Final_Answer>
