### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot interacts with a key, including actions like picking up the key, moving to different locations, and handling probabilistic outcomes of these actions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key interactions, including probabilistic outcomes.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases and the use of `s(T)` for time progression.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as the robot failing to move (`goto_fails(T)`) or not performing any action (`\+ goto_action(T)`).  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds(T)`, `drop_slippery_key(T)`, and `goto_succeeds(T)` comply with the rules `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` and `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`.  
- **Negation as Failure:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is correctly applied in predicates like `drops(key,T)` and `carrying(key,s(T))`.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** The code does not use DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key interactions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic outcomes are correctly computed and integrated.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

##### **Edge Cases and Performance**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given scenario.  
- **Input Validation:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `do/2` actions are correctly defined).
