### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code defines a simple ProbLog program for digit recognition and addition logic. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the digit predicates and the addition rule, ensuring they meet the specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning and probabilistic correctness, with no DeepProbLog features involved.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(addition(img_5, img_6, Z))`  
  - **Result:** `addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000`  
  - **Verification:** The result matches the expected output (5 + 6 = 11) with a probability of 1.0000.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The addition logic correctly computes the sum of the digits represented by the images.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- All predicates (`digit/2` and `addition/3`) are correctly defined and satisfy the requirements.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `digit/2` predicates correctly map images to their respective digits.  
  - The `addition/3` rule accurately sums the digits extracted from the images.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - No recursion is used in the provided code, so termination is not a concern.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - The `digit/2` facts are deterministic (probability 1.0000), so no probabilistic rules (e.g., negation or implication) are involved.  

- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements digit recognition and addition.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (all facts are deterministic).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates or edge cases detected.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable (inputs are atomic terms).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not applicable (no recursion).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|

### **Final Remarks**  
The code is functionally correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized, and no edge cases or failures were identified. The addition logic is straightforward and accurate.
