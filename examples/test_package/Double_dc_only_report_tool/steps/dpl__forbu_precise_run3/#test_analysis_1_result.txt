### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`  
  - **Result:** `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  
  - **Verification:** The test passes, as the output matches the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly sorts the input list and adheres to the specified requirements.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `swap/3`: Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on their values.  
  - `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3`: Recursively sort the list by bubbling the largest element to the end.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `swap/3` predicate correctly implements the comparison logic (`X > Y` for swap, `X =< Y` for no swap).  
  - The `bubble/3` predicate ensures the largest element is moved to the end of the list in each iteration.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively processes the remaining unsorted list, terminating when the list is empty.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`bubblesort([],L,L)`), ensuring no infinite loops.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the bubble sort algorithm.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to performance issues (stack overflow).  
- **Undefined Cases:** The `expand/2` predicate is not used or defined in this code.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Performance issues | Optimize or use iterative methods for large datasets. |
| 3      | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic sorting | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is logically correct and meets the classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. Enhancements could include input validation and performance optimizations for larger datasets.
