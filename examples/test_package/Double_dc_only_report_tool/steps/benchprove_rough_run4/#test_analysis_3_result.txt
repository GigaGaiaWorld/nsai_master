### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a basic meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extended with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` = 0.0000  

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (returned `0.0000`), indicating incorrect implementations or missing predicates.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query 1:** `implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob))`  
  - **Issue:** The `implies/2` predicate is defined but does not handle probabilistic implications correctly.  
  - **Code Location:** Line defining `implies/2`.  

- **Failed Query 2:** `opposite(parent(carol,alice))`  
  - **Issue:** The `opposite/1` predicate is missing.  
  - **Code Location:** Not implemented.  

- **Failed Query 3:** `expand(double(3),6)`  
  - **Issue:** The `expand/2` predicate is defined but not integrated with the meta-interpreter.  
  - **Code Location:** Line defining `expand/2`.  

- **Failed Query 4:** `includes([a, b, c],b)`  
  - **Issue:** The `includes/2` predicate is missing.  
  - **Code Location:** Not implemented.  

- **Failed Query 5:** `extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])`  
  - **Issue:** The `extend/3` predicate is missing.  
  - **Code Location:** Not implemented.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The meta-interpreter (`prove/1`) correctly handles basic goals but fails to integrate the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.).  
  - Recursive termination is correct for `member/2` and `ancestor/2`.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
  - The `implies/2` predicate does not compute probabilities as per `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.  
  - Missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) violate the requirements.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - Classical reasoning is partially met (basic predicates work, extended predicates fail).  
  - Probabilistic reasoning is not fully implemented.  
  - Neural network integration is absent.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` rules for non-numeric inputs.  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion performance is untested.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `implies/2` incorrect logic      | Probabilistic implications fail | Implement `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`    |
| 2   | Missing `opposite/1`             | Negation not supported          | Define `opposite(A) :- \+ prove(A)` |
| 3   | `expand/2` not integrated        | Expansion fails                 | Integrate with `prove/1`            |
| 4   | Missing `includes/2`             | List membership fails           | Define `includes(List, Elem)`       |
| 5   | Missing `extend/3`               | List extension fails            | Define `extend(List, Elem, NewList)` |
