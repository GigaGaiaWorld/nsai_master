expand(square(X), Y) :- Y is X*X.
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, carol).
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y).

% --------- Queries ---------- %

query(prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))).
query(prove(expand(double(3),6))).
query(prove(includes([a,b,c],b))).
query(prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))).
<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 0.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a basic meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extended with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` = 0.0000  
- `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` = 0.0000  

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (returned `0.0000`), indicating incorrect implementations or missing predicates.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query 1:** `implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob))`  
  - **Issue:** The `implies/2` predicate is defined but does not handle probabilistic implications correctly.  
  - **Code Location:** Line defining `implies/2`.  

- **Failed Query 2:** `opposite(parent(carol,alice))`  
  - **Issue:** The `opposite/1` predicate is missing.  
  - **Code Location:** Not implemented.  

- **Failed Query 3:** `expand(double(3),6)`  
  - **Issue:** The `expand/2` predicate is defined but not integrated with the meta-interpreter.  
  - **Code Location:** Line defining `expand/2`.  

- **Failed Query 4:** `includes([a, b, c],b)`  
  - **Issue:** The `includes/2` predicate is missing.  
  - **Code Location:** Not implemented.  

- **Failed Query 5:** `extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])`  
  - **Issue:** The `extend/3` predicate is missing.  
  - **Code Location:** Not implemented.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The meta-interpreter (`prove/1`) correctly handles basic goals but fails to integrate the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.).  
  - Recursive termination is correct for `member/2` and `ancestor/2`.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
  - The `implies/2` predicate does not compute probabilities as per `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.  
  - Missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) violate the requirements.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - Classical reasoning is partially met (basic predicates work, extended predicates fail).  
  - Probabilistic reasoning is not fully implemented.  
  - Neural network integration is absent.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` rules for non-numeric inputs.  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion performance is untested.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `implies/2` incorrect logic      | Probabilistic implications fail | Implement `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`    |
| 2   | Missing `opposite/1`             | Negation not supported          | Define `opposite(A) :- \+ prove(A)` |
| 3   | `expand/2` not integrated        | Expansion fails                 | Integrate with `prove/1`            |
| 4   | Missing `includes/2`             | List membership fails           | Define `includes(List, Elem)`       |
| 5   | Missing `extend/3`               | List extension fails            | Define `extend(List, Elem, NewList)` |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revisions to meet the specified requirements, particularly in implementing missing predicates and correcting probabilistic logic.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
