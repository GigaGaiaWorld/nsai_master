### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing Predicates**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a ProbLog program with extended logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the code and its test results.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic reasoning.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog and DeepProbLog requirements.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
```prolog
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 0.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000
```  
**Conclusion:** All tests failed (returned `0.0000`).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query 1:** `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))`  
  - **Expected:** Should return `1.0000` (true).  
  - **Actual:** `0.0000`.  
  - **Error Location:** `implies/2` predicate (line with hash `3F5BA02C`).  

- **Failed Query 2:** `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))`  
  - **Expected:** Should return `1.0000` (true, as `parent(carol,alice)` is false).  
  - **Actual:** `0.0000`.  
  - **Error Location:** Missing `opposite/1` predicate.  

- **Failed Query 3:** `prove(expand(double(3),6))`  
  - **Expected:** `1.0000` (true, as `6` is the result of `double(3)`).  
  - **Actual:** `0.0000`.  
  - **Error Location:** `expand/2` predicate (incorrect implementation).  

- **Failed Query 4:** `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))`  
  - **Expected:** `1.0000` (true, as `b` is in the list).  
  - **Actual:** `0.0000`.  
  - **Error Location:** Missing `includes/2` predicate.  

- **Failed Query 5:** `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))`  
  - **Expected:** `1.0000` (true, as `[3,1,2]` is the result of extending `[1,2]` with `3`).  
  - **Actual:** `0.0000`.  
  - **Error Location:** Missing `extend/3` predicate.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The `implies/2` predicate is incorrectly implemented. It should return `1.0000` for valid implications.  
  - Missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) cause queries to fail.  
  - The `expand/2` predicate is defined but not correctly linked to the `prove/1` meta-interpreter.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
  - The negation rule `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is not applied in `opposite/1`.  
  - The implication rule `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)` is not correctly implemented in `implies/2`.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (missing predicates).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (incorrect negation/implication handling).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` for non-numeric inputs.  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion in `ancestor/2` could lead to performance issues.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect `implies/2` predicate  | Invalid implication results     | Correct the logic for `implies/2`.  |
| 2   | Missing `opposite/1` predicate   | Negation queries fail           | Implement `opposite/1`.             |
| 3   | Incorrect `expand/2` linkage     | Expansion queries fail          | Link `expand/2` to `prove/1`.       |
| 4   | Missing `includes/2` predicate   | List membership queries fail    | Implement `includes/2`.             |
| 5   | Missing `extend/3` predicate     | List extension queries fail     | Implement `extend/3`.               |

**Word Count:** 450 words.

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revisions to meet the functional requirements and handle edge cases. Focus on implementing missing predicates and correcting logical errors.
