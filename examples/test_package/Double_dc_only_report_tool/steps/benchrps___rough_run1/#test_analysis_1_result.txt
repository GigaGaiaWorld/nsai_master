### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, defining the game rules, calculating outcomes, and determining the winner based on a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. The moves `[rock, rock, rock]` vs. `[paper, paper, scissor]` yield:
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: `lose` (paper beats rock)
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: `lose`
    - `rock` vs. `scissor`: `win` (rock beats scissor)
  - The total score is `-1 + -1 + 1 = -1`, so `player2` wins.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The code correctly implements the game logic and computes the winner as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The predicates `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `outcome/3` correctly define the game rules.
  - The recursive predicate `play/3` processes lists of moves and computes outcomes accurately.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly accumulates the score based on outcomes (`win`, `lose`, `draw`).
- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.
  - The recursive case processes the head of the list and recurses on the tail, ensuring termination for finite lists.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes outcomes.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Non-list inputs or invalid moves would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth equals the length of the move lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.
