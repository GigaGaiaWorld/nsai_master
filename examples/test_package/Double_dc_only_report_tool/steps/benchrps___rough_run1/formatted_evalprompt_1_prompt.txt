</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, defining the game rules, calculating outcomes, and determining the winner based on a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. The moves `[rock, rock, rock]` vs. `[paper, paper, scissor]` yield:
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: `lose` (paper beats rock)
    - `rock` vs. `paper`: `lose`
    - `rock` vs. `scissor`: `win` (rock beats scissor)
  - The total score is `-1 + -1 + 1 = -1`, so `player2` wins.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The code correctly implements the game logic and computes the winner as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The predicates `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `outcome/3` correctly define the game rules.
  - The recursive predicate `play/3` processes lists of moves and computes outcomes accurately.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly accumulates the score based on outcomes (`win`, `lose`, `draw`).
- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.
  - The recursive case processes the head of the list and recurses on the tail, ensuring termination for finite lists.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes outcomes.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Non-list inputs or invalid moves would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth equals the length of the move lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

**Word Count:** ~350 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and clear.  
**Conclusion:** The code is correct and meets all specified requirements. No failures or improvements are needed for the given test case.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
