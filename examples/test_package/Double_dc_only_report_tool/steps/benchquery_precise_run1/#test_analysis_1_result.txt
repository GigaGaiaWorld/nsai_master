### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid division and decimals, adhering to the requirement of approximating the ratio `D1/D2 < 1.05` using the inequality `20×D1 < 21×D2`. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the logic, testing results, and adherence to requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities, as per the specified inequality.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the inequalities are accurately applied to approximate the density ratio.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the integer population density using floor division (`(P * 100) // A`).  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the two countries are distinct (`C1 \= C2`) and applies the inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1` to approximate the ratio.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the query logic and adheres to the specified requirements.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code handles edge cases such as countries with very low or high population densities (e.g., `mexico` and `ethiopia`).  
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 350 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is logically sound and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified during testing, and the implementation is robust for the given problem. Future enhancements could include extending the database or adding probabilistic features if needed.
