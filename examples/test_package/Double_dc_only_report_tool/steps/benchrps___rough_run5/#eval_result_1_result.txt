  "ErrorSummary": "The play_round/3 predicate lacks mutual exclusivity, leading to invalid probabilities (sum > 1.0). The compute_score/2 predicate assumes deterministic results, which is incorrect for probabilistic reasoning.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Revise play_round/3 to enforce mutual exclusivity using if-then-else or guards:\n   play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :- \n       (beats(P1Move, P2Move) -> Result = win ; \n       (beats(P2Move, P1Move) -> Result = lose ; \n       Result = draw.\n2. Modify compute_score/2 to handle probabilistic results by ensuring probabilities sum to 1.0.",
