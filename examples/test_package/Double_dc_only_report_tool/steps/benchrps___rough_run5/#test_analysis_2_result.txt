### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code defines the rules and logic for a rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the game logic, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 15:62.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `play_round` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `play_round/3`  
  - **Code Block**:  
    ```prolog
    play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :- (beats(P1Move, P2Move) -> Result = win ; beats(P2Move, P1Move) -> Result = lose ; Result = draw).
    ```
  - **Issue**: The syntax for nested conditionals (`->/2`) is incorrect. The parentheses are misplaced, leading to a parsing error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog**:  
  The logical correctness of the game rules (`beats/2`) is sound, but the recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented.  
- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:  
  No probabilistic facts or implications are used in this code, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  The feature is not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (failed due to syntax error).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not a concern here due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `play_round/3`   | Prevents execution of the query | Correct the nested conditional syntax. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs  | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.               |

---

#### **Corrected Code**  
```prolog
play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :-
    (beats(P1Move, P2Move) -> Result = win ;
     beats(P2Move, P1Move) -> Result = lose ;
     Result = draw).
```

---

#### **Conclusion**  
The code fails due to a syntax error in the `play_round` predicate. Once corrected, the logic should work as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
