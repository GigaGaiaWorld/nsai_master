</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the game logic for rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of a round and calculating the overall score of a game. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Test Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],draw) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player1) = 1.0000`  

**Analysis:**  
The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. This indicates a logical error in the implementation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Query:**  
The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` returns invalid probabilities.  

**Error Location:**  
- The issue lies in the `play_round/3` predicate, which does not enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes (win, lose, draw).  
- The `compute_score/2` predicate does not account for the probabilistic nature of the results.  

**Code Block with Error:**  
```prolog
play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :- 
    beats(P1Move, P2Move), Result = win ; 
    beats(P2Move, P1Move), Result = lose ; 
    Result = draw.
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog:**  
- The `play_round/3` predicate uses disjunction (`;`) without ensuring mutual exclusivity, leading to multiple valid outcomes for the same input.  
- The `compute_score/2` predicate assumes deterministic results, which is incorrect for probabilistic reasoning.  

**Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
- The results violate the rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0.  
- The implementation does not handle probabilistic facts or negations correctly.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the logic for determining outcomes is flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to incorrect probability handling.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Non-list inputs are not handled.  
- Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for long move lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `play_round/3` lacks mutual exclusivity | Invalid probabilities           | Use `if-then-else` or guards to enforce exclusivity. |
| 2   | `compute_score/2` assumes determinism  | Incorrect score calculation     | Modify to handle probabilistic results. |
| 3   | Probabilities sum to > 1.0       | Violates probabilistic rules    | Ensure probabilities sum to 1.0.    |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails to meet probabilistic reasoning requirements due to logical errors in outcome determination and probability handling. The suggested fixes include enforcing mutual exclusivity in `play_round/3` and revising `compute_score/2` for probabilistic correctness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
