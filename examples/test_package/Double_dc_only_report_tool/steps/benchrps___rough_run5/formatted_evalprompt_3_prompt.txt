</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the game logic for rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the definition of game rules, the calculation of round results, and the determination of the overall winner. The evaluation also checks for edge cases and potential errors in the code.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
  **Expected Output**: `Winner = player2` (since `paper` beats `rock` twice, and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a net score of -1).  
  **Actual Output**: Error due to an unknown clause for `->/2` at line 15:62.  

**Conclusion**: The test failed due to a syntax error in the `play_round` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate**: `play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result)`  
  **Error Location**: Line 15:62  
  **Issue**: The syntax `->/2` is not correctly interpreted in the current context. The error suggests that the conditional operator `->` is not recognized or improperly used.  

**Code Block with Error**:
```prolog
play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :- (beats(P1Move, P2Move) -> Result = win ; beats(P2Move, P1Move) -> Result = lose ; Result = draw).
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for determining the winner of a round (`play_round`) is conceptually correct but syntactically flawed. The use of nested `->` operators is not supported in this context.  
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`play` and `compute_score`) are correctly defined and terminate as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Context**: The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  

**Suggested Fix**: Replace the nested `->` operators with explicit `if-then-else` conditions or separate clauses for each outcome.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The game rules are correctly defined, but the `play_round` predicate fails due to syntax.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `determine_winner(rock, paper, W)`).  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the simplicity of the game.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `play_round` | Prevents round result calculation | Replace `->` with explicit conditions or separate clauses. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | May cause runtime errors | Add input validation. |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**
The code is conceptually sound but requires minor syntactic corrections to function correctly. The error is localized to the `play_round` predicate, and the fix is straightforward. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the evaluation focuses solely on classical Prolog correctness.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
