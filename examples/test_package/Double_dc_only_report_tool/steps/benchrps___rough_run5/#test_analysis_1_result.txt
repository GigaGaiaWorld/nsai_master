### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the game logic for rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of a round and calculating the overall score of a game. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Test Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],draw) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player1) = 1.0000`  

**Analysis:**  
The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. This indicates a logical error in the implementation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
**Failed Query:**  
The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` returns invalid probabilities.  

**Error Location:**  
- The issue lies in the `play_round/3` predicate, which does not enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes (win, lose, draw).  
- The `compute_score/2` predicate does not account for the probabilistic nature of the results.  

**Code Block with Error:**  
```prolog
play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :- 
    beats(P1Move, P2Move), Result = win ; 
    beats(P2Move, P1Move), Result = lose ; 
    Result = draw.
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog:**  
- The `play_round/3` predicate uses disjunction (`;`) without ensuring mutual exclusivity, leading to multiple valid outcomes for the same input.  
- The `compute_score/2` predicate assumes deterministic results, which is incorrect for probabilistic reasoning.  

**Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
- The results violate the rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0.  
- The implementation does not handle probabilistic facts or negations correctly.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the logic for determining outcomes is flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to incorrect probability handling.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Non-list inputs are not handled.  
- Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for long move lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `play_round/3` lacks mutual exclusivity | Invalid probabilities           | Use `if-then-else` or guards to enforce exclusivity. |
| 2   | `compute_score/2` assumes determinism  | Incorrect score calculation     | Modify to handle probabilistic results. |
| 3   | Probabilities sum to > 1.0       | Violates probabilistic rules    | Ensure probabilities sum to 1.0.    |

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails to meet probabilistic reasoning requirements due to logical errors in outcome determination and probability handling. The suggested fixes include enforcing mutual exclusivity in `play_round/3` and revising `compute_score/2` for probabilistic correctness.
