### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the arrangement of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result:** 
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected arrangement of houses based on the given clues. All constraints are satisfied.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly adheres to all specified rules and constraints. The predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and used.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code is logically sound. All recursive predicates (e.g., `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) terminate correctly, and the constraints are enforced as expected.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required. The result is deterministic (`1.0000`).
- **DeepProbLog Features:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic programming.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The input is always a list of five houses, so non-list inputs are not a concern.
  - Recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) are well-defined and terminate correctly.
  - No undefined predicates or expansion issues.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and meets all specified requirements. The code is logically sound, and the test results confirm the expected arrangement of houses. No issues or failures were detected during the evaluation.
