### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Insertion Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with the requirements (interpretable insertion sort). The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** The test passes as the output matches the expected sorted list.  
- **Verification:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are correctly implemented, and the recursion terminates as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `insertion_sort/2` predicate correctly splits the list into head and tail, recursively sorts the tail, and inserts the head into the sorted tail.  
  - The `insert/3` predicate handles three cases:  
    1. Inserting into an empty list.  
    2. Inserting before an element if `X =< Y`.  
    3. Recursively inserting into the tail if `X > Y`.  
  - **Termination:** The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`[]`).  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior (no probabilistic facts or rules are used).  
  - No probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)`, `P(A⇒B)`) are involved.  

##### **DeepProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements insertion sort.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly (`insertion_sort([], [])`).  
- **Performance:** The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which is typical for insertion sort.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used     | N/A                              | Not applicable for this task.       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation of `insertion_sort/2` is correct and meets the classical reasoning requirements. However, edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, which is acceptable for this task.
