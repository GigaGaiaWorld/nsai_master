### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, defining the rules for moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`), win-lose relationships (`beats/2`), and a scoring mechanism (`compute_score/2`). The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including classical reasoning, recursive termination, and probabilistic compliance (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:  
  `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W).`  
  **Result**:  
  `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`  

- **Verification**:  
  The test passes. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000, as `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a net score of -1 for `player1`.

- **Conclusion**:  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**. The implementation adheres to the rules of rock-paper-scissors and computes the winner accurately.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**.  
  All predicates (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, `determine_winner/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are logically sound. For example, `beats(paper, rock)` correctly reflects the game's win-lose relationships.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly. The base cases (`play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`) ensure termination.

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations. Thus, no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game's rules and computes results.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes valid lists of moves. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms) would cause errors.  
  - **Undefined Moves**: If a move not in `move/1` is provided, the behavior is undefined.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion with large lists could impact performance, but this is unlikely for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is robust for its intended purpose, with no logical or probabilistic flaws. Future enhancements could include input validation and support for probabilistic extensions.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.
