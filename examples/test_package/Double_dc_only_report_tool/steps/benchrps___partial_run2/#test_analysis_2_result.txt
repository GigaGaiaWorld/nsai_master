### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, including the rules of the game, the result computation, and the scoring mechanism. The evaluation also ensures compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result matches the expected outcome (`player2` wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The code correctly implements the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors and computes the game results as expected.  
  - **Predicates Verified**:  
    - `move/1`: Defines valid gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
    - `beats/2`: Defines the win-lose relationships.  
    - `result/3`: Computes the outcome of a single round.  
    - `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Recursively compute the game results and score.  
    - `determine_winner/3`: Determines the winner based on the computed score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `beats/2` and `result/3` correctly model the game's rules.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The `play/3` predicate terminates correctly when the input lists are empty.  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes results.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes valid input lists; undefined behavior for non-list inputs.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.
