### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The contestant then decides whether to switch doors or stay with the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- All probabilities are correct.  
- The results align with the theoretical probabilities of the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, including:  
- Random selection of the prize door (`prize/1`).  
- Host behavior when opening a door (`open_door/1`).  
- Calculation of winning probabilities for both strategies (`win_keep` and `win_switch`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` and `win_switch` are logically sound.  
  - The host opens a door that is neither selected nor contains the prize.  
  - The contestant wins by switching if the prize is behind the remaining unopened door.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate ensures termination for valid inputs.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution of `prize/1` is uniform (`1/3` for each door).  
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+` (negation) complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the host's behavior and contestant choices.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for `win_keep` and `win_switch` are accurate.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid door numbers (1, 2, or 3). Non-list inputs or invalid door numbers are not handled.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Notes:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's requirements. No errors were found, and the probabilistic reasoning is accurate. For future enhancements, consider handling invalid inputs and extending the model to include more doors or additional constraints.
