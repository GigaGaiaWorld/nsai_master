### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [3, 1, 2, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected behavior for each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. The following predicates were verified:
- `stack_op/3` (lines 1–7)
- `get_top_n/4` (lines 8–9)
- `insertion_sort/2` and auxiliary predicates (lines 10–17)

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example:
  - `stack_op(pop, [X|Stack], Stack)` correctly removes the top element.
  - `insertion_sort/2` implements a valid sorting algorithm.
- **Recursive Termination:** All recursive predicates (e.g., `insertion_sort/3`) terminate correctly.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The results are deterministic (probability 1.0000), indicating no probabilistic facts or negations are involved. Thus, no probabilistic rules were violated.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All stack operations behave as expected.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid stack inputs (lists). Non-list inputs may cause errors.
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion in `insertion_sort/2` could be inefficient for large lists.
  - **Sort Operation:** The `sort` operation only sorts the top 3 elements, which may not be intuitive.
