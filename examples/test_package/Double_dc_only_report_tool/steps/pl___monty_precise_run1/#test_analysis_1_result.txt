### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to problem requirements.
- Verification of test results.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities are correct for the Monty Hall problem:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any door (`prize/1`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is 1/3.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is 2/3.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the problem requirements:
- The host opens a door randomly when two empty doors are available (`open_door/1` with probability 0.5).
- The host opens the only empty door with certainty when one empty door exists (`open_door/1` with probability 1).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog:**
- Logical correctness is ensured by:
  - Proper use of `member/2` to enumerate doors.
  - Correct negation (`\+`) to exclude selected or prize-containing doors.
- Recursive termination is guaranteed as `member/2` operates on finite lists.

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**
- The probabilities comply with rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`: Used in `\+ prize(A)` and `\+ select_door(A)`.
  - The host's behavior is correctly modeled with `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)` for fairness.

**DeepProbLog:**  
Not used in this implementation.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `member/2`, negation).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `prize/1`, `open_door/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid door numbers (1, 2, 3). Non-list inputs would fail.
- **Performance:** Recursion depth is minimal (`member/2` operates on a 3-element list).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | None    | N/A    | N/A        |

**Word Count:** ~350 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and concise.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all requirements. No issues were found.
