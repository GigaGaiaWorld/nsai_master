Here's the evaluation report for each code module:

```report
{"HASH": "230CB29D","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```

```report
{"HASH": "B2BAF677","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```

```report
{"HASH": "62B0CEA4","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```

```report
{"HASH": "0F69CE0F","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```

All code modules are functioning correctly as evidenced by the successful test results (all queries returning 1.0000). No regeneration is needed for any of the modules.
