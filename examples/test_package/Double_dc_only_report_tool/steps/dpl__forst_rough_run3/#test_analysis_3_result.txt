### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `sort`, `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation through test results.
- Analyze failures (if any) and identify root causes.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Assess edge cases and overall functionality.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:
- `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000
- `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000

**Conclusion**: All tests failed (probability = 0.0000 for all queries).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
The failures are due to the following issues:
1. **Missing Implementations**:
   - The code only implements the `sort` operation (`stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)`).
   - The predicates for `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` are not defined.

2. **Code Line Numbers**:
   - The `sort` operation is defined in the first block (lines 1â€“10).
   - The missing operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are not implemented anywhere in the code.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Classical ProbLog**:
   - The `sort` operation is logically correct and terminates properly.
   - The recursive `insertion_sort` and `insert` predicates are correctly implemented.

2. **Probabilistic ProbLog**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code.
   - The test results (probability = 0.0000) indicate that the queries are not supported by the current implementation.

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present.
   - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (only `sort` is implemented).
   - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
   - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled.
   - Deep recursion performance is not tested (but `insertion_sort` is correct).
   - Missing operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are a critical oversight.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `push` operation    | Query fails (probability = 0)  | Implement `push` logic.             |
| 2   | Missing `pop` operation     | Query fails (probability = 0)  | Implement `pop` logic.              |
| 3   | Missing `dup` operation     | Query fails (probability = 0)  | Implement `dup` logic.              |
| 4   | Missing `swap` operation    | Query fails (probability = 0)  | Implement `swap` logic.             |
| 5   | Missing `over` operation    | Query fails (probability = 0)  | Implement `over` logic.             |
| 6   | Missing `rot` operation     | Query fails (probability = 0)  | Implement `rot` logic.              |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The code partially meets the requirements but lacks implementations for most stack operations. The `sort` operation is correctly implemented, but the missing operations must be added for full functionality.
