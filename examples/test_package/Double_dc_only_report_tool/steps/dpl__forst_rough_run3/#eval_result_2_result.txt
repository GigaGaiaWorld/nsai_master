  "HASH": "5E40E418",
  "ErrorSummary": "1. Non-list input handling not addressed. 2. `sort` operation undefined for stacks with fewer than 3 elements. 3. Recursive `insertion_sort` may have performance issues for large stacks.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for stack operations (e.g., `is_list(Stack)` checks). 2. Clarify `sort` behavior for small stacks (e.g., handle cases with <3 elements). 3. Optimize `insertion_sort` with tail recursion or iterative methods.",
