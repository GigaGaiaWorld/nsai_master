### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, aiming to reach a target position. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the code, analyzing test results, and identifying potential issues.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a parsing error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1349, in label_tokens
    parser.label_tokens(self.string, self.tokens)
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1186, in label_tokens
    raise ParseError(string, "Expected binary operator", t.location)
problog.parser.ParseError: Expected binary operator at 33:208.
```  
This error suggests a syntax issue in the code, specifically around line 33, column 208.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs during parsing, so no queries were executed.  
- **Specific Issue**: The parser expects a binary operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `>`) but encounters an unexpected token. The problematic line is likely in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.  
- **Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator), 
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength), 
    goal(Target), 
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect), 
    Pos is PrevPos + (Target - PrevPos > 0 ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect.
  ```  
  The ternary operator (`? :`) is not standard in Prolog/ProbLog, which may be the root cause.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for calculating the new flap position is sound, but the syntax is invalid.  
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The probabilistic facts (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined, but the parsing error prevents their evaluation.  
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is used, so the report confirms "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - Classical reasoning: Partially met (syntax error prevents full evaluation).  
  - Probabilistic reasoning: Not evaluated due to parsing error.  
  - Neural network integration: Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The ternary operator is unsupported in ProbLog.  
  - Recursive termination is not verified due to the parsing error.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Invalid ternary operator syntax  | Prevents code execution         | Replace with standard Prolog logic  |
| 2   | Parsing error at line 33         | Halts model evaluation          | Debug and fix the syntax            |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The code contains a critical syntax error due to the use of an unsupported ternary operator. Fixing this issue is necessary before further evaluation of the probabilistic logic can proceed. The report recommends replacing the ternary operator with standard Prolog conditional logic (e.g., `if-then-else`).
