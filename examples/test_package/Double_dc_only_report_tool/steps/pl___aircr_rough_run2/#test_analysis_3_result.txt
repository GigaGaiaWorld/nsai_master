### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to position 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with probabilistic reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` queries over 5 time steps:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - Time 1: 0.2625
  - Time 2: 0.1873
  - Time 3: 0.1269
  - Time 4: 0.0841
  - Time 5: 0.0570

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - Time 1: 0.0000
  - Time 2: 0.0030
  - Time 3: 0.0110
  - Time 4: 0.0127
  - Time 5: 0.0114

**Verification**: All tests pass (no failures). The probabilities align with expected behavior, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but possible.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. All queries return valid probabilities, and the results are consistent with the model's design.
- **Code Verification**:
  - The predicate `attempted_flap_position` (lines 20–25) correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and the previous position.
  - The probabilistic facts (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined and used.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures the system stops attempting moves once the goal is reached.
  - The rules for `flap_position` and `overrun_exception` handle edge cases (e.g., illegal positions) correctly.
- **Probabilistic Compliance**:
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` sum to 1, adhering to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.
  - The conjunction of probabilistic facts (`actuator_strength`, `wind_effect`) is correctly computed.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The code correctly models the flap movement and goal achievement.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and applied.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The system handles illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception`) and ensures termination.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
