<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, aiming to reach a target position. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the code, analyzing test results, and identifying potential issues.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a parsing error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1349, in label_tokens
    parser.label_tokens(self.string, self.tokens)
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1186, in label_tokens
    raise ParseError(string, "Expected binary operator", t.location)
problog.parser.ParseError: Expected binary operator at 33:208.
```  
This error suggests a syntax issue in the code, specifically around line 33, column 208.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs during parsing, so no queries were executed.  
- **Specific Issue**: The parser expects a binary operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `>`) but encounters an unexpected token. The problematic line is likely in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.  
- **Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator), 
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength), 
    goal(Target), 
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect), 
    Pos is PrevPos + (Target - PrevPos > 0 ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect.
  ```  
  The ternary operator (`? :`) is not standard in Prolog/ProbLog, which may be the root cause.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for calculating the new flap position is sound, but the syntax is invalid.  
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The probabilistic facts (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined, but the parsing error prevents their evaluation.  
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is used, so the report confirms "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - Classical reasoning: Partially met (syntax error prevents full evaluation).  
  - Probabilistic reasoning: Not evaluated due to parsing error.  
  - Neural network integration: Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The ternary operator is unsupported in ProbLog.  
  - Recursive termination is not verified due to the parsing error.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Invalid ternary operator syntax  | Prevents code execution         | Replace with standard Prolog logic  |
| 2   | Parsing error at line 33         | Halts model evaluation          | Debug and fix the syntax            |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The code contains a critical syntax error due to the use of an unsupported ternary operator. Fixing this issue is necessary before further evaluation of the probabilistic logic can proceed. The report recommends replacing the ternary operator with standard Prolog conditional logic (e.g., `if-then-else`).  

**Word Count**: ~350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
