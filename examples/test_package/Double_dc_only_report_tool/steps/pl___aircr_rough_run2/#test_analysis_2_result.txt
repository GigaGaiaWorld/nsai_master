### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. It includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap positioning. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to verify logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error for the `->/2` operator at line 33. No queries were successfully executed due to this error.  

**Failed Queries:**  
- `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` could not be evaluated due to the error.  

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**  
- Expected: Successful evaluation of queries with probabilistic results.  
- Actual: Error `UnknownClause` for `->/2`.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** Line 33, column 191.  
- **Predicate/Rule:** The `->/2` operator in the `attempted_flap_position` rule is not recognized.  
- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator), 
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength), 
    goal(Target), 
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect), 
    (Target - PrevPos > 0 -> Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect ; Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `->/2` operator is not a valid Prolog or ProbLog operator. It should be replaced with `if-then-else` logic using `(Condition -> Then ; Else)`.  
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) is correctly implemented.  

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) comply with ProbLog rules.  
  - The negation (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (failed due to syntax error).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for valid clauses.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` or similar predicates are not present.  
  - Non-list inputs are not a concern here.  
  - Deep recursion is avoided by limiting time steps (`at(5)`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| #  | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1  | Invalid `->/2` operator     | Prevents query evaluation       | Replace with `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` syntax. |
| 2  | `UnknownClause` error       | Halts execution                | Fix syntax and re-test.             |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails due to a syntax error in the `attempted_flap_position` rule. Correcting the `->/2` operator will resolve the issue. The probabilistic reasoning and classical logic are otherwise sound. No DeepProbLog features are used.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Fix the syntax error.  
2. Re-run the queries to verify probabilistic results.  
3. Ensure all edge cases are tested.
