<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. It includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap positioning. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to verify logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error for the `->/2` operator at line 33. No queries were successfully executed due to this error.  

**Failed Queries:**  
- `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` could not be evaluated due to the error.  

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**  
- Expected: Successful evaluation of queries with probabilistic results.  
- Actual: Error `UnknownClause` for `->/2`.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** Line 33, column 191.  
- **Predicate/Rule:** The `->/2` operator in the `attempted_flap_position` rule is not recognized.  
- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator), 
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength), 
    goal(Target), 
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect), 
    (Target - PrevPos > 0 -> Pos is PrevPos + Strength + WindEffect ; Pos is PrevPos - Strength + WindEffect).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `->/2` operator is not a valid Prolog or ProbLog operator. It should be replaced with `if-then-else` logic using `(Condition -> Then ; Else)`.  
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) is correctly implemented.  

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (`wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) comply with ProbLog rules.  
  - The negation (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (failed due to syntax error).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for valid clauses.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` or similar predicates are not present.  
  - Non-list inputs are not a concern here.  
  - Deep recursion is avoided by limiting time steps (`at(5)`).  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| #  | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1  | Invalid `->/2` operator     | Prevents query evaluation       | Replace with `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` syntax. |
| 2  | `UnknownClause` error       | Halts execution                | Fix syntax and re-test.             |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails due to a syntax error in the `attempted_flap_position` rule. Correcting the `->/2` operator will resolve the issue. The probabilistic reasoning and classical logic are otherwise sound. No DeepProbLog features are used.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Fix the syntax error.  
2. Re-run the queries to verify probabilistic results.  
3. Ensure all edge cases are tested.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
