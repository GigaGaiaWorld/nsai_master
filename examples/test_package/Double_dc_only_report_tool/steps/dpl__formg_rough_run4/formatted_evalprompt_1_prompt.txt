 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, adhering to classical logic programming principles. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements (interpretable merge sort).
- Analyze edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`.
- **Result**: `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.
- **Conclusion**: The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list.

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The implementation correctly sorts the input list, and the probabilistic result confirms deterministic behavior (as expected in classical Prolog).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. The code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm, and the test case validates its functionality.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates correctly for all cases (empty list, single-element list, and multi-element list).
- **Recursive Termination**: The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) ensure termination, and the recursive calls split the list into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: Not applicable here, as the code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.
- **DeepProbLog Features**: Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements merge sort in classical Prolog.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers) would cause errors.
- **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the first clause of `merge_sort/2`.
- **Single-Element List**: Handled correctly by the second clause of `merge_sort/2`.
- **Performance**: The algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), but deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists (unlikely in typical Prolog implementations).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The merge sort implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical Prolog. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, and edge cases are handled appropriately. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation for non-list inputs and testing with larger datasets to ensure performance robustness. 

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
