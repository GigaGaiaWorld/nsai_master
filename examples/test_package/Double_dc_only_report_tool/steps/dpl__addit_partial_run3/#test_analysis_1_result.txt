### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code defines a simple ProbLog program for digit recognition and addition logic. The program includes facts for digits (`digit/2`) and a rule for addition (`addition/3`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog and DeepProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z))`.  
- **Result**:  
  ```
  addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification**: The result matches the expected output (`5 + 6 = 11`).  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**: All queries returned the correct results with the expected probabilities.  
- **Expansion Predicates**: Not applicable in this code (no expansion predicates like `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc., are used).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `digit/2` facts are correctly defined for images `img_1` to `img_0`.  
  - The `addition/3` rule correctly sums the digits associated with the input images.  
- **Recursive Termination**: Not applicable (no recursion in the provided code).  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts (e.g., `0.7::digit(img_1,1)`).  
  - All facts are deterministic (`P = 1.0000`).  
- **Negations/Implications**: Not used in the code.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Neural Network Calls**: No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used.  
- **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements digit recognition and addition logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: The code does not handle undefined inputs (e.g., `digit(img_10,10)`).  
- **Non-List Inputs**: Not applicable (no list operations).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: Not applicable (no recursion).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic facts used | Limited to deterministic reasoning | Consider adding probabilistic facts for richer modeling. |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features | No neural network integration | Explore `nn/3` for neural-symbolic integration. |
| 3      | Undefined inputs not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add validation for undefined inputs. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code is functionally correct for the given requirements but lacks advanced features like probabilistic reasoning and DeepProbLog integration. Edge cases like undefined inputs should be addressed for robustness.
