### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Density Query Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities (within a 5% margin). The code includes predicates for population (`pop/2`), area (`area/2`), and density calculation (`density/2`). The requirement is to define a query `query_pop/1` to achieve this functionality.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Test Result**: The test failed with the error:  
  ```prolog
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7.
  ```  
  This indicates that the `query_pop/1` predicate is not defined, despite being required by the task.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query_pop(_)`  
  - **Expected**: A list of country pairs with approximately equal population densities.  
  - **Actual**: Error due to undefined predicate.  
- **Code Location**: The error points to line 59, where `query_pop/1` is called but not defined.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `density/2` predicate is correctly defined to calculate population density.  
  - However, the `query_pop/1` predicate, which should use `density/2` to compare densities, is missing.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The `density/2` predicate works, but the `query_pop/1` predicate is missing.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `query_pop/1` is the primary issue.  
  - Non-list input or deep recursion is not relevant here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `query_pop/1` not defined        | Query functionality incomplete  | Define `query_pop/1` to compare densities within 5% margin. |

---

### **Suggested Fix**  
To resolve the issue, define the `query_pop/1` predicate as follows:  
```prolog
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05.
```

This will compare densities of distinct countries and ensure the difference is within 5%.
