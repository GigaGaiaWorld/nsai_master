</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Insertion Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in classical Prolog scenarios, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements (interpretable insertion sort). The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
  - **Verification:** The output matches the expected sorted list.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list as required.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Expansion Predicates:** The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `insertion_sort/2` predicate recursively processes the input list, using the helper predicate `insert/3` to place each element in the correct position within the accumulator (`Acc`).  
  - The base case (`insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc)`) ensures termination when the input list is empty.  
  - The `insert/3` predicate handles three cases:  
    1. Inserting into an empty list.  
    2. Inserting before the head of the list if the element is smaller or equal.  
    3. Recursively inserting into the tail if the element is larger.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the input list is reduced by one element in each recursive call (`[H|T]` becomes `T`).  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  - The implementation meets the requirement of providing an interpretable insertion sort algorithm.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - Not applicable, as the code is purely deterministic.  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  - Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:**  
  - The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  
- **Performance:**  
  - The algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, which is typical for insertion sort.  
- **Undefined Predicates:**  
  - No undefined predicates are used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog features not used | N/A | Not applicable for this task. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation of `insertion_sort/2` is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical Prolog scenarios. However, edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness. The code does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features, which is acceptable given the task's scope.  

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
