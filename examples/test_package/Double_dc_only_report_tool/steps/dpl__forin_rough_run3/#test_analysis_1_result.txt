### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Insertion Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in classical Prolog scenarios, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements (interpretable insertion sort). The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
  - **Verification:** The output matches the expected sorted list.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list as required.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Expansion Predicates:** The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `insertion_sort/2` predicate recursively processes the input list, using the helper predicate `insert/3` to place each element in the correct position within the accumulator (`Acc`).  
  - The base case (`insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc)`) ensures termination when the input list is empty.  
  - The `insert/3` predicate handles three cases:  
    1. Inserting into an empty list.  
    2. Inserting before the head of the list if the element is smaller or equal.  
    3. Recursively inserting into the tail if the element is larger.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the input list is reduced by one element in each recursive call (`[H|T]` becomes `T`).  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  - The implementation meets the requirement of providing an interpretable insertion sort algorithm.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - Not applicable, as the code is purely deterministic.  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  - Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:**  
  - The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  
- **Performance:**  
  - The algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, which is typical for insertion sort.  
- **Undefined Predicates:**  
  - No undefined predicates are used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog features not used | N/A | Not applicable for this task. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation of `insertion_sort/2` is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical Prolog scenarios. However, edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness. The code does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features, which is acceptable given the task's scope.
