### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot interacts with a key, including actions like picking up the key, moving, and dropping it. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code's logical and probabilistic reasoning, ensure compliance with the requirements, and analyze the test results.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4331 |
| `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(robot, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0900 |
| `at(robot, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0100 |
| `at(key, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.5670 |
| `at(key, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4330 |
| `at(key, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key interactions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying(key, s(T))`) terminate correctly.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as the robot failing to move (`goto_fails(T)`) or the key being slippery (`slippery(key, T)`).  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds(T)`, `drop_slippery_key(T)`, and `goto_succeeds(T)` comply with the rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`).  
- **Negation as Failure:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is correctly applied, such as in `drops(key, T)` and `carrying(key, s(T))`.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key interactions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly implemented.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable (no list inputs).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable (limited to `s(s(s(0)))`).
