### Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE` using ProbLog. The puzzle requires that:  
- Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9).  
- The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
- The addition must account for carry-over.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 valid solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`. All solutions returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating certainty.  

**Key Observations:**  
- All solutions satisfy the constraints:  
  - `A`, `B`, and `C` are left digits (non-zero).  
  - All digits in `[A,B,C,D,E]` are unique.  
  - The addition logic (`sumdigit/5`) correctly handles carry-over.  

**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  
- The code adheres to the requirements and produces valid solutions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. However, the following predicates were verified:  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures non-zero first digits.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column addition with carry-over.  

No issues were found in these predicates.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code is logically sound. The recursive `all_different/1` terminates correctly, and the `sumdigit/5` predicate handles all cases (with and without carry).  
- **Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates when the list is empty or when all elements are checked.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. The report confirms:  
  - **"DeepProbLog feature not used."**

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | The code correctly solves the puzzle using deterministic logic.             |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes input is a list of 5 variables. Non-list inputs or lists of incorrect length would fail.  
- **Performance:** The `all_different/1` predicate has a time complexity of O(n²), which is acceptable for small lists (5 digits).
