### Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The puzzle requires:
1. Unique digit assignments (0-9) for each letter.
2. The first digit of multi-digit numbers cannot be zero.
3. Correct arithmetic with carry propagation.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code.
- Analyze the test results.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`. All solutions returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic success. Here are the results:
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly enforces the constraints and arithmetic rules.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The following predicates were verified:
- `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`: Ensure valid digit assignments.
- `all_different/1`: Enforces uniqueness of digit assignments.
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly handles arithmetic and carry propagation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to classical Prolog rules. Recursive predicates (`all_different/1`) terminate correctly.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The results are deterministic (probability `1.0000`), so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not directly applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Classical reasoning: Fully met.
  - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (deterministic results).
  - Neural network integration: Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list input: Not handled (but not required for this problem).
  - Deep recursion: Not an issue due to small input size.
  - Undefined predicates: None detected.
