### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot interacts with a key, including actions like picking up the key, moving to different locations, and handling probabilistic outcomes of these actions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key interactions, including probabilistic outcomes.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying(key,s(T))`) terminate correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code adheres to probabilistic rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`: Demonstrated in `pickup_succeeds(T)` and `pickup_fails(T)`.  
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`: Not explicitly used, but probabilistic facts are correctly defined.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key interactions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. Probabilities for actions (e.g., `pickup_succeeds`, `goto_succeeds`) are correctly computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given scenario.
