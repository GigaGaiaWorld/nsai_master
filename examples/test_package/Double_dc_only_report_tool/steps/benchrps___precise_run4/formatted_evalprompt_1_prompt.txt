<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the game logic, including the determination of winners and the calculation of scores. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning and ensures that the recursive predicates terminate correctly.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating that no clauses were found for an unknown predicate at line 41:77.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
- **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically at the line where the `play/3` predicate is called.
- **Root Cause**: The error suggests that the `play/3` predicate is not correctly defined or called. The issue likely stems from a missing or malformed clause in the `play/3` predicate.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The `play/3` predicate is intended to recursively compare moves and generate results. However, the error indicates that the predicate is not properly defined or called.
- **Recursive Termination**: The base case for `play([], [], [])` is correctly defined, but the recursive case may not be properly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Context**: The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so this aspect is not applicable here.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The code partially meets the requirements but fails due to the undefined `play/3` predicate.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not used in this implementation.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be an issue for large move lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Undefined `play/3` predicate | Test failure | Ensure the `play/3` predicate is correctly defined and called. |
| 2      | Missing error handling for non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for move lists. |
| 3      | No probabilistic reasoning | Limited functionality | Consider extending the game with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix the `play/3` Predicate**: Ensure the recursive case is correctly implemented to handle move comparisons.
2. **Add Input Validation**: Handle cases where inputs are not lists or contain invalid moves.
3. **Extend Functionality**: If probabilistic reasoning is desired, add probabilistic facts to model uncertainty in moves.

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Format**: Markdown with tables and code blocks.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
