### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the logic, test the functionality, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules. The primary focus is on the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which calculates the winner based on two lists of moves.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `determine_winner/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `determine_winner/3`
- **Error Location:** Line 41 (approximate, based on the error message).
- **Issue:** The predicate definition is incomplete or malformed. The error suggests a missing or incorrect operator (`->`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic (win, lose, draw).
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score based on the results.
  - The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, where the conditional logic (`->`) is not properly implemented or is missing clauses.

- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.

- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`). The evaluation is purely classical.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core logic (`result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not an issue due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Malformed `determine_winner/3`   | Predicate fails to execute      | Correct the predicate definition.          |
| 2   | Missing edge case handling       | Undefined behavior for invalid inputs | Add input validation.               |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**
Here is the corrected `determine_winner/3` predicate:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The core logic of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game is sound, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate requires correction. Once fixed, the code will meet all functional requirements for classical reasoning. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
