### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the rules for determining wins/losses/draws, the recursive calculation of results, and the final winner determination. The evaluation focuses on classical ProbLog reasoning and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or predicate definition issue in the `determine_winner` rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `determine_winner/3`  
  - **Location**: Line 41 (approximate, based on error context).  
  - **Issue**: The predicate is not correctly defined or has a syntax error (e.g., missing semicolon or misplaced operator).  
  - **Expected Behavior**: The predicate should call `play/3` and `compute_score/2` to determine the winner based on the results.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Analysis**:  
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are logically correct and terminate properly.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score from the results list.  
  - The error in `determine_winner/3` is likely due to a misplaced or missing operator (e.g., `->` or `;`).  

- **Probabilistic Analysis**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - The code is purely deterministic.  

- **DeepProbLog Analysis**:  
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic (`result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or mismatched list lengths are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner/3` | Predicate fails to execute      | Fix the predicate definition (e.g., correct `->` and `;` usage). |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 3   | No probabilistic features        | Limited to deterministic logic  | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

#### **8. Final Recommendations**  
1. Fix the `determine_winner/3` predicate by ensuring proper syntax and logical flow.  
2. Add input validation for edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs).  
3. If probabilistic reasoning is desired, extend the code with probabilistic facts or rules.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.
