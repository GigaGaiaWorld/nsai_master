  "ErrorSummary": "Malformed conditional logic in `determine_winner/3` predicate causing UnknownClause error",
  "SuggestedFix": "Correct the predicate definition to properly use conditional logic (->/2) and ensure all clauses are properly terminated. The corrected version should be: `determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').`",
