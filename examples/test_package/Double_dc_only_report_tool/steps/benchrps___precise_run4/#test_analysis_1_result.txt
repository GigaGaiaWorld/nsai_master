### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the game logic, including the determination of winners and the calculation of scores. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning and ensures that the recursive predicates terminate correctly.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating that no clauses were found for an unknown predicate at line 41:77.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
- **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically at the line where the `play/3` predicate is called.
- **Root Cause**: The error suggests that the `play/3` predicate is not correctly defined or called. The issue likely stems from a missing or malformed clause in the `play/3` predicate.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The `play/3` predicate is intended to recursively compare moves and generate results. However, the error indicates that the predicate is not properly defined or called.
- **Recursive Termination**: The base case for `play([], [], [])` is correctly defined, but the recursive case may not be properly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Context**: The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so this aspect is not applicable here.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The code partially meets the requirements but fails due to the undefined `play/3` predicate.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not used in this implementation.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be an issue for large move lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Undefined `play/3` predicate | Test failure | Ensure the `play/3` predicate is correctly defined and called. |
| 2      | Missing error handling for non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for move lists. |
| 3      | No probabilistic reasoning | Limited functionality | Consider extending the game with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix the `play/3` Predicate**: Ensure the recursive case is correctly implemented to handle move comparisons.
2. **Add Input Validation**: Handle cases where inputs are not lists or contain invalid moves.
3. **Extend Functionality**: If probabilistic reasoning is desired, add probabilistic facts to model uncertainty in moves.
