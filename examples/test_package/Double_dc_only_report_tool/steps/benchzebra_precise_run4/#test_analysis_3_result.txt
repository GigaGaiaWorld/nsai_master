### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves determining the arrangement of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result:** `zebra(X2) = 0.0000`

**Analysis:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` returns a probability of `0.0000`, indicating that the solver could not find a valid solution that satisfies all the given constraints. This suggests a failure in the logical implementation of the puzzle.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `zebra(Houses)`
  - **Expected Result:** A valid arrangement of houses satisfying all constraints.
  - **Actual Result:** No solution found (`0.0000` probability).

**Specific Issues:**
1. **House Arrangement:**
   - The initial setup of the houses (`houses/1`) is correct, but the constraints may not be properly enforced.
2. **Constraints:**
   - The `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` predicates are defined correctly, but their usage in the main `zebra/1` predicate may not align with the puzzle's requirements.
3. **Missing Constraints:**
   - Some constraints (e.g., the Norwegian living next to the blue house) may not be properly enforced due to incorrect ordering or missing checks.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and terminate properly.
  - The issue lies in the combination of constraints in the `zebra/1` predicate. Some constraints may conflict or be improperly ordered, preventing the solver from finding a valid solution.

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so the failure is purely logical. The `0.0000` result indicates a deterministic failure rather than a probabilistic one.

- **DeepProbLog:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints are logically sound, but their combination fails to produce a valid solution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts used).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Predicates:** None.
  - **Non-list Input:** Not handled, but the input is hardcoded as a list.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to the small problem size.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Constraints not properly combined | No valid solution found         | Reorder or reimplement constraints in `zebra/1` |
| 2   | Missing probabilistic reasoning  | Limited to classical logic      | Add probabilistic facts if needed           |
| 3   | DeepProbLog not used             | No neural integration           | Consider adding neural predicates if required |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The current implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog fails to produce a valid solution due to improper constraint combination. The logical structure is sound, but the constraints need to be re-examined and reordered. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Addressing the constraint issues will likely resolve the failure.
