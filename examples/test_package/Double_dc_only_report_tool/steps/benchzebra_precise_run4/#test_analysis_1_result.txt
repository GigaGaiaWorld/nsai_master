### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code is an implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Identify any logical or syntactic errors.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a `member/2` predicate definition. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at line 4, where the `member/2` predicate is first used.
- **Root Cause:** The `member/2` predicate is not defined in the code, despite being used extensively in the constraints.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented, but the absence of the `member/2` predicate prevents the code from executing.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, and `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and should terminate properly.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents classical reasoning from functioning.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `member/2` predicate is a critical omission.
  - The input format for `houses/1` is correct (a list of 5 houses).

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate | Code cannot execute constraints | Define `member/2` or replace with `my_member/2` |

---

### **Suggested Fix**
Replace all occurrences of `member/2` with `my_member/2` (which is already defined in the code) or define the `member/2` predicate as follows:
```prolog
member(X, [X | _]).
member(X, [_ | Tail]) :- member(X, Tail).
```

After this fix, the code should execute correctly, and the puzzle constraints will be properly enforced.
