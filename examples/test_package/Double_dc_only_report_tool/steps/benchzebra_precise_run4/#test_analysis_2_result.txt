### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the arrangement of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any errors, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a definition for the `member/2` predicate. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Query:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at the first use of `member/2` in the `zebra/1` predicate (line 4).
- **Root Cause:** The `member/2` predicate is used in the code but is not defined. The code includes a custom `my_member/2` predicate, but it is not referenced in the `zebra/1` predicate.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented in the `zebra/1` predicate. However, the absence of the `member/2` predicate disrupts the execution.
- **Recursive Termination:** The custom `my_member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates properly for list inputs.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The puzzle constraints are correctly encoded, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents successful execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic facts.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (reported as "DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `my_member/2` predicate handles non-list inputs gracefully by failing, but this is not a concern for the puzzle's fixed list of houses.
  - No deep recursion issues are present.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `member/2` predicate | Execution fails                  | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` or define `member/2`. |
| 2   | DeepProbLog not used         | No impact on classical reasoning | Not applicable.                     |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace all occurrences of `member/2` with `my_member/2` in the `zebra/1` predicate. For example:
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, spanish, dog, _, _), Houses),
    ...
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The code is logically sound but fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Once this issue is resolved, the puzzle constraints should execute correctly. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the evaluation focuses solely on classical reasoning.
