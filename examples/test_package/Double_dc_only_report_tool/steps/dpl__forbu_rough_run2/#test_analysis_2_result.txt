### Code Evaluation Report: Bubblesort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to sort a list of integers. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, analyzing test results, and identifying potential issues in classical Prolog reasoning.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 14:12.
  ```  
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location**:  
  - The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically in the conditional statement `(Swapped == true -> ...)` at line 14.  
  - The Prolog interpreter does not recognize the `->` operator in this context, likely due to incorrect syntax or missing parentheses.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario**:  
  - The logical correctness of the bubblesort algorithm is compromised due to the incorrect use of the `->` operator.  
  - Recursive termination is not guaranteed because the predicate `bubblesort/3` may not correctly handle the base case or the swapped condition.  

- **ProbLog/DeepProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The code does not use any probabilistic facts, negations, or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - The code fails to meet the classical reasoning requirement due to the syntax error.  
  - No probabilistic or neural network features are implemented.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursive implementation may lead to performance issues for large lists.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: The `->` operator is not correctly defined for the intended use case.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect `->` operator usage    | Syntax error, program failure   | Replace with `if-then-else` or correct Prolog syntax. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.               |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists   | Performance issues              | Optimize or use tail recursion.     |

---

#### **8. Code Corrections**  
Here is the corrected version of the problematic section:  
```prolog
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort([H | T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass([H | T], [], NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped = true ->
        bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
        append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The code contains a critical syntax error in the conditional statement, preventing it from executing correctly. Addressing this issue and handling edge cases will ensure the bubblesort algorithm functions as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.
