### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation with ProbLog Compatibility**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the sorting logic.
- Ensure compatibility with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  **Expected Output**: `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`  
  **Actual Result**: Error (see below).

- **Error Encountered**:
  ```
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 13:12.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code, specifically around line 13.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  **Error Location**: Line 13 (`bubble_pass/4` predicate).  
  **Issue**: The error suggests an invalid or unsupported operator (`->`) in the ProbLog context.

- **Code Block with Error**:
  ```prolog
  bubble_pass([X, Y | T], Acc, NewList, Swapped) :-
      (X > Y ->
          bubble_pass([X | T], [Y | Acc], NewList, true)
      ;
          bubble_pass([Y | T], [X | Acc], NewList, Swapped)
      ).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `->` operator is valid in standard Prolog for conditional branching but is not supported in ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework.
  - The recursive logic in `bubble_pass/4` is correct for sorting, but the conditional operator causes the ProbLog engine to fail.

- **ProbLog Context**:
  - ProbLog does not support the `->` operator for probabilistic facts or rules. This violates the requirement for interpretability in ProbLog.
  - No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used, so the DeepProbLog feature is not utilized.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The sorting logic is correct in Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to unsupported syntax.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to the `->` operator issue.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (reported as "DeepProbLog feature not used").

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for large lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog | ProbLog compatibility failure | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible constructs (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No handling for non-list inputs | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add input validation. |
| 3   | Deep recursion risk | Potential stack overflow | Optimize recursion or use tail recursion. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The code fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->` operator. To fix this:
1. Replace the `->` operator with ProbLog-compatible logic.
2. Add input validation for non-list inputs.
3. Optimize recursion for performance.

**Word Count**: ~450 words.
