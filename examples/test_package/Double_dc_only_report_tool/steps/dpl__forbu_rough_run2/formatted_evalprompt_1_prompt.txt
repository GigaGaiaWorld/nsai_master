 Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 5:22.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog Context**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 5:22.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Error Location**: Line 5, Column 22.
- **Problematic Code**:
  ```prolog
  (Swapped == true ->
      bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
  ;
      append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
  ).
  ```
  The error arises from the misuse of the `->` operator, which is not correctly interpreted in ProbLog.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `->` operator is valid in standard Prolog for conditional branching, but ProbLog does not support it directly.
  - The recursive termination condition (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`) is logically correct, but the conditional branch disrupts the flow.

- **ProbLog Context**:
  - ProbLog requires explicit handling of probabilistic facts and implications. The `->` operator is not part of ProbLog's syntax, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.
  - No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used, so DeepProbLog features are not utilized.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The bubblesort logic is correct, but the conditional branch fails in ProbLog.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to the unsupported `->` operator.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested.
  - The `append/3` predicate is used correctly, but its probabilistic implications are not explored.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog | Conditional branching fails | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`) |
| 2   | No probabilistic facts           | Probabilistic reasoning missing | Add probabilistic facts if required |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features          | Neural integration missing      | Use `nn/3` or `tensor/...` if needed |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The code fails due to the unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog. To fix this, replace the conditional branch with ProbLog-compatible logic. Additionally, ensure the code adheres to ProbLog's syntax and requirements for probabilistic reasoning. No DeepProbLog features are used, so their integration is not required for this task.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
