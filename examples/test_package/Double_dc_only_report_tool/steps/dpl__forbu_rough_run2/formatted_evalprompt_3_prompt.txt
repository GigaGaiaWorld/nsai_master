    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 13:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation with ProbLog Compatibility**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the sorting logic.
- Ensure compatibility with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  **Expected Output**: `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`  
  **Actual Result**: Error (see below).

- **Error Encountered**:
  ```
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 13:12.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code, specifically around line 13.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  **Error Location**: Line 13 (`bubble_pass/4` predicate).  
  **Issue**: The error suggests an invalid or unsupported operator (`->`) in the ProbLog context.

- **Code Block with Error**:
  ```prolog
  bubble_pass([X, Y | T], Acc, NewList, Swapped) :-
      (X > Y ->
          bubble_pass([X | T], [Y | Acc], NewList, true)
      ;
          bubble_pass([Y | T], [X | Acc], NewList, Swapped)
      ).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `->` operator is valid in standard Prolog for conditional branching but is not supported in ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework.
  - The recursive logic in `bubble_pass/4` is correct for sorting, but the conditional operator causes the ProbLog engine to fail.

- **ProbLog Context**:
  - ProbLog does not support the `->` operator for probabilistic facts or rules. This violates the requirement for interpretability in ProbLog.
  - No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used, so the DeepProbLog feature is not utilized.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The sorting logic is correct in Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to unsupported syntax.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to the `->` operator issue.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (reported as "DeepProbLog feature not used").

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for large lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog | ProbLog compatibility failure | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible constructs (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No handling for non-list inputs | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add input validation. |
| 3   | Deep recursion risk | Potential stack overflow | Optimize recursion or use tail recursion. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The code fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->` operator. To fix this:
1. Replace the `->` operator with ProbLog-compatible logic.
2. Add input validation for non-list inputs.
3. Optimize recursion for performance.

**Word Count**: ~450 words.

Let me know if you'd like further refinements or additional details!

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
