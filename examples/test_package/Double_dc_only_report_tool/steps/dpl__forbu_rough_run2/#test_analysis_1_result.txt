### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog Context**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 5:22.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Error Location**: Line 5, Column 22.
- **Problematic Code**:
  ```prolog
  (Swapped == true ->
      bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
  ;
      append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
  ).
  ```
  The error arises from the misuse of the `->` operator, which is not correctly interpreted in ProbLog.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `->` operator is valid in standard Prolog for conditional branching, but ProbLog does not support it directly.
  - The recursive termination condition (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`) is logically correct, but the conditional branch disrupts the flow.

- **ProbLog Context**:
  - ProbLog requires explicit handling of probabilistic facts and implications. The `->` operator is not part of ProbLog's syntax, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.
  - No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used, so DeepProbLog features are not utilized.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The bubblesort logic is correct, but the conditional branch fails in ProbLog.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to the unsupported `->` operator.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested.
  - The `append/3` predicate is used correctly, but its probabilistic implications are not explored.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog | Conditional branching fails | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`) |
| 2   | No probabilistic facts           | Probabilistic reasoning missing | Add probabilistic facts if required |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features          | Neural integration missing      | Use `nn/3` or `tensor/...` if needed |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The code fails due to the unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog. To fix this, replace the conditional branch with ProbLog-compatible logic. Additionally, ensure the code adheres to ProbLog's syntax and requirements for probabilistic reasoning. No DeepProbLog features are used, so their integration is not required for this task.
