</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any errors, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of the `member/2` predicate, which is called in the code but not defined. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is undefined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Location:** Line 4
- **Issue:** The predicate `member/2` is called but not defined in the provided code. The error occurs because ProbLog cannot find any clauses for this predicate.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code lacks the definition of the `member/2` predicate, which is essential for checking membership in the list of houses. This is a classical Prolog/ProbLog predicate and must be defined for the program to function.
- **Recursive Termination:** Not applicable here since the predicate is missing entirely.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The current implementation does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so this aspect is not relevant to the failure.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code structure is correct, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents successful execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not used in this implementation.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The undefined `member/2` predicate is a critical oversight.
  - Non-list input or deep recursion is not tested due to the early failure.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Program fails to execute        | Define the `member/2` predicate or replace it with `my_member/2` (already defined in the code). |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the call to `member/2` with `my_member/2`, which is already defined in the code:
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The primary issue is the missing `member/2` predicate, which halts execution. Once this is resolved, the code should function as intended. No other issues were identified in the provided code. The evaluation highlights the importance of ensuring all required predicates are defined before execution. 

**Word Count:** 350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
