### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any errors, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of the `member/2` predicate, which is called in the code but not defined. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is undefined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Location:** Line 4
- **Issue:** The predicate `member/2` is called but not defined in the provided code. The error occurs because ProbLog cannot find any clauses for this predicate.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code lacks the definition of the `member/2` predicate, which is essential for checking membership in the list of houses. This is a classical Prolog/ProbLog predicate and must be defined for the program to function.
- **Recursive Termination:** Not applicable here since the predicate is missing entirely.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The current implementation does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so this aspect is not relevant to the failure.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code structure is correct, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents successful execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not used in this implementation.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The undefined `member/2` predicate is a critical oversight.
  - Non-list input or deep recursion is not tested due to the early failure.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Program fails to execute        | Define the `member/2` predicate or replace it with `my_member/2` (already defined in the code). |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the call to `member/2` with `my_member/2`, which is already defined in the code:
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The primary issue is the missing `member/2` predicate, which halts execution. Once this is resolved, the code should function as intended. No other issues were identified in the provided code. The evaluation highlights the importance of ensuring all required predicates are defined before execution.
