### Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population density. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid division and decimals, adhering to the requirement of approximating the ratio of densities using inequalities. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, analyzing test results, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities, as per the specified inequalities.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the inequalities used for approximation are logically sound.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The logical correctness of the predicates is verified. The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the integer population density using floor division, and the `query_pop/1` predicate ensures the pairs are distinct and their densities are approximately equal.  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here, as the predicates are non-recursive.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
  - The test results show a probability of `1.0000` for all queries, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - The absence of probabilistic constructs (e.g., `P(¬A)`, `P(A⇒B)`) is noted, as the code is purely classical.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - The feature is not used in this code.  

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the query logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as the code is deterministic.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code handles all provided country data correctly.  
  - Undefined cases (e.g., countries not in the database) are not addressed, but this is outside the scope of the current requirements.
