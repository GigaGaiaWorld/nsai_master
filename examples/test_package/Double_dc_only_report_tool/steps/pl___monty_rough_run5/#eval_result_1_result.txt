{"HASH": "751033ED","ErrorSummary": "The current implementation does not correctly handle the uniform random selection between two available doors (requirement 1) and does not explicitly handle the single available door case (requirement 2)","SuggestedFix": "Modify the open_door/1 predicate to explicitly handle both cases: 1) When there are two available doors, use a probabilistic choice (1/2::open_door(A); 1/2::open_door(B)) 2) When there's only one available door, deterministically open it (open_door(A))","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
