</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the specified requirements. The code should correctly model the behavior of Monty Hall when opening doors based on the player's initial choice and the prize's location.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails during execution with the error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:229.
```  
This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `open_door/1` predicate. No queries were successfully executed due to this failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) fail due to the error in `open_door/1`.  
- **Error Location:** The `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6–229) is malformed. The error suggests a missing or incorrect clause definition.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not comply with the requirements. Specifically:  
    1. The uniform random selection between two doors is not correctly implemented.  
    2. The deterministic opening of a single door is missing.  
  - The predicate uses `findall` and `length` to determine the number of available doors, but the logic for handling the two cases (two doors vs. one door) is flawed.  

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The use of `0.5::open_door(Door)` is incorrect. Probabilistic facts should not be dynamically assigned within a rule.  
  - The negation `\+ prize(Door)` and `\+ (Door = Selected)` must be handled carefully to avoid incorrect probabilistic outcomes.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `member/2` and `select_door/1` predicates are correctly defined, but `open_door/1` fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The dynamic assignment of probabilities violates ProbLog rules.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle cases where the player's initial choice is invalid (e.g., not in [1, 2, 3]).  
  - The recursive `member/2` predicate is correct but could be optimized for performance.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Malformed `open_door/1` predicate | All queries fail                | Rewrite `open_door/1` to comply with the two specified clauses.            |
| 2   | Incorrect probabilistic fact     | Probabilistic reasoning invalid | Replace dynamic `0.5::open_door(Door)` with static probabilistic facts.    |
| 3   | Missing edge case handling       | Potential runtime errors        | Add validation for player's door choice.                                   |

---

**Word Count:** 450  
**Tone:** Formal  
**Logic:** Clear and structured  

--- 

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revision to meet the requirements and pass the tests. Focus on correcting the `open_door/1` predicate and ensuring probabilistic facts are statically defined.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
