  "ErrorSummary": "The 'open_door/1' predicate is malformed and does not comply with the requirements. It incorrectly uses dynamic probabilistic facts and fails to handle the two specified cases (uniform random selection between two doors or deterministic opening of one door).",
  "SuggestedFix": "Rewrite 'open_door/1' as follows:\n1. For the case with two doors (A and B), add a static probabilistic fact: '0.5::open_door(A); 0.5::open_door(B)'.\n2. For the case with one door (A), add a deterministic clause: 'open_door(A) :- ...'.\n3. Remove the dynamic '0.5::open_door(Door)' assignment and ensure the logic correctly identifies the number of available doors.",
