### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The goal is to simulate the scenario where a player selects a door, and the host (Monty) opens another door, revealing no prize. The player then decides whether to switch doors or stay with the initial choice. The code should correctly model the probabilities of winning under both strategies (keeping or switching doors).

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:208.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The error suggests that the query `open_door/1` is not correctly defined or called. No probability results are returned for any of the queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically at line 6 (character 208).  
- **Root Cause:** The predicate `open_door/1` is not correctly defined to handle the two clauses as specified in the requirements. The current implementation attempts to use probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door(Door)`) in a way that is not syntactically valid in ProbLog.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not correctly implement the two clauses for Monty's behavior. The use of `0.5::open_door(Door)` is incorrect because ProbLog does not allow probabilistic facts to be dynamically assigned within a rule.  
  - The predicate should instead use deterministic rules to model Monty's behavior, with probabilities handled externally (e.g., by enumerating possible outcomes).

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The negation `\+ prize(Door)` is correctly used, but the probabilistic handling of the door selection is flawed.  
  - The predicate should ensure that the probabilities of Monty's choices are correctly computed (e.g., uniform distribution between two doors).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `member/2` and `select_door/1` predicates are correctly defined.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The `open_door/1` predicate fails to correctly model the probabilistic behavior of Monty.  
  - **DeepProbLog Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle cases where the player's initial selection is the prize door.  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate may fail if the input is not a valid door number (e.g., non-integer or out-of-range values).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Incorrect `open_door/1` definition | Probabilistic behavior not modeled | Redefine `open_door/1` using deterministic rules and external probability handling. |
| 2   | Dynamic probabilistic fact assignment | Syntax error | Avoid dynamic assignment of probabilistic facts. Use deterministic rules with enumerated outcomes. |
| 3   | Edge cases not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation and handle edge cases (e.g., invalid door numbers). |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revision to correctly model the Monty Hall problem in ProbLog. Focus on redefining the `open_door/1` predicate and ensuring probabilistic rules are correctly applied.
