  "HASH": "751033ED",
  "ErrorSummary": "The `open_door/1` predicate incorrectly uses dynamic probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door(Door)`), which is invalid in ProbLog. It also fails to correctly implement the two clauses for Monty's behavior (uniform random choice between two doors or deterministic choice of one door).",
  "SuggestedFix": "Redefine `open_door/1` using deterministic rules and handle probabilities externally. For example:\n1. Replace `0.5::open_door(Door)` with deterministic rules that enumerate possible outcomes.\n2. Ensure the predicate correctly handles cases where there are two doors (uniform choice) or one door (deterministic choice).\n3. Add input validation for door numbers.",
