### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the specified requirements. The code should correctly model the behavior of Monty Hall when opening doors based on the player's initial choice and the prize's location.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails during execution with the error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:229.
```  
This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `open_door/1` predicate. No queries were successfully executed due to this failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) fail due to the error in `open_door/1`.  
- **Error Location:** The `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6â€“229) is malformed. The error suggests a missing or incorrect clause definition.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not comply with the requirements. Specifically:  
    1. The uniform random selection between two doors is not correctly implemented.  
    2. The deterministic opening of a single door is missing.  
  - The predicate uses `findall` and `length` to determine the number of available doors, but the logic for handling the two cases (two doors vs. one door) is flawed.  

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The use of `0.5::open_door(Door)` is incorrect. Probabilistic facts should not be dynamically assigned within a rule.  
  - The negation `\+ prize(Door)` and `\+ (Door = Selected)` must be handled carefully to avoid incorrect probabilistic outcomes.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `member/2` and `select_door/1` predicates are correctly defined, but `open_door/1` fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The dynamic assignment of probabilities violates ProbLog rules.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle cases where the player's initial choice is invalid (e.g., not in [1, 2, 3]).  
  - The recursive `member/2` predicate is correct but could be optimized for performance.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Malformed `open_door/1` predicate | All queries fail                | Rewrite `open_door/1` to comply with the two specified clauses.            |
| 2   | Incorrect probabilistic fact     | Probabilistic reasoning invalid | Replace dynamic `0.5::open_door(Door)` with static probabilistic facts.    |
| 3   | Missing edge case handling       | Potential runtime errors        | Add validation for player's door choice.                                   |

**Word Count:** 450  
**Tone:** Formal  
**Logic:** Clear and structured

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revision to meet the requirements and pass the tests. Focus on correcting the `open_door/1` predicate and ensuring probabilistic facts are statically defined.
