### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The contestant then decides whether to switch doors or stay with the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- All probabilities are correct. The uniform distribution of `prize/1` and the probabilities for `win_keep` and `win_switch` align with the theoretical solution.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, including:  
- Random selection of the prize door (`prize/1`).  
- Host behavior (`open_door/1`) when both unselected doors are empty.  
- Probabilistic outcomes for `win_keep` and `win_switch`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` and `win_switch` are logically sound. Recursion in `member/2` terminates correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The negation `\+ prize(A)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
  - The host's random choice between two empty doors (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`) complies with probabilistic rules.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. Probabilities align with theoretical expectations.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `select_door(1)` is hardcoded).  
- **Performance:** Recursion in `member/2` is efficient for small lists.
