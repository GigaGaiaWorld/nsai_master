### **Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code models the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the ProbLog implementation, focusing on:
- **Classical reasoning**: Logical rules for door selection and prize placement.
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Handling of probabilistic facts (e.g., `prize/1`).
- **Functional requirements**: Ensuring the host's behavior aligns with the problem's rules (e.g., opening empty doors).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The code fails to execute due to a **ParseError** at line 8, column 29. The error indicates an **operator priority clash**, likely caused by incorrect syntax in the probabilistic rules. No queries were executed successfully.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: None (code did not compile).
- **Error Location**: Line 8, column 29.
- **Problematic Code**:
  ```prolog
  0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
  ```
  The syntax for probabilistic disjunction is incorrect. ProbLog requires explicit separation of probabilistic choices.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The rules for `open_door/1` and `win_keep/0` are logically sound but syntactically flawed.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The error stems from improper use of `::` for probabilistic disjunction. The correct syntax should be:
  ```prolog
  0.5::open_door(A); 0.5::open_door(B) :-
  ```
- **Recursive Termination**: The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates for finite lists.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but syntactically flawed).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Failed due to syntax error.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs to `member/2` are not handled.
  - **Performance**: Recursion depth is manageable for small lists (doors 1â€“3).

| #  | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Operator priority clash  | Code fails to compile           | Fix syntax for probabilistic disjunction.   |
| 2  | Incorrect `::` usage     | Probabilistic rules not applied | Use `0.5::open_door(A); 0.5::open_door(B)`. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix Syntax**: Correct the probabilistic disjunction syntax.
2. **Test Queries**: After fixing, verify:
   - `query(prize(_))`: Expected probabilities for each door.
   - `query(win_keep)` and `query(win_switch)`: Ensure probabilities align with the Monty Hall problem (e.g., `win_switch` should have a 2/3 chance).
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Add guards for non-list inputs to `member/2`.
