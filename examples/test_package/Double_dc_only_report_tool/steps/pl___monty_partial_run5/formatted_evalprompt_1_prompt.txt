</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code models the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the ProbLog implementation, focusing on:
- **Classical reasoning**: Logical rules for door selection and prize placement.
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Handling of probabilistic facts (e.g., `prize/1`).
- **Functional requirements**: Ensuring the host's behavior aligns with the problem's rules (e.g., opening empty doors).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The code fails to execute due to a **ParseError** at line 8, column 29. The error indicates an **operator priority clash**, likely caused by incorrect syntax in the probabilistic rules. No queries were executed successfully.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: None (code did not compile).
- **Error Location**: Line 8, column 29.
- **Problematic Code**:
  ```prolog
  0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
  ```
  The syntax for probabilistic disjunction is incorrect. ProbLog requires explicit separation of probabilistic choices.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The rules for `open_door/1` and `win_keep/0` are logically sound but syntactically flawed.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The error stems from improper use of `::` for probabilistic disjunction. The correct syntax should be:
  ```prolog
  0.5::open_door(A); 0.5::open_door(B) :-
  ```
- **Recursive Termination**: The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates for finite lists.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but syntactically flawed).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Failed due to syntax error.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs to `member/2` are not handled.
  - **Performance**: Recursion depth is manageable for small lists (doors 1–3).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| #  | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Operator priority clash  | Code fails to compile           | Fix syntax for probabilistic disjunction.   |
| 2  | Incorrect `::` usage     | Probabilistic rules not applied | Use `0.5::open_door(A); 0.5::open_door(B)`. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix Syntax**: Correct the probabilistic disjunction syntax.
2. **Test Queries**: After fixing, verify:
   - `query(prize(_))`: Expected probabilities for each door.
   - `query(win_keep)` and `query(win_switch)`: Ensure probabilities align with the Monty Hall problem (e.g., `win_switch` should have a 2/3 chance).
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Add guards for non-list inputs to `member/2`.

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Format**: Markdown with tables and code blocks.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
