### Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Code in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition problem where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The goal is to find unique digit assignments for `A, B, C, D, E` such that the equation holds, with constraints like non-zero leading digits and all digits being distinct. The evaluation ensures the code's correctness, adherence to constraints, and robustness in handling edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results show the following solutions with a probability of `1.0000`:
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9])`
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0])`
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8])`
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1])`
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2])`
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6])`
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8])`
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5])`
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7])`
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9])`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly enforces constraints (non-zero leading digits, unique digits) and computes valid solutions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented:
- `leftdigit/1` ensures non-zero leading digits.
- `sumdigit/5` correctly simulates column addition with carry.
- `all_different/1` enforces uniqueness of digits.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to classical Prolog logic. Recursive predicates (`all_different/1`) terminate correctly.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The results are deterministic (probability `1.0000`), indicating no probabilistic facts or negations are involved. The code does not use DeepProbLog features (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases like non-zero leading digits and uniqueness constraints. No undefined predicates or performance issues were observed.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code solves the cryptoaddition problem with logical constraints.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases well, such as non-zero leading digits and uniqueness. No undefined predicates or non-list inputs were tested.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is robust and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified during evaluation.
