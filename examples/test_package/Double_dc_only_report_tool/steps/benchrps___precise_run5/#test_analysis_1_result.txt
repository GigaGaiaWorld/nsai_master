### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating "No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77."

**Failed Queries**:
1. `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
   - **Expected**: The query should return `Winner = 'Player 2'` because Player 2 wins two rounds (paper beats rock, paper beats rock) and loses one (scissor loses to rock).
   - **Actual**: Error due to missing or incorrect predicate definition.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate**: The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically at line 41.
- **Root Cause**: The predicate `determine_winner/3` is not correctly defined or is missing a clause. The error suggests a syntax or logical issue in the predicate's implementation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate is also correctly implemented, including edge cases for `win`, `lose`, and `draw`.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`), so no probabilistic rules are violated.
- **Recursive Termination**:
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The game logic is correctly implemented for classical reasoning.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this context.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles edge cases like empty lists and draws correctly.
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are not addressed but are not required for this implementation.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing/incorrect predicate      | Query fails to execute          | Correct the `determine_winner/3` predicate definition and ensure it calls `play/3` and `compute_score/2` correctly. |
| 2      | Syntax error in predicate        | Execution halted                | Verify the predicate's syntax and ensure all clauses are properly defined. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
To resolve the error, ensure the `determine_winner/3` predicate is correctly defined as follows:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The implementation is logically sound but fails due to a missing or incorrect predicate definition. Once fixed, the code should pass all tests and correctly determine the winner of the rock-paper-scissors game. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the focus remains on classical reasoning.
