### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the rules for determining wins, losses, and draws, as well as the recursive logic for calculating the overall winner from a list of moves.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:** The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
- **Impact:** The error indicates a syntax or logical issue in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `determine_winner/3`
- **Code Location:** Line 41 (approximate, based on error message).
- **Issue:** The error suggests a missing or malformed clause in the `determine_winner` predicate. The predicate is not correctly defined or called.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score from the results list.
  - The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which is either missing or incorrectly formatted.
- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly terminated with base cases.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core game logic is correct, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs or mismatched move lists are not handled.
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the simplicity of the game.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing or malformed `determine_winner` predicate | Test failure | Correct the predicate definition or ensure it is properly called. |
| 2   | No handling for non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
The `determine_winner` predicate should be defined as follows:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The core logic of the rock-paper-scissors game is correctly implemented, but the `determine_winner` predicate is either missing or incorrectly defined. Fixing this predicate will resolve the test failure. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
