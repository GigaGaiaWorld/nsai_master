### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the logic, test the functionality, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules. The code includes predicates for moves, win-lose relationships, result calculation, and score computation.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `determine_winner/3`
- **Error Location:** Line 41 (approximate)
- **Issue:** The predicate `determine_winner` is incorrectly defined. The error suggests a missing or malformed clause for the `->/2` operator.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score based on the results.
  - The error arises in the `determine_winner` predicate due to improper use of the `->/2` operator or missing clauses.

- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly terminated with base cases (`[]` for `play/3` and `0` for `compute_score/2`).

- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`). The evaluation is purely classical.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core logic (`result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correct, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** Not handled. The code assumes valid lists of moves.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` | Predicate fails to execute      | Correct the `->/2` operator usage or rewrite the predicate. |
| 2   | No probabilistic features used    | Limited to classical reasoning  | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the faulty `determine_winner` predicate with:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The core logic of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game is sound, but the `determine_winner` predicate contains a critical error. Correcting this predicate will resolve the issue. The code does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features or DeepProbLog, limiting its scope to classical reasoning. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
