### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5898`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key interactions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (e.g., `at(key,Pos,0)`).  
- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probability of `pickup_succeeds(T)` (0.7) and `pickup_fails(T)` (0.3) adheres to the rule `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - The probabilities for `drop_slippery_key(T)` and `fumbles_key(T)` are correctly computed.  

##### **DeepProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Neural Network Integration:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key interactions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and applied.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates were found.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given scenario.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 350 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented, and no edge cases were overlooked. No DeepProbLog features are used, but the classical and probabilistic aspects are robust.
