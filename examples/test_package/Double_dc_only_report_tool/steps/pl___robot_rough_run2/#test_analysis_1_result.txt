### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4813`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6300`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3630`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0070`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities derived from the probabilistic rules in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned values consistent with the probabilistic rules and classical logic defined in the code.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `drops/2`, and `at/3` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases and the use of `s(T)` for time steps.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as the key being slippery or the robot failing to move (`goto_fails`).  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds`, `drop_slippery_key`, and `fumbles_key` comply with the rule `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- **Negations:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is correctly applied, e.g., in `drops(key,T) :- \+ slippery(key,T), fumbles_key(T).`  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities are correctly computed and applied.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

**Edge Cases and Performance:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given scenario.  
- **Input Validation:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `do/2` actions are predefined).
