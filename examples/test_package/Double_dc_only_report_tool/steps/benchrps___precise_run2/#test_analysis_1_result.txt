### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze any failures in the test results.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating "No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77."

**Failed Queries**:
1. `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
   - **Expected**: The winner should be determined based on the results of each round.
   - **Actual**: Error due to missing or incorrect predicate definitions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically at line 41.
- **Root Cause**: The predicate `determine_winner/3` is not correctly defined or is missing clauses. The error suggests a syntax or logical issue in the predicate definition.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog**:
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate is also correctly implemented for handling `win`, `lose`, and `draw` scenarios.
  - The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which is either incomplete or incorrectly formatted.

- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
  - **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core game logic (`result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but is unlikely to be an issue given the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing/incorrect `determine_winner/3` | Test failure, unable to determine winner | Correct the predicate definition and ensure it calls `play/3` and `compute_score/2` correctly. |
| 2   | No error handling for non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves`. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix `determine_winner/3`**:
   - Ensure the predicate is correctly defined and calls `play/3` and `compute_score/2` as intended.
   - Example correction:
     ```prolog
     determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
         play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
         compute_score(Results, Score),
         (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
          Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
          Winner = 'Draw').
     ```

2. **Add Input Validation**:
   - Validate that `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).

3. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Test with empty lists, non-list inputs, and invalid moves.

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The core logic is sound, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate needs correction to pass tests. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
