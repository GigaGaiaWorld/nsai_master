### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the logic, test the functionality, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules. The main predicate `determine_winner/3` calculates the winner based on two lists of moves.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**:  
  The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically at the line where the `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are called.  
- **Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
- **Issue**:  
  The error suggests a missing or malformed clause, likely due to incorrect syntax or an undefined predicate.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are logically sound for classical reasoning.  
  - The error arises from the improper handling of the conditional statement (`->/2`) in the `determine_winner/3` predicate.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor`), so probabilistic rules are not applicable here.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic for determining game results is correct, but the final predicate fails due to syntax issues.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not used.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or mismatched move lists are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not a concern here due to the simplicity of the game logic.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner/3` | Prevents execution of the main predicate | Fix the conditional statement syntax. |
| 2   | No probabilistic features used   | Limits functionality           | Consider adding probabilistic rules if needed. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the problematic line in `determine_winner/3` with:  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
```

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The code has logical potential but requires syntax fixes and edge-case handling for robustness.
