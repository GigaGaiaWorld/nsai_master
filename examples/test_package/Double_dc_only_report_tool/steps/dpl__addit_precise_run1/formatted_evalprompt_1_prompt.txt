</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Number Conversion**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to convert a list of images (representing digits) into a numerical value and perform arithmetic operations (e.g., addition) on these values. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the `number/3` and `multi_addition/3` predicates, ensuring they meet the specified requirements and handle edge cases appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], 391) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes, as the result `391` is correct (`79 + 312 = 391`).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The provided test case executes successfully, and the output matches the expected result.  
  - **Predicates Verified**:  
    - `digit/2`: Correctly maps images to digits.  
    - `number/3`: Accurately converts a list of images into a number.  
    - `multi_addition/3`: Correctly sums two numbers derived from image lists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**:  
    - The `number/3` predicate recursively processes the list, accumulating the result by shifting digits left (multiplying by 10) and adding the new digit.  
    - Termination is guaranteed as the base case `number([], Result, Result)` handles empty lists.  
  - **Probabilistic Rules**:  
    - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this code. The evaluation is purely deterministic.  

- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **Neural Network Integration**:  
    - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  
    - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly converts image lists to numbers and performs addition.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid images. Non-list inputs or invalid images would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth equals the length of the input list, which is manageable for typical use cases.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are called.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code is functionally correct for the given requirements and test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs). Future improvements could include input validation and support for probabilistic reasoning if needed.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
