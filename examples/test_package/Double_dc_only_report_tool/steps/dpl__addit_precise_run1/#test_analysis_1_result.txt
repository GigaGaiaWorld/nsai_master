### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Number Conversion**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to convert a list of images (representing digits) into a numerical value and perform arithmetic operations (e.g., addition) on these values. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the `number/3` and `multi_addition/3` predicates, ensuring they meet the specified requirements and handle edge cases appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], 391) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes, as the result `391` is correct (`79 + 312 = 391`).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The provided test case executes successfully, and the output matches the expected result.  
  - **Predicates Verified**:  
    - `digit/2`: Correctly maps images to digits.  
    - `number/3`: Accurately converts a list of images into a number.  
    - `multi_addition/3`: Correctly sums two numbers derived from image lists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**:  
    - The `number/3` predicate recursively processes the list, accumulating the result by shifting digits left (multiplying by 10) and adding the new digit.  
    - Termination is guaranteed as the base case `number([], Result, Result)` handles empty lists.  
  - **Probabilistic Rules**:  
    - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this code. The evaluation is purely deterministic.  

- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **Neural Network Integration**:  
    - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  
    - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly converts image lists to numbers and performs addition.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid images. Non-list inputs or invalid images would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth equals the length of the input list, which is manageable for typical use cases.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are called.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code is functionally correct for the given requirements and test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs). Future improvements could include input validation and support for probabilistic reasoning if needed.
