### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Density Query Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities (within a 5% margin). The code defines a `density/2` predicate to calculate the density and requires the implementation of a `query_pop/1` predicate to perform the query. The test results indicate an error due to the absence of the `query_pop/1` predicate.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Test Result**: Failure  
  - **Error**: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7`  
  - **Impact**: The query cannot be executed because the required predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query_pop(_)`  
  - **Location**: Line 59  
  - **Root Cause**: The predicate `query_pop/1` is not implemented, despite being required by the task.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `density/2` predicate is correctly defined to calculate population density.  
  - The missing `query_pop/1` predicate prevents the query from executing.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code.  
  - The error is purely syntactic (missing predicate).  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) is present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (missing `query_pop/1`).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle edge cases such as undefined countries or division by zero (though the dataset ensures valid inputs).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `query_pop/1` predicate  | Query execution fails           | Implement `query_pop/1` to compare densities within 5% margin. |

---

### **Suggested Fix**  
To resolve the error, implement the `query_pop/1` predicate as follows:

```prolog
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05.
```

This predicate will:  
1. Calculate densities for all countries.  
2. Ensure the countries are distinct.  
3. Check if their densities differ by no more than 5%.
