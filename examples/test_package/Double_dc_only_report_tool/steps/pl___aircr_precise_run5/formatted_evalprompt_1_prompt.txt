 1. Check if the goal has been reached:
 If Old already satisfies goal(Old), no new trial position is calculated.
 
 2.Determine the current actuator and its strength:
 Select actuator A (use_actuator) according to time Time, and get its thrust AS from actuator_strength(A).
 
 3. Calculate the direction and contribution of the actuator
 Take the global target position GP (goal(GP)), and compare the difference direction between GP and Old:
 - If the target is in front of the current direction, AE = +AS; if in the opposite direction, AE = −AS;
 - Specific calculation: AE = sign(GP − Old) × AS.
 
 4. Superimpose wind interference:
 Take the additional effect WE of the wind force on the position at that moment from wind_effect(Time).
 
 Combine the trial position of this step:
 Add the three parts and get the current attempt flapping position Pos. </Requirements></Langda>

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under actuator and wind influences, aiming to reach a target position while avoiding overrun exceptions. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical flow, and adherence to requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` queries over five time steps:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Verification**: All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with expectations, showing decreasing likelihood of reaching the goal over time and minimal overrun exceptions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (lines 20–25).
- `goal_reached/1` (lines 12–14).
- `overrun_exception/1` (lines 15–17).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code correctly handles recursion and termination. For example, `goal_reached` checks if the current position matches the goal before calculating a new position.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` and `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The logic for flap movement and goal checking is sound.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities for wind and actuator selection are correctly modeled.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Undefined `expand/2`: Not used.
  - Non-list input: Not applicable.
  - Recursive performance: Efficient for the given time steps.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

---

**Word Count**: ~350 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and concise.  
**Conclusion**: The code is well-implemented and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
