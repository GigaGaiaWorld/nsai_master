### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under actuator and wind influences, aiming to reach a target position while avoiding overrun exceptions. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical flow, and adherence to requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` queries over five time steps:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Verification**: All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with expectations, showing decreasing likelihood of reaching the goal over time and minimal overrun exceptions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (lines 20–25).
- `goal_reached/1` (lines 12–14).
- `overrun_exception/1` (lines 15–17).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code correctly handles recursion and termination. For example, `goal_reached` checks if the current position matches the goal before calculating a new position.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` and `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The logic for flap movement and goal checking is sound.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities for wind and actuator selection are correctly modeled.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Undefined `expand/2`: Not used.
  - Non-list input: Not applicable.
  - Recursive performance: Efficient for the given time steps.
