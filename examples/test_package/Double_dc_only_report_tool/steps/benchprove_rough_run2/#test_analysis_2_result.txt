### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a basic meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extended with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob))) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (returned `0.0000`).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failures indicate that none of the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) are correctly implemented or invoked.  

- **Specific Issues:**  
  1. **`implies/2`**: The predicate is defined but not integrated into the `prove/1` logic.  
  2. **`opposite/1`**: Not defined in the code.  
  3. **`expand/2`**: Defined but not linked to `prove/1`.  
  4. **`includes/2`**: Not defined.  
  5. **`extend/3`**: Not defined.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `implies/2` predicate is correctly defined (`\+ A; B`), but it is not used in the `prove/1` logic.  
  - Missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) are not implemented.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The `member/2` and `ancestor/2` predicates are correctly defined and terminate properly.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so the probabilistic implications (`P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`) are not tested.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (basic predicates like `member/2` and `ancestor/2` work, but extended predicates are missing or unused).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- Undefined predicates (`includes/2`, `extend/3`) will fail for any input.  
- Non-list inputs for `member/2` or `extend/3` are not handled.  
- Deep recursion (e.g., `ancestor/2` with long chains) is not tested.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `implies/2` not integrated       | Queries fail                    | Add `prove(implies(A,B))` logic     |
| 2   | `opposite/1` not defined         | Queries fail                    | Define `opposite/1`                 |
| 3   | `includes/2` not defined         | Queries fail                    | Define `includes/2`                 |
| 4   | `extend/3` not defined           | Queries fail                    | Define `extend/3`                   |
| 5   | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Probabilistic reasoning missing | Add probabilistic facts/rules       |

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revisions to meet the extended logic processing requirements and probabilistic reasoning capabilities. The missing predicates must be implemented and integrated into the `prove/1` logic.
