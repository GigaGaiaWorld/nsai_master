### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a ProbLog program with extended logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Identify failures and their root causes.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic logic rules.
- Confirm the absence of DeepProbLog features if not used.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 1.0000 (Pass)
2. `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 0.0000 (Fail)
3. `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 0.0000 (Fail)
4. `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` = 0.0000 (Fail)
5. `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` = 0.0000 (Fail)

**Conclusion:** Only one test passed; the remaining four failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query 2:** `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))`
  - **Issue:** The `opposite/1` predicate is not defined in the code.
  - **Code Location:** Missing definition.

- **Failed Query 3:** `prove(expand(double(3),6))`
  - **Issue:** The `expand/2` predicate is defined but not correctly implemented for arithmetic operations.
  - **Code Location:** Lines defining `expand/2`.

- **Failed Query 4:** `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))`
  - **Issue:** The `includes/2` predicate is not defined.
  - **Code Location:** Missing definition.

- **Failed Query 5:** `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))`
  - **Issue:** The `extend/3` predicate is not defined.
  - **Code Location:** Missing definition.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The `implies/2` predicate is correctly implemented, but other predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) are missing or incomplete.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` and `ancestor/2` predicates are correctly implemented and terminate properly.

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (only `implies/2` is correctly implemented).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) cause failures.
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not tested but could be problematic if predicates are not robust.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `opposite/1` not defined         | Fails queries involving negation | Define `opposite(A) :- \+ A.`       |
| 2   | `expand/2` incorrectly implemented | Fails arithmetic queries       | Correct `expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.` |
| 3   | `includes/2` not defined         | Fails list membership queries    | Define `includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).` |
| 4   | `extend/3` not defined           | Fails list extension queries     | Define `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).` |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code requires corrections for missing predicates and logical implementations to pass all tests.
