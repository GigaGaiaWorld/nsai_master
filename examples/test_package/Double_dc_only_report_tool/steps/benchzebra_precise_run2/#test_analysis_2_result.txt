### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on logical consistency, test results, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result:** 
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:** All constraints in the puzzle are satisfied by the output. For example:
  - The Norwegian is in the first house.
  - The green house is to the right of the ivory house.
  - The zebra is owned by the Japanese resident.
  - The water drinker is in the first house.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The output adheres to all specified rules and constraints.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code correctly implements the puzzle's constraints using predicates like `my_member`, `right_of`, and `next_to`. Recursive definitions (e.g., `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) terminate properly.
- **Probabilistic Context:** Not applicable here, as the puzzle is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration is used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code solves the puzzle using logical constraints.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not required for this puzzle.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The `houses/1` predicate ensures the input is a list of 5 houses.
  - **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) are correctly defined.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and concise.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and robust, passing all tests without issues.
