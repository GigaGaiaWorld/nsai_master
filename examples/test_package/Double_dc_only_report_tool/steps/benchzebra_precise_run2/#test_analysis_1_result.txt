### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a `member/2` predicate in the ProbLog environment. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at the first use of `member/2` in the code (line 4).
- **Issue:** The `member/2` predicate is not part of ProbLog's built-in predicates, and the custom definition (`my_member/2`) is not being used in its place.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented, but the code fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate.
- **Recursive Termination:** The custom `my_member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates properly, but it is not being utilized.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The puzzle constraints are correctly encoded, but the failure of `member/2` prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here, as the puzzle is purely deterministic.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** DeepProbLog features are not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `member/2` predicate is a critical oversight. The custom `my_member/2` should replace all instances of `member/2`.
  - The code assumes valid input (a list of houses), but no checks are in place for non-list inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing `member/2` predicate | Execution fails | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` |
| 2   | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for valid input (e.g., list of houses) |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. Replace all instances of `member/2` with the custom `my_member/2` predicate.
2. Add input validation to ensure the input is a list of houses.
3. Test the corrected code to verify all constraints are satisfied.
