### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The contestant then decides whether to switch doors or stay with the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- All probabilities are correct. The results align with the theoretical probabilities of the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door` and `win_switch`/`win_keep` are logically sound.  
  - The `open_door` rules correctly handle cases where one or two doors are available for opening.  
  - The `win_switch` and `win_keep` predicates accurately reflect the contestant's choices.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly implemented and terminates for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` is correct.  
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+` (negation) in `open_door` and `win_switch` complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the Monty Hall scenario.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this code.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list inputs, but the code ensures valid inputs.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to the small problem size.

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Notes:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the requirements. No issues were found during evaluation. The code is a robust representation of the Monty Hall problem in ProbLog.
