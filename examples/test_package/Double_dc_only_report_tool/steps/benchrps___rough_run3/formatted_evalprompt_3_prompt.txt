</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a predicate to determine the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game logic.
- Analyze the test results and identify any failures.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Problog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating `UnknownClause` for the `->/2` operator at line 15:62.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location**: Line 15, where the `->/2` operator is used in the `play_round` predicate.
- **Issue**: The `->/2` operator is not recognized in the ProbLog context, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Context**:
  - The `play_round` predicate uses the `->/2` operator, which is not natively supported in ProbLog. This operator is typically used in Prolog for conditional logic but is not part of ProbLog's standard syntax.
  - The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are logically correct and terminate properly.

- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the code, so probabilistic reasoning compliance is not applicable here.
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The game logic is correctly defined, but the conditional operator `->/2` is not supported.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs or undefined moves.
  - The recursive performance is acceptable for small lists but may face issues with deep recursion for large inputs.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | `->/2` operator not supported    | Conditional logic fails        | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if-then-else`). |
| 2      | No error handling for invalid moves | May crash on invalid input    | Add validation for `move/1` predicates. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. Replace the `->/2` operator with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic.
2. Add input validation for moves to handle edge cases.
3. If probabilistic reasoning is required, extend the code with probabilistic facts or rules.

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

This report provides a clear and structured analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses, along with actionable suggestions for improvement.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
