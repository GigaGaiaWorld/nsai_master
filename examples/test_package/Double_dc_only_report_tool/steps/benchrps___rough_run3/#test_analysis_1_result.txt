### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the game logic for rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of a round and calculating the overall score of a game. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game logic.
- Analyze the test results for accuracy.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided is:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Test Results:**
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],draw) = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player1) = 1.0000`

**Analysis:**
- The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0.
- **Conclusion:** The test results are incorrect. The query should return a single valid outcome with a probability of 1.0.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Root Cause:**
- The `determine_winner/3` predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`). This leads to multiple outcomes being assigned a probability of 1.0 simultaneously.
- **Code Location:** The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically in the disjunctive logic (`;`) used to assign `Winner`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog:**
- The logical correctness of the `play_round/3` and `play/3` predicates is sound. They correctly implement the game rules and recursive termination.
- The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score based on the results of each round.

**Probabilistic ProbLog:**
- The issue arises from the lack of probabilistic constraints in the `determine_winner/3` predicate. The disjunctive logic (`;`) does not account for mutual exclusivity, leading to invalid probability distributions.

**DeepProbLog:**
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used in the code. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The game rules and recursive logic are correctly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The `determine_winner/3` predicate fails to enforce valid probability distributions.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes valid lists of moves. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the move lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Multiple outcomes with P=1.0    | Invalid probability distribution | Modify `determine_winner/3` to enforce mutual exclusivity. |
| 2   | No probabilistic constraints    | Incorrect probabilistic results  | Use probabilistic facts or constraints to ensure valid outcomes. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Verdict:** The code fails the probabilistic reasoning test due to invalid probability distributions in the `determine_winner/3` predicate. The classical reasoning is correct, but the probabilistic aspect requires revision.
