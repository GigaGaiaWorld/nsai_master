### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the game rules, result computation, and error handling. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning and functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```prolog
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 15:62.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed.  
- **Error Location**:  
  The error occurs in the `play_round` predicate, specifically at the line:  
  ```prolog
  play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :- (beats(P1Move, P2Move) -> Result = win; beats(P2Move, P1Move) -> Result = lose; Result = draw).
  ```
  The issue is with the nested `->` operator, which is not correctly parsed or implemented.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  The logical correctness of the `play_round` predicate is flawed due to improper use of the `->` operator. The predicate should be rewritten to avoid nested conditionals.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined and terminate as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  No probabilistic facts or implications are used in this implementation, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The game rules are defined, but the `play_round` predicate fails due to syntax/logical errors.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - The `play_round` predicate fails for undefined moves (e.g., `scissor` instead of `scissors`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Nested `->` operator in `play_round` | Syntax/logical error            | Rewrite `play_round` without nested conditionals. |
| 2   | Undefined move (`scissor`)       | Incorrect game logic            | Correct the move to `scissors`.     |
| 3   | Non-list input handling          | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.               |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code partially meets the requirements but fails due to syntax and logical errors in the `play_round` predicate. Correcting these issues and handling edge cases will ensure robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
