  "ErrorSummary": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate produces invalid probability distributions (multiple outcomes with P=1.0) due to lack of mutual exclusivity enforcement.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify `determine_winner/3` to ensure only one outcome is possible. Replace the disjunctive logic (`;`) with a single conditional check. For example:\n```prolog\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, S),\n    (S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n    ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n    ; Winner = draw\n    ).\n```",
