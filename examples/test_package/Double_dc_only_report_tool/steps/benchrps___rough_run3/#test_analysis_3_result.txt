### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a predicate to determine the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game logic.
- Analyze the test results and identify any failures.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Problog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating `UnknownClause` for the `->/2` operator at line 15:62.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location**: Line 15, where the `->/2` operator is used in the `play_round` predicate.
- **Issue**: The `->/2` operator is not recognized in the ProbLog context, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Context**:
  - The `play_round` predicate uses the `->/2` operator, which is not natively supported in ProbLog. This operator is typically used in Prolog for conditional logic but is not part of ProbLog's standard syntax.
  - The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are logically correct and terminate properly.

- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the code, so probabilistic reasoning compliance is not applicable here.
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The game logic is correctly defined, but the conditional operator `->/2` is not supported.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs or undefined moves.
  - The recursive performance is acceptable for small lists but may face issues with deep recursion for large inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | `->/2` operator not supported    | Conditional logic fails        | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if-then-else`). |
| 2      | No error handling for invalid moves | May crash on invalid input    | Add validation for `move/1` predicates. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. Replace the `->/2` operator with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic.
2. Add input validation for moves to handle edge cases.
3. If probabilistic reasoning is required, extend the code with probabilistic facts or rules.
