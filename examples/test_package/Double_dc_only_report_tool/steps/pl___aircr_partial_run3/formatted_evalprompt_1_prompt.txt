<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog: Functional and Probabilistic Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The system simulates the movement of flaps under varying wind conditions and actuator strengths, with the goal of reaching a target position (`goal(4)`). The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical rules, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` for time steps 1 to 5.  

**Queries and Results:**  
| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system under probabilistic wind and actuator conditions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, including:  
- `flap_position/2` (Line 10-12)  
- `overrun_exception/1` (Line 15-17)  
- `goal_reached/1` (Line 20-22)  
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (Line 25-34)  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `legal_flap_position/1`, `actuator_strength/2`) are correctly defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for flap movement (`attempted_flap_position/2`) and goal checking (`goal_reached/1`) are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as `Time` is bounded by `at(5)`.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind/1` and `wind_effect/2` comply with the rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly models flap movement and goal checking.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for wind and actuator effects are correctly computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | None    | N/A    | N/A        |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

--- 

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the test results confirm the expected behavior. No issues were identified.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
