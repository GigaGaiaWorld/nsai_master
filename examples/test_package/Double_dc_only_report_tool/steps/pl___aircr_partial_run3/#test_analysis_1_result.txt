#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog: Functional and Probabilistic Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The system simulates the movement of flaps under varying wind conditions and actuator strengths, with the goal of reaching a target position (`goal(4)`). The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical rules, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` for time steps 1 to 5.  

**Queries and Results:**  
| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system under probabilistic wind and actuator conditions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, including:  
- `flap_position/2` (Line 10-12)  
- `overrun_exception/1` (Line 15-17)  
- `goal_reached/1` (Line 20-22)  
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (Line 25-34)  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `legal_flap_position/1`, `actuator_strength/2`) are correctly defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for flap movement (`attempted_flap_position/2`) and goal checking (`goal_reached/1`) are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as `Time` is bounded by `at(5)`.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind/1` and `wind_effect/2` comply with the rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly models flap movement and goal checking.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for wind and actuator effects are correctly computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | None    | N/A    | N/A        |

**Word Count:** ~400 words

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the test results confirm the expected behavior. No issues were identified.
