### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test result provided is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification**: The output matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, where all constraints are satisfied.
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly deduces the attributes of the houses based on the given clues.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. All predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the test result aligns with the expected solution.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code uses recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) to enforce spatial and attribute constraints. These predicates are correctly defined and terminate properly.
- **Probabilistic Compliance**: The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required. The result is deterministic (probability = 1.0000).
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) is used. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly solves the puzzle using deterministic logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Predicates**: All predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are defined.
  - **Non-list Input**: The input is hardcoded as a list of houses, so no edge cases arise.
  - **Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and adheres to the requirements of the Zebra Puzzle. No failures or edge cases were identified. The code is concise and leverages recursive predicates effectively. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic constraints or neural network integration if the problem scope expands.
