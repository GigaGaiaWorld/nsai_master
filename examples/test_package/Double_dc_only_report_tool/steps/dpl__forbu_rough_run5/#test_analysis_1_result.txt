### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation with ProbLog Compatibility**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:  
  `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:22.`  
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the conditional statement (`->/2`) used in the `bubblesort/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `bubblesort/3`  
  - **Line Interval**: Lines 4â€“6  
  - **Issue**: The conditional `(Swapped == true -> ... ; ...)` is not correctly interpreted by ProbLog. ProbLog does not support the `->/2` operator in this context.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate uses a conditional (`->/2`) to decide whether to recurse or append the sorted list. While this is valid in standard Prolog, ProbLog requires explicit handling of such conditions.
  - **Recursive Termination**: The recursion is logically correct but fails due to the unsupported operator.

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - The error arises because ProbLog does not recognize the `->/2` operator. ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic rules or facts for conditional logic.
  - **Probabilistic Rules**: No probabilistic facts or implications are used in this code, so the error is purely syntactic.

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Usage**: DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The bubblesort logic is correct in Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to unsupported syntax.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here, as no probabilistic facts or rules are used.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
  - **Performance**: The recursive implementation may face performance issues with large lists due to deep recursion.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator      | ProbLog execution fails         | Replace with explicit `if-then-else` logic  |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Runtime errors for invalid input| Add input validation                        |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists   | Potential stack overflow        | Optimize with tail recursion or iteration   |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the conditional in `bubblesort/3` with explicit logic:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped = true ->
        bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
        append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).
```
**Alternative for ProbLog**:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped = true, bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ; Swapped = false, append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).
```

**Word Count**: ~450 words  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical  
**Conclusion**: The code fails due to ProbLog's unsupported syntax. Addressing the conditional logic and edge cases will ensure compatibility and robustness.
