### Code Evaluation Report: Bubblesort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, with the goal of sorting a list of integers. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, analyzing test results, and identifying potential issues in classical Prolog scenarios.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result**: The test failed with an error:  
  ```  
  Unmatched character '(' at 4:5.  
  ```  
  This indicates a syntax error in the Prolog code, preventing the query from executing.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically in the rule:  
  ```prolog
  (Swapped = true, bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
  ;
  (Swapped = false, append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
  ).
  ```  
  The parentheses are mismatched, causing a syntax error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The logic of the bubblesort algorithm is correctly implemented in the `bubble_pass/3` and `append/3` predicates. However, the syntax error in the `bubblesort/3` predicate prevents the program from running.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursive calls in `bubblesort/3` and `bubble_pass/3` are correctly structured to terminate when the list is sorted or empty.  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - The code meets the classical reasoning requirement for sorting a list but fails due to a syntax error.  
  - Probabilistic reasoning and neural network integration are not applicable here.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly (`bubble_pass([X], [X], false)`).  
  - Non-list inputs are not explicitly checked, which could lead to runtime errors.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Mismatched parentheses in `bubblesort/3` | Syntax error prevents execution | Fix the parentheses in the rule:  
```prolog
(Swapped = true -> bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted) ; append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)).
```  
| 2   | No input validation for non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for list inputs. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The bubblesort implementation is logically correct but contains a critical syntax error. Fixing the parentheses and adding input validation will ensure the program runs as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
