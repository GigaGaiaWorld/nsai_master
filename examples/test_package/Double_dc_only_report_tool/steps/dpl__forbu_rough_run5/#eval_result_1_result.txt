{
  "HASH": "47D659C8",
  "ErrorSummary": "Unsupported '->/2' operator in ProbLog causing execution failure; no handling of non-list inputs; potential stack overflow for large lists due to deep recursion",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the conditional in bubblesort/3 with explicit logic: 'bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :- bubble_pass(List, NewList, Swapped), (Swapped = true, bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted) ; Swapped = false, append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)).' Add input validation for non-list inputs and optimize recursion for large lists.",
