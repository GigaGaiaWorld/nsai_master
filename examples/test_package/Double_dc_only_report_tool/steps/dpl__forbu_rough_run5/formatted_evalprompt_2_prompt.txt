 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Algorithm: Functional and Probabilistic Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided Prolog code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm, which is tested using the predicate `forth_sort/2`. The goal is to verify the correctness of the sorting algorithm and its adherence to the requirements, including classical reasoning and probabilistic inference (if applicable). The evaluation focuses on:
- Test result verification.
- Failure localization (if any).
- Root cause analysis.
- Overall functional and probabilistic compliance.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following test results were provided:
```prolog
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Analysis:**
- The first result (`[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`) is correct and expected.
- The second and third results (`[1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 12]` and `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`) are incorrect for a fully sorted list. These indicate partial sorting or no sorting at all.

**Conclusion:**  
**Tests failed.** The algorithm does not consistently produce the correct sorted output.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Queries:**
1. `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 12])`  
   - **Expected:** `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`  
   - **Actual:** `[1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 12]`  
   - **Issue:** Partial sorting due to incorrect `bubble_pass/3` logic.

2. `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12])`  
   - **Expected:** `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`  
   - **Actual:** `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`  
   - **Issue:** No sorting performed.

**Error Location:**
- The `bubble_pass/3` predicate (lines 2–6) fails to ensure all elements are compared and swapped correctly. Specifically:
  - The recursive case `bubble_pass([X | Rest], [X | NewRest], Swapped)` does not enforce swapping when `X > Y`.
  - The base case `bubble_pass([], [], false)` does not reset the accumulator properly.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `bubble_pass/3` predicate does not guarantee a complete pass over the list to sort all elements. The recursive logic is flawed because it does not always swap adjacent elements when necessary.
- **Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly, but the sorting logic is incomplete.

**ProbLog:**
- The provided code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules. Thus, no probabilistic analysis is required.
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The algorithm sorts some cases but fails for others.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** Not handled (e.g., `forth_sort(3, X)` would fail silently or incorrectly).
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for small lists but may suffer for large inputs due to the inefficiency of bubblesort.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | `bubble_pass/3` does not enforce full sorting | Incorrect output for some inputs | Revise `bubble_pass/3` to ensure all adjacent elements are compared and swapped. |
| 2 | No handling of non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for list type. |
| 3 | Inefficient for large lists | Performance issues | Consider optimizing or using a more efficient sorting algorithm. |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The `bubblesort/3` implementation requires revision to ensure consistent sorting behavior. Edge cases and performance should also be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
