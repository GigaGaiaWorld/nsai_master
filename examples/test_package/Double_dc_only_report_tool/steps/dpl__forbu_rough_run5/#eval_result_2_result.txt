  "HASH": "47D659C8",
  "ErrorSummary": "The `bubble_pass/3` predicate does not enforce full sorting, leading to incorrect outputs for some inputs. The recursive logic fails to ensure all adjacent elements are compared and swapped when necessary.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Revise the `bubble_pass/3` predicate to ensure all adjacent elements are compared and swapped. For example, modify the recursive case to explicitly handle swapping when `X > Y` and ensure the base case resets the accumulator correctly. Line numbers 2-6 in the `bubble_pass/3` definition need correction.",
