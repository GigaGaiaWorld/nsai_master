### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, adhering to classical logic programming principles. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior under test cases, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully, producing the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verification of Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`), so this step is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The implementation correctly follows the merge sort algorithm:  
  1. **Splitting**: The `split/3` predicate divides the list into two halves.  
  2. **Recursive Sorting**: The `merge_sort/2` predicate recursively sorts the sublists.  
  3. **Merging**: The `merge/3` predicate combines the sorted sublists.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination for empty and single-element lists.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in Prolog.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion for large lists may cause stack overflow, but this is inherent to Prolog's execution model.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors             | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow   | Optimize for tail recursion if possible. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, making it a purely classical Prolog program. Addressing the edge cases would enhance its reliability.
