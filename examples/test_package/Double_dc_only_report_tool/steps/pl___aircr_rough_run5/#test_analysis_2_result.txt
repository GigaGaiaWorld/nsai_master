### **Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical flow, and adherence to requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- **Queries and Probabilities:**
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Verification:**
- All queries return valid probabilities, and no inconsistencies are observed.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The code adheres to the requirements, and all predicates are correctly defined.
- **Expansion Predicates:** Not applicable (no expansion predicates like `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc., are used).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The recursive termination is ensured by the condition `Time > 0` and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.
  - The logic for calculating the new flap position (`attempted_flap_position`) correctly incorporates actuator strength, wind effect, and direction.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with the rules of ProbLog (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - The probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` are consistent with the model's assumptions.
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic for flap movement and goal checking is sound.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly implemented.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code handles all inputs within the defined range (`legal_flap_position` ensures validity).
  - **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**
The ProbLog code for the aircraft flap controller is well-designed and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic and logical components are correctly implemented, and the test results confirm the model's validity. No issues or failures were detected during the evaluation.
