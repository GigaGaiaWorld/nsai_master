<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al. (2013). The system simulates the movement of flaps based on actuator strength, wind effects, and a predefined goal position. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code.
- Analyze test results and identify failures.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Highlight edge cases and potential improvements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:14.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The error occurs during the evaluation of the `attempted_flap_position` predicate, specifically at line 41:14. The system cannot find clauses for the `->/2` operator, which is used in the conditional logic of the predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `attempted_flap_position/2`
- **Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
   Time > 0,
   Prev is Time-1,
   flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
   \+ goal_reached(Prev),
   use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
   actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
   wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
   goal(Target),
   Delta is Target - PrevPos,
   ( Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1 ),
   Move is Direction * Strength + WindEffect,
   Pos is PrevPos + Move.
  ```
- **Error Location:** Line 41:14 (conditional `->/2` operator).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The predicate `attempted_flap_position` is logically sound but fails due to a syntax issue with the conditional operator `->/2`. ProbLog may not support this operator directly, or it may require explicit handling.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**
  - The probabilistic facts (`wind/1`, `wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`) are correctly defined and comply with probabilistic rules.
  - The negation (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) is correctly used.
- **DeepProbLog:**
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the conditional operator causes a failure.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. Probabilistic facts and rules are correctly implemented.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The conditional operator `->/2` is not handled properly in ProbLog.
  - The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Conditional operator `->/2` not supported | Code fails to execute | Replace `->/2` with `if/3` or equivalent ProbLog-compatible syntax. |
| 2   | No clauses for `->/2` at runtime | Predicate evaluation halts | Ensure all operators are ProbLog-compatible. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. Replace the `->/2` operator with a ProbLog-compatible conditional construct, such as `if/3`.
2. Test the revised code to ensure all queries (`goal_reached/1`, `overrun_exception/1`) execute without errors.
3. Verify edge cases, such as extreme wind effects or actuator failures, to ensure robustness.

This report provides a clear analysis of the failure, its root cause, and actionable suggestions for improvement. Let me know if you'd like further details or assistance with the fixes!

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
