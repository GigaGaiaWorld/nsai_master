### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the specified requirements. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation and identify any potential issues.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic and correctly set to `1.0000`.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the expected outcomes of the Monty Hall problem.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Uniform Random Selection:** When two doors are available, the `open_door/1` predicate correctly assigns a probability of `0.5` to each door.  
2. **Forced Selection:** When only one door is available, it is opened deterministically.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Logical Correctness:**  
- The `open_door/1` predicate correctly implements the two clauses specified in the requirements.  
- The `member/2` predicate ensures proper traversal of the list of doors.  
- The use of `findall/3` and `length/2` ensures that the conditions for opening a door are met.  

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly defined as `1/3` for each door.  
- The negation (`\+`) and probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door(Door)`) comply with probabilistic rules.  
- The results for `win_keep` and `win_switch` align with the theoretical probabilities (`1/3` and `2/3`, respectively).  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** The implementation correctly handles the logical aspects of the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The probabilities are accurately computed and align with the problem's theoretical outcomes.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The implementation assumes valid inputs (e.g., doors are integers `1`, `2`, or `3`).  
- No performance issues are observed due to the simplicity of the problem.
