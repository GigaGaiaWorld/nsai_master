System: You are a coding assistant. You should use the available tools to complete the task.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.

<Requirements>Define two clauses of open_door/1:
1. If there are two doors A and B, neither of which has a prize, and neither of which is the door chosen by the player, then Monty will open a door uniformly at random between A and B
2. If there is only one door A that has no prize and is not the door chosen by the player, then Monty must open it` </Requirements></Langda>

AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
