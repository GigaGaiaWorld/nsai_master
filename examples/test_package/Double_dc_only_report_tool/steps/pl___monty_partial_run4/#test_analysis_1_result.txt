### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door, and the contestant decides whether to switch or stay.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- All probabilities are correct.  
- The results align with the theoretical probabilities of the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The code correctly implements the requirements:  
1. **Random Door Opening:** When both unselected doors are empty, one is opened randomly (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).  
2. **Deterministic Door Opening:** When one unselected door has no prize, the host opens it (`open_door(A)`).  
3. **Winning Conditions:**  
   - `win_keep` succeeds if the selected door has the prize.  
   - `win_switch` succeeds if the prize is behind the unselected, unopened door.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog:**  
- Logical correctness is ensured by the predicates `member/2` and constraints like `A \= Selected`.  
- Recursive termination is guaranteed as `member/2` operates on finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
- Probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly defined as `1/3`.  
- The negation `\+ prize(A)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- The host's behavior (`open_door`) adheres to the problem's rules.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Not Used:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) is present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable; `member/2` handles lists.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's requirements. No issues were found in classical or probabilistic reasoning. The absence of DeepProbLog features is noted but not required for this problem.
