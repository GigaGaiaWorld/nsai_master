### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code defines a simple ProbLog program for digit recognition and addition logic. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the digit predicates and the addition rule, ensuring that the program meets the specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning and probabilistic correctness, as well as edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(addition(img_5, img_6, Z))`.
- **Result**: `addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000`.
- **Verification**: The result matches the expected output (5 + 6 = 11) with a probability of 1.0000, indicating a deterministic success.

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No Failures Detected**: All predicates and rules function as intended.
- **Verified Predicates**:
  - `digit/2`: Correctly maps images to digits (e.g., `digit(img_5, 5)`).
  - `addition/3`: Correctly computes the sum of two digits (e.g., `addition(img_5, img_6, 11)`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog**:
  - **Logical Correctness**: The `addition` rule is logically sound, as it correctly retrieves the digits associated with the images and computes their sum.
  - **Recursive Termination**: Not applicable here, as the program does not use recursion.
  
- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:
  - **Probabilistic Facts**: The `digit` facts are deterministic (probability 1.0000), so no probabilistic rules (e.g., negation or implication) are involved.
  - **DeepProbLog**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The program correctly performs digit recognition and addition.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable, as the program is deterministic.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The program does not handle cases where `digit/2` is queried with an undefined image (e.g., `digit(img_10, X)`). This could lead to silent failures.
  - **Non-List Input**: Not applicable here, as the program does not process lists.
  - **Performance**: The program is lightweight and does not involve recursion or complex computations.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Undefined image inputs (e.g., `img_10`) | Silent failure | Add validation or default behavior for undefined inputs. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not utilized | Limited functionality | Consider integrating neural networks for probabilistic digit recognition if needed. |
