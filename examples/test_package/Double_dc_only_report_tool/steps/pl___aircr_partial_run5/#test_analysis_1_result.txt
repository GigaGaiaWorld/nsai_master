### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. It includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap positioning. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while avoiding overrun exceptions. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the code and its probabilistic reasoning.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` queries at time steps 1 to 5:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but increase slightly with time.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules are correctly defined, including:
- `flap_position/2` (lines 1-5)
- `overrun_exception/1` (lines 6-8)
- `goal_reached/1` (lines 9-11)
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (lines 12-20)

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code correctly implements the logic for flap movement, actuator selection, and wind effects. Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with ProbLog rules. For example:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is implicitly handled in the `use_actuator` rule.
  - The `wind_effect` probabilities sum to 1 for both weak and strong wind scenarios.
- **DeepProbLog**: No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The code correctly handles deterministic rules like `legal_flap_position`.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined and computed.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles edge cases like `overrun_exception` when the flap position is illegal.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  - Recursive performance is efficient due to the limited time steps (`at(5)`).
