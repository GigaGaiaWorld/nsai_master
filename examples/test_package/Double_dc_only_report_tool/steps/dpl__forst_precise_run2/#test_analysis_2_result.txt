### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations and Custom `sort` Predicate**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a stack in ProbLog with operations like `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and a custom `sort` operation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their test results, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [3, 1, 2, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) function as intended. The custom `sort` operation was not tested in the provided queries, but its implementation appears correct based on the code review.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])` correctly prepends `X` to the stack.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used in the provided predicates, so termination is not an issue.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or implications, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`). **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All stack operations behave as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., `stack_op(push(1), atom, Y)`).  
- **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, etc., may fail if the stack is empty or has insufficient elements.  
- **Performance:** No deep recursion is present, so performance is not a concern.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Untested `sort` operation | Low | Add test cases for `sort`. |
| 2 | No handling of non-list inputs | Medium | Add input validation. |
| 3 | No handling of empty stack | Medium | Add guards for stack size. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:** The code is functionally correct for the tested scenarios. However, additional test cases and input validation would improve robustness. No DeepProbLog features are used.
