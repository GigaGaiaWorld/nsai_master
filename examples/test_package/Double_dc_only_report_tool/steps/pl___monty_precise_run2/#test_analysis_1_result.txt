### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The contestant then decides whether to switch doors or stay with the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- All probabilities are correct. The prize is equally likely behind any door (`1/3`).  
- The contestant initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1) = 1.0`).  
- The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is `1/3`, and by switching (`win_switch`) is `2/3`.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The code adheres to the requirements:  
- The host opens a door randomly when two doors are unselected and empty.  
- The host opens the only empty door when one unselected door contains the prize.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door` correctly handle the two cases:  
  1. Two empty doors: The host chooses one randomly (`0.5` probability for each).  
  2. One empty door: The host opens it with certainty (`1.0` probability).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities comply with the rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`: Used implicitly in `\+ prize(A)`.  
  - `P(A ⇒ B) = P(¬A) + P(A ∧ B)`: Not directly used but logically sound.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- Not used in this implementation.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic correctly models the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures valid lists (`[1,2,3]`).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to small input size.
