### Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE` under the constraints:
1. Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9).
2. The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.
3. The addition must account for carry-over.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.
- Identify edge cases or potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`, all with a probability of `1.0000`. Here are the results:
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The solutions satisfy the constraints and the addition logic.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:
- `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`: Ensure valid digits and no leading zeros.
- `all_different/1`: Ensures uniqueness of digits.
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly handles addition and carry-over.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The predicates `digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, and `all_different/1` are correctly defined and enforce the constraints.
  - The `sumdigit/5` predicate accurately models column-wise addition with carry-over.
  - Recursive termination is ensured in `all_different/1` and `member/2`.

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (digits 0-9). Non-digit inputs would fail.
  - **Performance:** The recursive `all_different/1` could be inefficient for larger lists, but it is acceptable for this problem size.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Verdict:** The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No issues were found.
