  "ErrorSummary": "No valid solutions found for the cryptoaddition puzzle AB + BCD = CDE under the given constraints. The puzzle may be unsolvable or the constraints too restrictive.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Verify the puzzle manually for solvability. 2. If the puzzle is valid, debug the interaction between sumdigit/5 and all_different/1 constraints. 3. Consider relaxing constraints (e.g., allow some digits to repeat if logically permissible).",
