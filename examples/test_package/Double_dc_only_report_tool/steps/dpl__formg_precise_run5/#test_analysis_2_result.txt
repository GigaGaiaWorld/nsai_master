### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements, including classical reasoning and recursive termination.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result**: The test failed with an error:  
  ```  
  Unmatched character ')' at 13:20.  
  ```  
- **Impact**: The error prevents the query from executing, indicating a syntax issue in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location**: The error occurs at line 13, column 20, due to an unmatched closing parenthesis.  
- **Affected Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
      length(List, Len),
      Len > 1,
      split_list(List, Left, Right),
      merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
      merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
      merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)
      ; Sorted = List).
  ```  
- **Issue**: The semicolon (`;`) before `Sorted = List` is misplaced, leading to incorrect Prolog syntax.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The logical structure of the merge sort is correct, but the syntax error disrupts the execution.  
  - Recursive termination is properly handled for base cases (`[]` and `[X]`).  
- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and unrelated to probabilistic reasoning.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The logic for merge sort is correctly implemented (excluding the syntax error).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly.  
  - Non-list inputs are not explicitly checked, which could lead to runtime errors.  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but should be considered for large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unmatched parenthesis    | Prevents query execution        | Fix the misplaced semicolon (`;`) in the `merge_sort` rule. |
| 2   | No probabilistic rules   | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic facts if needed.  |
| 3   | No input validation      | Potential runtime errors        | Add checks for non-list inputs.     |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Correct the `merge_sort` rule by removing the misplaced semicolon:  
```prolog
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    split_list(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).
```

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The code is logically sound but requires a minor syntax fix to execute correctly. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
