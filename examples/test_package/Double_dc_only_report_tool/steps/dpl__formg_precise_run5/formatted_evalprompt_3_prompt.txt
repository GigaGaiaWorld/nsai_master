</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result:** The test failed with an error:  
  ```  
  Unmatched character ')' at 13:20.  
  ```  
  This indicates a syntax error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs at line 13, column 20, due to an unmatched closing parenthesis.  
- **Affected Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
      length(List, Len),
      Len > 1,
      split_list(List, Left, Right),
      merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
      merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
      merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)
      ; Sorted = List).  <!-- Error here -->
  ```  
  The semicolon (`;`) and closing parenthesis are misplaced, causing a syntax error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The logic of the merge sort algorithm is correct, but the syntax error prevents execution.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined, ensuring termination.  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The algorithm meets the requirements for classical reasoning but fails due to a syntax error.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code handles empty and single-element lists correctly.  
  - Non-list inputs are not explicitly checked, which could cause runtime errors.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error: unmatched `)` | Code fails to execute           | Fix the misplaced `;` and `)` in the `merge_sort` rule. |
| 2   | No input validation       | Potential runtime errors        | Add checks for non-list inputs.     |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is logically sound but contains a critical syntax error. Once fixed, the code should pass all tests. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, simplifying the evaluation. Addressing edge cases (e.g., input validation) would further improve robustness.  

**Word Count:** 350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
