System: You are a coding assistant. You could use the available tools to complete the task, you should always use 'get_report_tool' first to gain more information.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog.  Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_format>
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: B56DC140 </HASH>
<Requirements>Should contain following rules:
1.Get the length of the current list, Len, to determine whether to continue splitting.
2.Recursive boundary judgment: Only lists with a length greater than 1 need to be sorted, otherwise they are sorted by default.
3.Split the list into two parts, Left and Right, for subsequent recursive processing. </Requirements></Langda>

merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
        merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
        merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)
    ; Sorted = List).
split_list(List, Left, Right) :-
 length(List, Len),
 Half is Len // 2,
 length(Left, Half),
 append(Left, Right, List).
merge([], List, List).
merge(List, [], List).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H1|Merged]) :-
 H1 =< H2,
 merge(T1, [H2|T2], Merged).
merge([H1|T1], [H2|T2], [H2|Merged]) :-
 H1 > H2,
 merge([H1|T1], T2, Merged).
 
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|R]) :-
 append(T, L2, R).
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
</Regenerate_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed code here
```

AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
