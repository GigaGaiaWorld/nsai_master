### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result:** The test failed with an error:  
  ```  
  Unmatched character ')' at 13:20.  
  ```  
  This indicates a syntax error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs at line 13, column 20, due to an unmatched closing parenthesis.  
- **Affected Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
      length(List, Len),
      Len > 1,
      split_list(List, Left, Right),
      merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
      merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
      merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted)
      ; Sorted = List).  <!-- Error here -->
  ```  
  The semicolon (`;`) and closing parenthesis are misplaced, causing a syntax error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The logic of the merge sort algorithm is correct, but the syntax error prevents execution.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined, ensuring termination.  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The algorithm meets the requirements for classical reasoning but fails due to a syntax error.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code handles empty and single-element lists correctly.  
  - Non-list inputs are not explicitly checked, which could cause runtime errors.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error: unmatched `)` | Code fails to execute           | Fix the misplaced `;` and `)` in the `merge_sort` rule. |
| 2   | No input validation       | Potential runtime errors        | Add checks for non-list inputs.     |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is logically sound but contains a critical syntax error. Once fixed, the code should pass all tests. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, simplifying the evaluation. Addressing edge cases (e.g., input validation) would further improve robustness.
