### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid division and decimals, adhering to the requirement of approximating the ratio `D1/D2 < 1.05`. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the logic, testing results, and adherence to ProbLog principles.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities, as per the specified inequality `20×D1 < 21×D2`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the logic adheres to the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The query `query_pop/1` correctly uses the `density/2` predicate to calculate population densities and applies the inequality constraints to approximate the ratio `D1/D2 < 1.05`.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used in this code, so termination is not an issue.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the logic to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** The predicates `pop/2` and `area/2` are fully defined for all listed countries.  
- **Non-list Input:** The input format for `query_pop/1` is strictly enforced as a list `[C1, D1, C2, D2]`.  
- **Performance:** The code is efficient, with no deep recursion or performance bottlenecks.

**Final Word Count:** ~350 words  

**Tone:** Formal and clear.  

**Conclusion:** The code meets all specified requirements and passes all tests without failures. No further modifications are necessary.
