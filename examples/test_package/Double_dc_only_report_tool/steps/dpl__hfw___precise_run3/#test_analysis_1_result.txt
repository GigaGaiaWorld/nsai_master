### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3]`) into their corresponding numerical results. The code uses predicates like `detect_number`, `detect_operator`, and `parse` to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The query returned `X = 0.0000`, which is incorrect for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`. The expected result should be `-13.6667`.

**Conclusion**: The test failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: The query involving the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` returned an incorrect result.  
- **Root Cause**:  
  - The `parse/2` predicate does not correctly handle operator precedence (e.g., division and multiplication should take precedence over addition and subtraction).  
  - The current implementation processes operators left-to-right without considering precedence rules.  
  - **Code Block**:  
    ```prolog
    parse([N1, + | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), almost_equal(R, N1 + R2).
    ```
    Similar issues exist for other operators (`-`, `*`, `/`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The code fails to account for arithmetic operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluations.  
  - Recursive termination is correct, but the parsing logic is flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this code, so probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are irrelevant here.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code parses expressions but fails to handle operator precedence.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or malformed expressions (e.g., `[image_2, image_plus]`) are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for very long expressions.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong results for expressions   | Implement precedence rules in `parse/2` |
| 2   | No handling of malformed inputs  | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation predicates     |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features          | Limited functionality          | Integrate `nn/3` if needed          |

**Word Count**: ~450 words  

**Final Note**: The code requires revisions to handle operator precedence and edge cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are currently utilized.
