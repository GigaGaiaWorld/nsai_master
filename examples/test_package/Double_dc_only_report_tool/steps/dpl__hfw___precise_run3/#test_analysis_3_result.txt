### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The goal is to ensure the code correctly interprets the images, performs the arithmetic operations, and returns the result with probabilistic accuracy. This report evaluates the code's correctness, robustness, and adherence to ProbLog conventions.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:
  - The query evaluates the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`, which simplifies to `2 / 6 - 14 â‰ˆ -13.6667`.
  - The actual result (`11.6667`) is incorrect.
  - **Conclusion**: The test fails due to an incorrect arithmetic evaluation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The query for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`.
- **Expected Result**: `-13.6667`.
- **Actual Result**: `11.6667`.
- **Error Location**:
  - The error lies in the `parse/2` predicates, specifically in the handling of operator precedence and associativity. The current implementation processes operations left-to-right without considering parentheses or precedence rules.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The `parse/2` predicates do not account for operator precedence (e.g., multiplication before addition). This leads to incorrect evaluation orders.
  - Example: `2 / (3 + 3)` is evaluated as `(2 / 3) + 3` due to left-to-right parsing.
- **Recursive Termination**:
  - The recursion in `parse/2` is correctly implemented and terminates as expected.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code correctly parses and evaluates simple expressions but fails for complex ones due to precedence issues.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs or invalid images are not handled.
  - **Deep Recursion**: No issues observed, but performance could degrade with very long lists.
  - **Operator Precedence**: Incorrectly handled.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect operator precedence | Incorrect arithmetic results   | Implement precedence rules or use parentheses parsing. |
| 2   | No handling of invalid inputs | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation predicates.    |
| 3   | No probabilistic features    | Limited to classical reasoning | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

#### **Final Remarks**
The code requires modifications to handle operator precedence correctly. Implementing a shunting-yard algorithm or similar parsing strategy would resolve the issue. Additionally, input validation and edge-case handling should be added for robustness. The current implementation is limited to classical reasoning and does not leverage ProbLog's probabilistic capabilities.
