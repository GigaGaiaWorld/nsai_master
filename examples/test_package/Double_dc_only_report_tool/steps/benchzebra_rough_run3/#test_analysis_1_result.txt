### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic aspects, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle. All constraints are satisfied, and the probability of the solution is 1.0000, indicating certainty.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly defined for list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly defined using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly defined for positional relationships in lists.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The code adheres to the constraints of the Zebra Puzzle.  
  - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation. The solution is deterministic (probability = 1.0000).  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** None.  
  - **Non-list Input:** Not handled, but the problem context ensures list input.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** Not an issue due to the fixed list size (5 houses).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and meets all specified requirements. The solution is deterministic and adheres to the puzzle's constraints. No edge cases or failures were identified. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic facts or neural network integration if the problem scope expands.
