### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game rules and outcome calculations.
- Ensure the recursive logic for computing scores and determining the winner is accurate.
- Confirm compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
    - Net score: `-1 (Player 2 wins)`.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:
  - `outcome/3`: Lines 8–10.
  - `play/3`: Lines 12–14.
  - `compute_score/2`: Lines 16–19.
  - `determine_winner/3`: Lines 20–24.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `outcome/3` are logically sound.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for finite lists.
- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**
  - No probabilistic facts or implications are used in this code. The result is deterministic (probability `1.0000`).
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The game logic and winner determination are correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input is a list of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Undefined behavior for invalid inputs.
  - **Performance:** Recursive performance is linear with the length of the move lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |
