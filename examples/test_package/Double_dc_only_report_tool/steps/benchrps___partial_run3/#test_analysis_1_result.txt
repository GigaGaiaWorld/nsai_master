### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game logic.
- Ensure the probabilistic and classical reasoning components are correctly implemented.
- Identify any edge cases or potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` loses to `paper` (twice).
    - `rock` beats `scissor` (once).
    - The net score is `-1`, indicating `player2` wins.
  - **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** All predicates and rules function as intended.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, `determine_winner/3`.
- **Edge Cases Checked:**
  - Empty lists (`play([], [], [])`).
  - Draw scenarios (`result(X, X, draw)`).
  - Recursive termination (`compute_score([], 0)`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` correctly model the game's win-lose relationships.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`) ensure termination.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**
  - Not explicitly used in this implementation (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **DeepProbLog:** Feature not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/â€¦` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The game logic is correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not required for this task.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid moves (e.g., `move(fire)`) are not handled. Suggested improvement:
    ```prolog
    valid_move(X) :- move(X).
    ```
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists could be optimized with tail recursion.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime error | Add input validation |
| 2      | Deep recursion | Performance overhead | Use tail recursion |

**Word Count:** 350  
**Tone:** Formal  
**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets the classical reasoning requirements. Minor improvements for edge cases are suggested.
