### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a basic rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:** The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000, which aligns with the game rules (paper beats rock, and scissor beats paper).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No Failures Detected:** The code correctly implements the rules and logic for the rock-paper-scissors game. All predicates (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3`) are defined accurately and function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are logically sound. For example, `beats(paper, rock)` correctly reflects the game's win-lose relationships.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly. The base cases (`play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`) ensure termination.
  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the game's rules and computes results.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog feature not required).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Non-list inputs or invalid moves would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game scenarios.
