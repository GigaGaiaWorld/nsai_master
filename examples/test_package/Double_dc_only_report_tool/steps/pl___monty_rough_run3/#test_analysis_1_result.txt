### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules.
- Verification of test results.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.0000`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.
- `win_keep` matches the theoretical probability (1/3).
- **Failure:** `win_switch` should be 0.6667 (2/3), but the result is 0.0000.

**Conclusion:** The test for `win_switch` fails.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:** `win_switch = 0.0000` (Expected: 0.6667)

**Root Cause:**
- The `open_door/1` predicate does not correctly handle the case where the player switches doors. Specifically, the second clause of `open_door/1` (lines 12â€“18) does not account for the probabilistic choice of doors when switching.

**Code Block with Issue:**
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(Door, [1,2,3]),
    \+ prize(Door),
    \+ (Door = Selected),
    findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(OtherDoor), \+ (OtherDoor = Selected)), Doors),
    length(Doors, 1),
    member(Door, Doors).
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Logical Correctness:**
- The `win_switch` predicate relies on `open_door/1` to exclude doors without prizes. The current implementation incorrectly assumes Monty always opens the only remaining non-prize door, ignoring the probabilistic choice when two doors are available.

**Probabilistic Rules:**
- The negation `\+ open_door(A)` in `win_switch` is not correctly computed. The probability of `win_switch` should account for the remaining doors after Monty's action.

**DeepProbLog:**
- Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `open_door/1` predicate does not fully adhere to the problem's rules.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met. The probabilities for `prize/1` and `win_keep` are correct, but `win_switch` is incorrect.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- The code assumes the player always selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`). This is a simplification but not an error.
- The `findall/3` usage in `open_door/1` could fail if the list of doors is not properly constrained.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `win_switch` returns 0.0000 instead of 0.6667 | Incorrect probability for switching doors | Revise `open_door/1` to handle probabilistic door selection when two non-prize doors are available. |
| 2   | `open_door/1` does not account for uniform random choice | Misleading Monty Hall simulation | Add probabilistic choice in the second clause of `open_door/1`. |

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation requires revision to correctly model the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic nature, particularly for the `win_switch` scenario.
