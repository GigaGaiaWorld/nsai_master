  "ErrorSummary": "The `open_door/1` predicate does not correctly handle the probabilistic choice of doors when two non-prize doors are available, leading to an incorrect `win_switch` probability of 0.0000 instead of 0.6667.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Revise the second clause of `open_door/1` to include probabilistic choice when there are two non-prize doors. Replace the current implementation with:\n\n```prolog\nopen_door(Door) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    member(Door, [1,2,3]),\n    \\+ prize(Door),\n    \\+ (Door = Selected),\n    findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \\+ prize(OtherDoor), \\+ (OtherDoor = Selected)), Doors),\n    length(Doors, 2),\n    member(Door, Doors),\n    0.5::open_door(Door) ; 0.5::open_door(OtherDoor).\n```\n\nThis ensures Monty chooses uniformly at random between the two non-prize doors.",
