</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules.
- Verification of test results.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.0000`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.
- `win_keep` matches the theoretical probability (1/3).
- **Failure:** `win_switch` should be 0.6667 (2/3), but the result is 0.0000.

**Conclusion:** The test for `win_switch` fails.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:** `win_switch = 0.0000` (Expected: 0.6667)

**Root Cause:**
- The `open_door/1` predicate does not correctly handle the case where the player switches doors. Specifically, the second clause of `open_door/1` (lines 12–18) does not account for the probabilistic choice of doors when switching.

**Code Block with Issue:**
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(Door, [1,2,3]),
    \+ prize(Door),
    \+ (Door = Selected),
    findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(OtherDoor), \+ (OtherDoor = Selected)), Doors),
    length(Doors, 1),
    member(Door, Doors).
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Logical Correctness:**
- The `win_switch` predicate relies on `open_door/1` to exclude doors without prizes. The current implementation incorrectly assumes Monty always opens the only remaining non-prize door, ignoring the probabilistic choice when two doors are available.

**Probabilistic Rules:**
- The negation `\+ open_door(A)` in `win_switch` is not correctly computed. The probability of `win_switch` should account for the remaining doors after Monty's action.

**DeepProbLog:**
- Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `open_door/1` predicate does not fully adhere to the problem's rules.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met. The probabilities for `prize/1` and `win_keep` are correct, but `win_switch` is incorrect.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- The code assumes the player always selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`). This is a simplification but not an error.
- The `findall/3` usage in `open_door/1` could fail if the list of doors is not properly constrained.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `win_switch` returns 0.0000 instead of 0.6667 | Incorrect probability for switching doors | Revise `open_door/1` to handle probabilistic door selection when two non-prize doors are available. |
| 2   | `open_door/1` does not account for uniform random choice | Misleading Monty Hall simulation | Add probabilistic choice in the second clause of `open_door/1`. |

---

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation requires revision to correctly model the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic nature, particularly for the `win_switch` scenario.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
