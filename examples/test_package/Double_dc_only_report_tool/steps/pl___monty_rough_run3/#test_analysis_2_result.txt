### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the specified requirements. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation and identify any potential issues.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Clause 1:** Correctly handles the case where two doors are available for Monty to open (uniformly random).  
2. **Clause 2:** Correctly handles the case where only one door is available for Monty to open (deterministic).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `open_door/1`, `win_keep/0`, and `win_switch/0` are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate terminates correctly for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` is correctly defined.  
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+ prize(Door)` and `\+ (Door = Selected)` complies with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic correctly models the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list input, but this is not an issue here.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal and poses no performance risk.
