 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, adhering to the functional requirement of being interpretable. The goal of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`
- **Result**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion**: The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
**Output**: "All tests passed (no failures)."  
**Reason**: The implementation correctly sorts the input list and adheres to the merge sort algorithm's logic.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. The code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm, and the test query yields the expected result.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates correctly for all base cases (empty list and single-element list).
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates as the input list is split into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: Not applicable here, as the code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.
- **DeepProbLog Features**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Performance**: The recursive splitting and merging may face performance issues for very large lists due to stack usage.
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are used in the provided code.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Performance issues | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

#### **Final Remarks**
The merge sort implementation is correct and interpretable for classical Prolog scenarios. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with deep recursion. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.  

**Word Count**: ~350 words.  

--- 

**Code Block for Reference**:
```prolog
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    List = [_, _ | _],
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).
split([], [], []).
split([X], [X], []).
split([X, Y | Rest], [X | Left], [Y | Right]) :-
    split(Rest, Left, Right).
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X | Left], [Y | Right], [X | Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Left, [Y | Right], Merged).
merge([X | Left], [Y | Right], [Y | Merged]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X | Left], Right, Merged).
```

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
