  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core merge sort logic. However, edge cases (non-list inputs) are unhandled, and deep recursion may cause performance issues.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for lists (e.g., `merge_sort(List, _) :- is_list(List), !, fail.`). 2. Consider tail recursion optimization for `merge/3` if performance is critical.",
  "Dependencies": [],
