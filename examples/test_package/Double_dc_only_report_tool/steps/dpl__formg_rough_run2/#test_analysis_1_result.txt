### Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, adhering to the functional requirement of being interpretable. The goal of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`
- **Result**: `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion**: The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
**Output**: "All tests passed (no failures)."  
**Reason**: The implementation correctly sorts the input list and adheres to the merge sort algorithm's logic.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. The code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm, and the test query yields the expected result.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates correctly for all base cases (empty list and single-element list).
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates as the input list is split into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.

##### **ProbLog Analysis**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: Not applicable here, as the code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.
- **DeepProbLog Features**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the merge sort algorithm.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Performance**: The recursive splitting and merging may face performance issues for very large lists due to stack usage.
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are used in the provided code.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Performance issues | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

#### **Final Remarks**
The merge sort implementation is correct and interpretable for classical Prolog scenarios. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with deep recursion. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.  

**Word Count**: ~350 words.

split([X, Y | Rest], [X | Left], [Y | Right]) :-
    split(Rest, Left, Right).
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([X | Left], [Y | Right], [X | Merged]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Left, [Y | Right], Merged).
