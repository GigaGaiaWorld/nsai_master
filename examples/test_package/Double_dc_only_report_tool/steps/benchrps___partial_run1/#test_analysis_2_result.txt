### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic aspects, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
  - `rock` loses to `paper` (twice).
  - `rock` beats `scissor` (once).
  - The net score is negative (`-1`), so `player2` wins.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. All predicates and rules are correctly defined and executed as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The predicates `move/1` and `beats/2` are correctly defined to represent the game's rules.
  - The `result/3` predicate accurately determines the outcome of each round (`win`, `lose`, or `draw`).
  - The recursive `play/3` predicate correctly processes lists of moves and computes results.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate accurately calculates the net score.

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly when the input lists are empty.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock).`), so probabilistic correctness checks (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are not applicable here.

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- The code does not use DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game's logic and computes results as expected.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input lists for `play/3`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Undefined Moves:** If a move not in `{rock, paper, scissor}` is provided, the behavior is undefined.
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation is correct and meets the classical reasoning requirements for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. No failures were detected, and the code is logically sound. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic rules or DeepProbLog integration for advanced scenarios. Ensure input validation to handle edge cases like non-list inputs or undefined moves.
