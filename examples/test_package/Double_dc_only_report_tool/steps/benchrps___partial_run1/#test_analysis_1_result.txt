### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, defining the rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and scoring. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
  - The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).
  - **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** All predicates and rules function as expected.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `move/1`: Correctly defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
  - `beats/2`: Correctly defines win-lose relationships.
  - `result/3`: Correctly calculates game outcomes (`win`, `lose`, `draw`).
  - `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Correctly handle recursion and scoring.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `result/3` and `beats/2` are logically sound.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates terminate correctly for empty lists.
- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.
  - **DeepProbLog:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/â€¦` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes valid input lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Undefined Moves:** If an undefined move is provided, the behavior is undefined.
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion could be an issue for very long lists, but this is unlikely in practice.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Notes**
The implementation is correct and passes all tests. No failures or issues were detected. The code adheres to classical ProbLog reasoning but does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Edge cases like invalid inputs could be addressed for robustness.
