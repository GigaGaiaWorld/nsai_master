### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot interacts with a key, including actions like picking up the key, moving, and dropping it. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key interactions, including probabilistic outcomes.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying(key,s(T))`) terminate correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code adheres to probabilistic rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`: Used in `\+ do(putdown(key),T)` and similar negations.  
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`: Implicitly handled in the probabilistic facts (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`).  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used in this code. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The predicates correctly model the robot's actions and key interactions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules comply with standard probabilistic logic.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given scenario.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. No issues were found during testing or analysis. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented, and the edge cases are adequately handled.
