### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the specified requirements. The code defines the problem's rules and queries the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the door.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities for the Monty Hall problem, where switching doors doubles the chance of winning.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the test results match the theoretical expectations.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `open_door/1` predicate correctly implements the two clauses:  
  1. Randomly opens one of two non-prize, non-selected doors.  
  2. Opens the only non-prize, non-selected door if only one exists.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` is correctly defined.  
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation `\+ prize(X)` and implications in `win_switch` comply with probabilistic rules.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used in this implementation.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules for door selection and prize distribution are logically sound.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for `win_keep` and `win_switch` are correctly computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., doors 1, 2, or 3). Non-list inputs or invalid door numbers are not handled.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The `member/2` predicate is efficient for small lists but could be problematic for very large lists.

|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic rules. No failures were detected, and the code meets all specified requirements. Future improvements could include handling edge cases like invalid inputs.
