### Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The solution must satisfy constraints such as unique digits and no leading zeros. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided include 10 valid solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`. All solutions returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating certainty. Here are the results:

```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly generates valid solutions for the cryptoaddition puzzle.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules are correctly defined and executed as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - The code adheres to logical correctness. The recursive predicate `all_different/1` ensures uniqueness of digits, and the `sumdigit/5` predicate correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry.
  - Recursive termination is ensured in `all_different/1` and `member/2` predicates.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required. The results are deterministic (probability `1.0000`).

- **DeepProbLog:**
  - The code does not use neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle using classical Prolog constraints.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes list input for `query_sum/1`. No handling for non-list inputs is provided, but this is not a requirement.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal (maximum 5 digits), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Summary:** The code is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified.
