    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulating the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads observed. The code uses recursive logic to achieve this. However, the test results indicate an error related to non-ground probabilistic clauses.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).`
- **Result:** The test failed with the error:
  ```
  NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```
- **Expected Behavior:** The code should successfully simulate tossing 4 coins and return the total number of heads.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `total(S)`
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `coin(C)` predicate, specifically at line 1:5.
- **Root Cause:** The predicate `coin(C)` is defined as `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`, but `make_coin/2` is not properly defined or grounded. This leads to a non-ground probabilistic clause error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The recursive logic in `coins_r/3` is correctly structured for classical reasoning, but the termination condition (`CNT > 0`) is not the issue.
  - The error arises because `make_coin/2` is not defined, violating the requirement for grounded probabilistic facts.
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**
  - The code does not comply with ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must be grounded (i.e., `make_coin(C,0.8)` must be replaced with a grounded fact like `0.8::coin(head).`).
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the base predicate is flawed).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground clause error.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code does not handle cases where `CNT` is zero or negative gracefully.
  - The undefined `make_coin/2` predicate is a critical oversight.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic clause (`make_coin/2` not defined) | Code fails to execute | Replace `make_coin(C,0.8)` with a grounded probabilistic fact (e.g., `0.8::coin(head).`). |
| 2      | No handling for `CNT <= 0` | Potential runtime errors | Add a guard clause to handle non-positive `CNT` values. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**
```prolog
0.8::coin(head).
0.2::coin(tail).

coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(C),
    (C == head -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC is SC),
    NCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC, S, NCNT).

total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The original code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic clause. The corrected version addresses this by grounding the probabilistic fact and ensuring proper handling of edge cases. The functional requirements for classical reasoning are now met, but the code does not utilize DeepProbLog features. Future improvements could include more robust error handling and validation of input parameters.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
