 1. Check if the goal has been reached:
 If Old already satisfies goal(Old), no new trial position is calculated.
 
 2.Determine the current actuator and its strength:
 Select actuator A (use_actuator) according to time Time, and get its thrust AS from actuator_strength(A).
 
 3. Calculate the direction and contribution of the actuator
 Take the global target position GP (goal(GP)), and compare the difference direction between GP and Old:
 - If the target is in front of the current direction, AE = +AS; if in the opposite direction, AE = −AS;
 - Specific calculation: AE = sign(GP − Old) × AS.
 
 4. Superimpose wind interference:
 Take the additional effect WE of the wind force on the position at that moment from wind_effect(Time).
 
 Combine the trial position of this step:
 Add the three parts and get the current attempt flapping position Pos. </Requirements></Langda>

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, aiming to reach a target position while avoiding overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with probabilistic logic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for time steps 1 to 5:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The results align with expectations, showing decreasing probabilities of reaching the goal over time and minimal overrun exceptions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:
- `legal_flap_position/1`
- `actuator_strength/2`
- `use_actuator/2`
- `wind_effect/2`
- `flap_position/2`
- `overrun_exception/1`
- `goal_reached/1`

The code block for `attempted_flap_position` (Hash: `064BF451`) adheres to the requirements, ensuring correct actuator selection, wind effect application, and goal verification.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures no unnecessary calculations once the goal is reached.
  - The probabilistic facts (`wind/1`, `wind_effect/2`) comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).

- **Probabilistic Compliance**:  
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` are correctly weighted (e.g., `0.25::wind_effect(T,-1)` for weak wind).
  - The actuator selection (`0.5::use_actuator(T,a)`) follows uniform distribution.

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The code correctly models the flap movement and goal verification.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities for wind and actuator selection are correctly implemented.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Undefined `expand/2`: Not applicable.
  - Non-list input: Not relevant here.
  - Deep recursive performance: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The code is well-structured, logically sound, and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified.

--- 

**Word Count**: 450 words.

This report confirms the correctness and robustness of the ProbLog implementation for the aircraft flap controller.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
