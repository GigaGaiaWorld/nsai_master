### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, aiming to reach a target position while avoiding overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with probabilistic logic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for time steps 1 to 5:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The results align with expectations, showing decreasing probabilities of reaching the goal over time and minimal overrun exceptions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:
- `legal_flap_position/1`
- `actuator_strength/2`
- `use_actuator/2`
- `wind_effect/2`
- `flap_position/2`
- `overrun_exception/1`
- `goal_reached/1`

The code block for `attempted_flap_position` (Hash: `064BF451`) adheres to the requirements, ensuring correct actuator selection, wind effect application, and goal verification.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures no unnecessary calculations once the goal is reached.
  - The probabilistic facts (`wind/1`, `wind_effect/2`) comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).

- **Probabilistic Compliance**:  
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` are correctly weighted (e.g., `0.25::wind_effect(T,-1)` for weak wind).
  - The actuator selection (`0.5::use_actuator(T,a)`) follows uniform distribution.

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The code correctly models the flap movement and goal verification.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities for wind and actuator selection are correctly implemented.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Undefined `expand/2`: Not applicable.
  - Non-list input: Not relevant here.
  - Deep recursive performance: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The code is well-structured, logically sound, and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified.
