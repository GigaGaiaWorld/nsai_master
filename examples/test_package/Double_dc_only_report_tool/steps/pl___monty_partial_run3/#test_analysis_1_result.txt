### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to problem requirements.
- Verification of test results.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities are consistent with the expected behavior of the Monty Hall problem.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Random selection of doors (`prize/1`).
- Host behavior (`open_door/1`).
- Winning conditions (`win_keep`, `win_switch`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` and winning conditions are logically sound.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate terminates correctly for finite lists.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1); 1/3::prize(2); 1/3::prize(3)` is correct.
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+ prize(A)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.

**DeepProbLog:**
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used.
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list inputs, but the code ensures valid inputs.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and concise.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all requirements. No issues were found.
