    raise UnmatchedCharacter(string, expr_stack[-1].start.location)
problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character '(' at 8:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code simulates a series of coin tosses using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The goal is to count the number of successful outcomes (heads) over a fixed number of trials (4 tosses). The code uses recursion to decrement the counter and accumulate successes. The evaluation focuses on:
- Correctness of the logic and recursion.
- Compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules.
- Handling of edge cases and termination conditions.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to a syntax error:
- **Error:** `Unmatched character '(' at 8:5.`
- **Impact:** The code fails to execute, preventing any query results.

**Failed Queries:**
- `query(total(_))` could not be evaluated due to the syntax error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location:** The error occurs at line 8, column 5, in the recursive rule `coins_r/3`.
- **Problematic Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  CNT1 is CNT - 1,
      (coin(CNT), SC1 is SC + 1, coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1) ;
      (\+ coin(CNT), coins_r(SC, S, CNT1)).
  ```
- **Issue:** The parentheses are mismatched or improperly nested, causing a parsing error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic is sound in theory but fails due to syntax.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code defines `coin(C)` with a probability of 0.8, but the error prevents evaluation of probabilistic outcomes.
- **Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT` reaches 0, but the syntax error halts execution prematurely.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Not met due to syntax error.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not evaluated.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined `expand/2` or similar predicates are not present.
  - Non-list input is not a concern here.
  - Deep recursion is handled correctly in the logic but not tested due to the error.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Syntax error: Unmatched '(' | Code fails to execute | Fix parentheses in the recursive rule. |
| 2      | Probabilistic evaluation not tested | Incomplete validation | Correct syntax and re-run tests. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix Syntax:** Correct the parentheses in the recursive rule.
2. **Re-test:** After fixing, verify the probabilistic outcomes for `query(total(_))`.
3. **Edge Case Testing:** Ensure the code handles edge cases like `CNT = 0` and invalid inputs.

---

**Word Count:** 350  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Format:** Markdown with tables and code blocks.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
