### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss scenario where a counter `CNT` decrements from 4 to 0. For each decrement, the code checks if the `CNT`th coin toss results in heads (with a probability of 0.8) and increments a success counter `SC` accordingly. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the logical and probabilistic correctness of the code and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Result:** The test failed with the error: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16`.

**Failed Queries:**
1. `query(total(_))`  
   - **Expected:** A probabilistic result for the total number of successful coin tosses.  
   - **Actual:** Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator in the recursive rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate/Rule:** The recursive rule `coins_r/3` (lines 4–12) contains an undefined `->/2` operator.
- **Code Block with Error:**
  ```prolog
  coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
      CNT > 0,
      CNT1 is CNT - 1,
      (coin(CNT) -> 
          SC1 is SC + 1,
          coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1)
      ; 
          coins_r(SC, S, CNT1)
      ).
  ```
- **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is not recognized in the ProbLog context, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic is sound, but the use of `->/2` is not supported in ProbLog for conditional branching. ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic handling.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code attempts to use a deterministic conditional (`->/2`) instead of probabilistic implications (`P(A⇒B)`). This violates ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT` reaches 0.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but conditional branching is flawed).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (incorrect use of `->/2` instead of probabilistic implications).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined `->/2` operator in ProbLog.
  - Non-probabilistic handling of coin tosses.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator        | Code fails to execute           | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible probabilistic implications. |
| 2   | Non-probabilistic branching      | Incorrect probabilistic results | Use `probabilistic_if/2` or similar ProbLog constructs. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code fails due to the misuse of the `->/2` operator in a ProbLog context. To fix this, replace the conditional with ProbLog-compatible probabilistic constructs. The recursive logic is otherwise correct, and the edge cases are limited to the conditional branching issue. No DeepProbLog features are used.
