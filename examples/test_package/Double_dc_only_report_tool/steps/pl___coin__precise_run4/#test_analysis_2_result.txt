### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss experiment where a counter `CNT` decrements from 4 to 0. For each toss, if the coin lands heads (`coin(CNT)`), the success count `SC` increments by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(S)`  
- **Expected Behavior:** The query should compute the probability distribution of the total number of heads (`S`) after 4 coin tosses, where each toss has a 0.8 probability of landing heads.  
- **Actual Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  CallModeError: Invalid argument types for call to '>/2': arguments: (X1, 0), expected: (ground, ground) at 5:6.
  ```  
  The test fails due to a mode error in the `>` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(S)`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate:** `coins_r/3`  
  - **Line Interval:** 5-6 (the recursive clause with `CNT > 0`)  
- **Root Cause:**  
  The `>` predicate expects both arguments to be ground (instantiated) at the time of evaluation. However, `CNT` is not ground when the predicate is called, leading to the `CallModeError`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The recursive termination condition (`CNT > 0`) is logically correct, but the implementation violates ProbLog's mode restrictions.  
  - The error occurs because `CNT` is not instantiated before the `>` check.  

- **Probabilistic Scenario:**  
  - The code correctly models the probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`  
  - The negation (`\+ coin(CNT)`) adheres to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
  - No issues with probabilistic implications or conjunctions are observed.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but mode error prevents execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (probabilistic facts and negations are correctly defined).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle non-ground `CNT` values, which is a critical oversight.  
  - Performance for deep recursion is not tested but could be problematic for large `CNT`.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `>` predicate mode error         | Prevents execution              | Instantiate `CNT` before comparison |
| 2   | Non-ground `CNT` in recursion    | Logical correctness compromised | Ensure `CNT` is ground at runtime   |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code fails due to a mode error in the recursive predicate. Fixing the instantiation of `CNT` before the `>` check will resolve the issue. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented, but edge cases like non-ground variables must be addressed for robustness.
