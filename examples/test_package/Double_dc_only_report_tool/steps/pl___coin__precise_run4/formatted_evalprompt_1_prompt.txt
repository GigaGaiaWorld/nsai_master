 Here are the testing result of code:
 Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss scenario where a counter `CNT` decrements from 4 to 0. For each decrement, the code checks if the `CNT`th coin toss results in heads (with a probability of 0.8) and increments a success counter `SC` accordingly. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the logical and probabilistic correctness of the code and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Result:** The test failed with the error: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16`.

**Failed Queries:**
1. `query(total(_))`  
   - **Expected:** A probabilistic result for the total number of successful coin tosses.  
   - **Actual:** Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator in the recursive rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate/Rule:** The recursive rule `coins_r/3` (lines 4–12) contains an undefined `->/2` operator.
- **Code Block with Error:**
  ```prolog
  coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
      CNT > 0,
      CNT1 is CNT - 1,
      (coin(CNT) -> 
          SC1 is SC + 1,
          coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1)
      ; 
          coins_r(SC, S, CNT1)
      ).
  ```
- **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is not recognized in the ProbLog context, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic is sound, but the use of `->/2` is not supported in ProbLog for conditional branching. ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic handling.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code attempts to use a deterministic conditional (`->/2`) instead of probabilistic implications (`P(A⇒B)`). This violates ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning framework.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT` reaches 0.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but conditional branching is flawed).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (incorrect use of `->/2` instead of probabilistic implications).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined `->/2` operator in ProbLog.
  - Non-probabilistic handling of coin tosses.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator        | Code fails to execute           | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible probabilistic implications. |
| 2   | Non-probabilistic branching      | Incorrect probabilistic results | Use `probabilistic_if/2` or similar ProbLog constructs. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code fails due to the misuse of the `->/2` operator in a ProbLog context. To fix this, replace the conditional with ProbLog-compatible probabilistic constructs. The recursive logic is otherwise correct, and the edge cases are limited to the conditional branching issue. No DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
