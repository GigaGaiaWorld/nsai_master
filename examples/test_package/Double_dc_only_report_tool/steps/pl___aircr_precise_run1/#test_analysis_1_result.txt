### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. This report evaluates the correctness of the code, its probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` queries over 5 time steps:
- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - Time 1: 0.2625
  - Time 2: 0.1873
  - Time 3: 0.1269
  - Time 4: 0.0841
  - Time 5: 0.0570
- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - Time 1: 0.0000
  - Time 2: 0.0030
  - Time 3: 0.0110
  - Time 4: 0.0127
  - Time 5: 0.0114

**Verification**: All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time due to wind interference and actuator variability.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the probabilistic facts are properly defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures no unnecessary calculations once the goal is reached.
  - The direction and actuator contribution (`AE = sign(GP − Old) × AS`) is correctly computed.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
  - The probabilities of `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`).
  - The superposition of wind interference (`Pos = Old + AE + WE`) is correctly modeled.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The code correctly handles the movement logic and termination conditions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilistic facts and their combinations are correctly implemented.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception`) and ensures no movement beyond the legal range.
  - The recursive depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.
