### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system uses probabilistic rules to simulate the movement of flaps under wind interference and actuator strength variations. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. This report evaluates the correctness of the code, its probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to functional requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000          |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030          |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110          |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127          |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114          |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with expected behavior, given the probabilistic nature of actuator selection and wind effects.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:  
- `legal_flap_position/1`: Correctly defines the range of flap positions.  
- `actuator_strength/2`: Accurately models actuator strengths.  
- `use_actuator/2`: Probabilistically selects actuators.  
- `wind_effect/2`: Correctly models wind interference.  
- `attempted_flap_position/2`: Combines actuator thrust and wind effects to calculate new positions.  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `sign/1`, `between/3`) are correctly defined and used.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code correctly implements the logic for flap movement, actuator selection, and wind interference.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `attempted_flap_position/2` terminates as `Time` decreases to 0.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `use_actuator/2` and `wind_effect/2` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used in this code. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the flap movement logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities for actuator and wind effects are correctly computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code handles edge cases like `overrun_exception` when the flap position is out of bounds.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and adheres to the specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the test results confirm its correctness. No improvements are necessary for the current implementation.
