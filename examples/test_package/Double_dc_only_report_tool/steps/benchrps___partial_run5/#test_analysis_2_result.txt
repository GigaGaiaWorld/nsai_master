### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000, as `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a net score of -1 for `player1`.

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The code correctly implements the rules of rock-paper-scissors and computes the game results as expected. All predicates (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3`) are logically sound and terminate properly.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Analysis**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `beats/2` and `result/3` correctly model the game's win-lose relationships. Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate as expected.
  - **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as empty lists (`play([], [], [])`) and draws (`result(X, X, draw)`).

- **Probabilistic Analysis**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It operates purely in a deterministic context.
  - **DeepProbLog Features**: Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes results.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Non-list inputs or invalid gestures would cause errors.
  - **Performance**: The recursive predicates are efficient for small lists but may face performance issues with very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~350 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The implementation is correct and adheres to classical ProbLog rules. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic features (e.g., biased moves) or DeepProbLog integration for advanced use cases. Ensure input validation for robustness.
