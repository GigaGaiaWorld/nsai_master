### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic logic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000.
  - **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No Failures Detected:** All predicates and rules function as intended. The test case aligns with the expected outcome.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Problog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are correctly defined, ensuring accurate win-lose relationships.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates terminate correctly for both empty and non-empty lists.
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the game's logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes valid input lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the input list length, posing no performance issues for typical use cases.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Notes**
The implementation is robust and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified during testing. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features to extend functionality.
