### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, ensuring that the logical constraints are correctly encoded and that the solution adheres to the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification:**  
  The result satisfies all the given constraints. For example:  
  - The red house is owned by the English person.  
  - The Spanish person owns a dog.  
  - The green house is to the right of the ivory house.  
  - The Norwegian lives in the first house.  
  - The zebra is owned by the Japanese person.  
  - The water drinker is in the first house.  

  **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates and rules are correctly defined and satisfy the puzzle constraints.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The code correctly implements the logical constraints of the puzzle. Recursive predicates like `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` terminate correctly and cover all edge cases (e.g., houses at the boundaries).  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly encoded and solved.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The predicates `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` handle edge cases (e.g., first/last house) correctly.  
  - Input validation (e.g., ensuring `Houses` is a list of 5 houses) is implicit in the `houses/1` predicate.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is robust and correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle. No issues were identified during testing. The code adheres to the requirements and handles all edge cases effectively.
