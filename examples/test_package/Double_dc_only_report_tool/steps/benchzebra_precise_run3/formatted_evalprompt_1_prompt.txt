<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a `member/2` predicate definition. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at line 4, where the `member/2` predicate is first used.
- **Issue:** The `member/2` predicate is not defined in the code, despite being used extensively in the constraints.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented, but the absence of the `member/2` predicate prevents the code from executing.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` predicates are correctly defined and terminate properly.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents the code from functioning.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here, as the code does not use probabilistic facts.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** DeepProbLog features are not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes the input is a list of houses, but this is not explicitly validated.
  - The `member/2` predicate is a critical omission, as it is used in all constraints.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate | Code cannot execute | Define the `member/2` predicate or replace it with `my_member/2` (already defined in the code). |
| 2      | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add validation for the input list structure. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
To resolve the issue, replace all instances of `member/2` with `my_member/2` (which is already defined in the code). For example:
```prolog
my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),
my_member(house(_, spanish, dog, _, _), Houses),
...
```

Alternatively, define the `member/2` predicate explicitly:
```prolog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The code is logically sound but fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Once this issue is resolved, the code should execute correctly and solve the Zebra Puzzle as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the focus should remain on classical reasoning correctness. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
