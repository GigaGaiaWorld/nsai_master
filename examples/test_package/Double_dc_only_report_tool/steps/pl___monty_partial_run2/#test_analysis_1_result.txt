### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, and the host opens another door, revealing no prize. The contestant then decides whether to switch doors or stay with the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- All probabilities are correct.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- `open_door/1` correctly handles both scenarios:  
  - Randomly opening an unselected empty door (when both are empty).  
  - Opening the only unselected empty door (when one is empty and the other has a prize).  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` accurately reflect the winning conditions.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog:**  
- Logical correctness is ensured by proper use of `member/2` and negation (`\+`).  
- Recursive termination is guaranteed as `member/2` operates on finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
- Probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly defined as 1/3 for each door.  
- The negation `\+ prize(A)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
- The disjunction in `open_door/1` adheres to probabilistic rules.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature not used.** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) is present.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The logic correctly models the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. Probabilities are computed accurately.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the code.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable; `member/2` ensures list inputs.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the requirements. No errors or edge cases were overlooked.
