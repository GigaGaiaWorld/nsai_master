### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules. The evaluation also checks for edge cases and potential performance issues.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes with the expected output. The sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` is correctly generated with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The implementation correctly handles the provided test case. No discrepancies between actual and expected results were found.  
  - **Verified Predicates**:  
    - `swap/3`: Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on comparison.  
    - `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3`: Recursively sort the list and terminate as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**:  
    The predicates `hole/4`, `bubble/3`, and `bubblesort/3` are logically sound. The recursive termination condition (`bubblesort([],L,L)`) ensures the algorithm halts.  
  - **Probabilistic Rules**:  
    The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  

- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **Neural Network Integration**:  
    The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
    **Report**: DeepProbLog feature not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
  - **Empty List**: The code correctly handles empty lists (`bubblesort([],L,L)`).  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large N | Optimize with tail recursion.       |
| 3      | No probabilistic facts   | Limited to classical logic | Extend with probabilistic features. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical ProbLog logic. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Future improvements should address these limitations.
