### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al. (2013). The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes for reaching a goal position or encountering overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` queries over five time steps:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.2061`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1530`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.1077`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0716`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0682`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.1004`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.1104`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0865`

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions peaks around the middle steps.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, including:
- `legal_flap_position/1`
- `actuator_strength/2`
- `use_actuator/2`
- `wind_effect/2`
- `flap_position/2`
- `overrun_exception/1`
- `goal_reached/1`

The code block for `attempted_flap_position/2` (lines 20–30) correctly implements the functional requirement of calculating the current position based on the previous position, actuator strength, and wind effect.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures the system stops attempting new positions once the goal is reached.
- **Edge Cases**: The system handles illegal flap positions (`\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`) by triggering `overrun_exception`.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with the rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`: For example, `P(wind(strong)) = 0.3` implies `P(wind(weak)) = 0.7`.
  - `P(A ⇒ B) = P(¬A) + P(A ∧ B)`: Not directly used, but the probabilistic facts are correctly defined.

##### **DeepProbLog**  
- **Feature Not Used**: The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The system correctly models the flap movement and exceptions.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Fully met. The probabilities are correctly computed and propagated.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable.
- **Non-list Input**: Not applicable.
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

--- 

**Final Verdict**: The code is logically and probabilistically correct, with no failures detected. The system meets all specified requirements and handles edge cases appropriately.
