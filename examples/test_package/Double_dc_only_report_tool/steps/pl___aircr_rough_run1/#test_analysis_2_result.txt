### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al. (2013). The system simulates the movement of flaps using actuators, considering wind effects and legal flap positions. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical rules, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` for `T = 1..5`:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Verification**: All test results are consistent with the expected behavior of the system. No failures are detected.

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. The code correctly implements the logic for calculating flap positions, actuator usage, and wind effects.
- **Expansion Predicates**: Not applicable (no expansion predicates like `implies/2` or `opposite/1` are used).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The recursive termination condition (`Time > 0`) ensures the system does not run indefinitely.
  - The rules for `attempted_flap_position` correctly compute the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and the goal direction.

- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled in the probabilistic context.

- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code. No neural network integration is required.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The code correctly models the flap movement and goal achievement.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities for wind and actuator usage are correctly computed.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `legal_flap_position` is defined for integers 0–10).
  - **Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.
