<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. It simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, aiming to reach a target position. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the ProbLog implementation, analyzing test results, and identifying potential issues.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 33:208.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The error occurs during the evaluation of the `attempted_flap_position` predicate, specifically at line 33.  
- No probability results or successful queries are reported due to the failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `attempted_flap_position/2`  
- **Code Line:** 33  
- **Issue:** The error suggests a missing or malformed clause for the `->/2` operator, which is used in the conditional logic of the `attempted_flap_position` rule.  
- **Expected Behavior:** The rule should calculate the new flap position based on the actuator strength, wind effect, and target position.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The rule `attempted_flap_position` uses conditional logic (`Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1`), but the ProbLog engine fails to recognize the `->/2` operator.  
  - ProbLog does not natively support the `->/2` operator in this context.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined, but the error prevents their evaluation.  
  - The negation (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) is syntactically correct but not evaluated due to the failure.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the `->/2` operator issue prevents full evaluation.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly defined but not executed due to the error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `legal_flap_position` predicate ensures positions are within bounds, but the error prevents testing edge cases (e.g., overrun exceptions).  
  - Recursive termination is not verified due to the failure.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `->/2` operator not recognized   | Prevents evaluation of the rule | Replace `->/2` with `if-then-else`  |
| 2   | Missing clause for `->/2`        | Halts execution                | Rewrite the conditional logic       |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The code fails due to the unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog. Rewriting the conditional logic using `if-then-else` or equivalent ProbLog constructs is recommended. Once fixed, the probabilistic and classical reasoning aspects should function as intended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
