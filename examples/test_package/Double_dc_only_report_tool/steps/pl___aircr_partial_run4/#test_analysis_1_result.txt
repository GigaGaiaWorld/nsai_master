### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. It includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap positioning. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while avoiding overrun exceptions. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the code and its probabilistic reasoning.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` queries over 5 time steps:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - Time 1: 0.2625
  - Time 2: 0.1873
  - Time 3: 0.1269
  - Time 4: 0.0841
  - Time 5: 0.0570

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - Time 1: 0.0000
  - Time 2: 0.0030
  - Time 3: 0.0110
  - Time 4: 0.0127
  - Time 5: 0.0114

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but increase slightly.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The rules for `flap_position`, `overrun_exception`, and `goal_reached` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition.
  - The probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) comply with ProbLog's rules, such as `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.

- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` are correctly defined and combined.
  - The computation of `attempted_flap_position` accounts for actuator strength and wind effects, ensuring probabilistic consistency.

- **DeepProbLog**:
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code. Reported as "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The code correctly models the flap controller's behavior.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities are computed accurately.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles edge cases like `legal_flap_position` bounds (0–10) and ensures no undefined behavior.
  - No issues with recursive performance or non-list inputs were observed.
