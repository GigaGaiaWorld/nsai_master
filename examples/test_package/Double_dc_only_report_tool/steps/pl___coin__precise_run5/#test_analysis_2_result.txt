### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, counting the number of successful outcomes (heads) over a fixed number of trials. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(S)`  
  - **Expected Behavior:** The query should return the probability distribution of the total number of successful coin tosses (`S`) after 4 trials.  
  - **Actual Result:**  
    ```plaintext
    Error evaluating Problog model:
    UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
    ```  
  - **Conclusion:** The test failed due to a syntax error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(S)`  
  - **Error Location:** Line 8, Column 16  
  - **Problematic Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    (coin(CNT) -> SC1 is SC + 1 ; SC1 = SC)
    ```  
  - **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is incorrectly used, leading to an `UnknownClause` error. The syntax for conditional logic in ProbLog is not properly implemented.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic in `coins_r/3` is intended to count successful coin tosses, but the conditional statement is malformed.  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` is correctly defined, but the recursive case fails due to the syntax error.  

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8)` correctly assigns a probability of 0.8 to each coin toss.  
  - However, the error prevents the probabilistic computation from being executed.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but syntax error prevents execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not executed due to the error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle edge cases such as invalid inputs (e.g., negative `CNT`).  
  - Performance for deep recursion is not tested due to the early failure.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Syntax error in `->/2` operator  | Prevents execution of the query  | Replace `->/2` with proper ProbLog conditional syntax (e.g., `if/3`). |
| 2      | No edge case handling            | Potential runtime errors         | Add input validation for `CNT`.     |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**  
1. **Fix Syntax Error:**  
   Replace the malformed conditional with ProbLog-compatible syntax, such as:  
   ```prolog
   if(coin(CNT), SC1 is SC + 1, SC1 = SC).
   ```  

2. **Add Edge Case Handling:**  
   Ensure `CNT` is non-negative in the recursive case.  

3. **Test Probabilistic Output:**  
   After fixing the syntax, verify the probability distribution of `total(S)` matches expectations (e.g., binomial distribution with `n=4`, `p=0.8`).
