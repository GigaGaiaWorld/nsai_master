           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, counting the number of successful outcomes (heads) over a fixed number of trials. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(S)`  
  - **Expected Behavior:** The query should return the probability distribution of the total number of successful coin tosses (`S`) after 4 trials.  
  - **Actual Result:**  
    ```plaintext
    Error evaluating Problog model:
    UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
    ```  
  - **Conclusion:** The test failed due to a syntax error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(S)`  
  - **Error Location:** Line 8, Column 16  
  - **Problematic Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    (coin(CNT) -> SC1 is SC + 1 ; SC1 = SC)
    ```  
  - **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is incorrectly used, leading to an `UnknownClause` error. The syntax for conditional logic in ProbLog is not properly implemented.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic in `coins_r/3` is intended to count successful coin tosses, but the conditional statement is malformed.  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` is correctly defined, but the recursive case fails due to the syntax error.  

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - The probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8)` correctly assigns a probability of 0.8 to each coin toss.  
  - However, the error prevents the probabilistic computation from being executed.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but syntax error prevents execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not executed due to the error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle edge cases such as invalid inputs (e.g., negative `CNT`).  
  - Performance for deep recursion is not tested due to the early failure.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Syntax error in `->/2` operator  | Prevents execution of the query  | Replace `->/2` with proper ProbLog conditional syntax (e.g., `if/3`). |
| 2      | No edge case handling            | Potential runtime errors         | Add input validation for `CNT`.     |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**  
1. **Fix Syntax Error:**  
   Replace the malformed conditional with ProbLog-compatible syntax, such as:  
   ```prolog
   if(coin(CNT), SC1 is SC + 1, SC1 = SC).
   ```  

2. **Add Edge Case Handling:**  
   Ensure `CNT` is non-negative in the recursive case.  

3. **Test Probabilistic Output:**  
   After fixing the syntax, verify the probability distribution of `total(S)` matches expectations (e.g., binomial distribution with `n=4`, `p=0.8`).

**Word Count:** 450 words

This report highlights the critical issues in the provided ProbLog code and provides actionable recommendations for improvement. Let me know if you'd like further details or assistance with the fixes!

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
