  "HASH": "06576BEB",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core functionality. The code correctly implements the number predicate and multi_addition as required. However, edge cases (non-list inputs, undefined image IDs, deep recursion) are not handled.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for lists in the number predicate. 2. Add error handling for undefined image IDs. 3. Consider an iterative implementation to avoid deep recursion risks.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
