### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog Context**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12.
  ```
- **Conclusion**: The test did not pass due to a syntax error in the Prolog code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Error Location**: Line 4, Column 12.
- **Problematic Code**:
  ```prolog
  (X > Y ->
      bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted)
  ;
      bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted)
  ).
  ```
- **Issue**: The `->` operator is not correctly interpreted in ProbLog, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `->` operator is valid in standard Prolog for conditional branching, but ProbLog does not support it directly.
  - The recursive termination is logically correct, but the syntax is incompatible with ProbLog.

- **ProbLog Context**:
  - ProbLog requires explicit handling of probabilistic facts and implications. The `->` operator is not part of ProbLog's syntax.
  - No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used, so DeepProbLog features are not utilized.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but syntactically incompatible).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for large lists.
  - The `expand/2` predicate is undefined, which might be required for ProbLog compatibility.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `->` operator not supported      | ProbLog execution fails         | Replace with ProbLog-compatible conditionals (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Probabilistic reasoning missing | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed. |
| 3   | Non-list input not handled       | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.                       |
| 4   | Deep recursion for large lists   | Performance issues              | Optimize or limit recursion depth.          |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**
The code fails due to syntax incompatibility with ProbLog. To fix this:
1. Replace the `->` operator with a ProbLog-compatible alternative.
2. Add input validation and edge-case handling.
3. Consider adding probabilistic features if required.

**Word Count**: ~450 words.
