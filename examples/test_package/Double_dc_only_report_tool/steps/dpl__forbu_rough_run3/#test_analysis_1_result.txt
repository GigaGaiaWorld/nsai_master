### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Algorithm in ProbLog Context**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
  problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:14.
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: The test failed due to an unsupported operator (`->/2`) in ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `bubblesort/3`  
  - **Line Interval**: 4:14 (the `->` operator in the conditional statement).  
- **Actual vs. Expected**:  
  - **Actual**: ProbLog does not support the `->/2` operator.  
  - **Expected**: The code should use ProbLog-compatible constructs (e.g., `if/3` or explicit clauses).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate is logically correct for Prolog but uses the `->/2` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured for valid inputs.  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - The error arises because ProbLog does not recognize the `->/2` operator.  
  - No probabilistic facts or implications are used, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is irrelevant here.  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails in ProbLog due to unsupported operator).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic constructs used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs or empty lists are handled correctly.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator | ProbLog execution fails         | Replace `->/2` with `if/3` or split into separate clauses. |
| 2   | No probabilistic constructs | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic facts if needed.  |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**  
The code is logically sound for Prolog but requires modification to work in ProbLog. The primary issue is the unsupported `->/2` operator. Addressing this will resolve the error and make the code ProbLog-compatible. No edge cases or performance issues were identified beyond this.
