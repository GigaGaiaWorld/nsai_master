bubblesort([X], Acc, [X|Acc]).
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-

 Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog Context**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12.
  ```
- **Conclusion**: The test did not pass due to a syntax error in the Prolog code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Error Location**: Line 4, Column 12.
- **Problematic Code**:
  ```prolog
  (X > Y ->
      bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted)
  ;
      bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted)
  ).
  ```
- **Issue**: The `->` operator is not correctly interpreted in ProbLog, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `->` operator is valid in standard Prolog for conditional branching, but ProbLog does not support it directly.
  - The recursive termination is logically correct, but the syntax is incompatible with ProbLog.

- **ProbLog Context**:
  - ProbLog requires explicit handling of probabilistic facts and implications. The `->` operator is not part of ProbLog's syntax.
  - No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used, so DeepProbLog features are not utilized.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but syntactically incompatible).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for large lists.
  - The `expand/2` predicate is undefined, which might be required for ProbLog compatibility.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `->` operator not supported      | ProbLog execution fails         | Replace with ProbLog-compatible conditionals (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Probabilistic reasoning missing | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed. |
| 3   | Non-list input not handled       | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.                       |
| 4   | Deep recursion for large lists   | Performance issues              | Optimize or limit recursion depth.          |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**
The code fails due to syntax incompatibility with ProbLog. To fix this:
1. Replace the `->` operator with a ProbLog-compatible alternative.
2. Add input validation and edge-case handling.
3. Consider adding probabilistic features if required.

**Word Count**: ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
