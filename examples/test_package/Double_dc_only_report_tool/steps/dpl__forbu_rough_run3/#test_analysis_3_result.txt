### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation with ProbLog Compatibility**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, identify failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:
  ```
  Error evaluating ProbLog model: No clauses found for 'if_then_else/3' at 4:5.
  ```
- **Conclusion**: The test failed due to an undefined predicate `if_then_else/3`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`.
- **Error Location**: 
  - **Predicate**: `if_then_else/3`.
  - **Code Block**: Line 4 in the `bubblesort/3` rule.
- **Actual vs. Expected**:
  - **Actual**: Error due to missing `if_then_else/3` definition.
  - **Expected**: Successful sorting of the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `bubblesort/3` algorithm is logically correct but relies on `if_then_else/3`, which is not a built-in Prolog predicate. This causes the failure.
  - **Recursive Termination**: The recursion is well-defined and terminates correctly for valid inputs.
  
- **ProbLog Context**:
  - The error indicates that ProbLog does not recognize `if_then_else/3`. ProbLog requires explicit definitions for such predicates or the use of built-in constructs.
  - **Probabilistic Rules**: Not applicable here as the issue is purely syntactic.

- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logically correct but missing predicate).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to the undefined predicate.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Predicate**: `if_then_else/3` is not defined.
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `if_then_else/3` | Prevents execution of the sort. | Replace with Prolog's `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` or define the predicate. |
| 2   | Non-list input handling  | May cause runtime errors.       | Add input validation.               |
| 3   | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow.       | Optimize for tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. Replace `if_then_else/3` with Prolog's built-in conditional construct:
   ```prolog
   bubblesort([X, Y | Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
       (X > Y -> 
           bubblesort([X | Rest], [Y | Acc], Sorted)
       ; 
           bubblesort([Y | Rest], [X | Acc], Sorted)
       ).
   ```
2. Add input validation for non-list inputs.
3. Test with edge cases (e.g., empty list, single-element list, large lists).
