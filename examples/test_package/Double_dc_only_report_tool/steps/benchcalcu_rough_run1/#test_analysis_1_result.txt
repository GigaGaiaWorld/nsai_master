### Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The solution ensures that:
- All digits are unique.
- The first digit of any multi-digit number is not zero.
- The arithmetic constraints are satisfied with carry propagation.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
1. Verify the correctness of the code.
2. Analyze the test results.
3. Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Problog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided are as follows:
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each query returns a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the constraints are correctly enforced and the solutions are valid.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** All queries satisfy the constraints:
  - `leftdigit/1` ensures non-zero leading digits.
  - `all_different/1` ensures uniqueness of digits.
  - `sumdigit/5` correctly models the arithmetic with carry propagation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Problog:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The predicates (`leftdigit`, `all_different`, `sumdigit`) are logically sound.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates as the list shrinks with each call.
  
- **Probabilistic Problog:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.
  - **Non-list Input:** The input is hardcoded as a list, so no issues arise.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to the number of digits (5), so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code is well-structured and correctly implements the cryptoaddition puzzle. All test cases pass, and the logic adheres to classical Problog rules. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the analysis is limited to classical reasoning. The solution is robust and handles edge cases effectively.
