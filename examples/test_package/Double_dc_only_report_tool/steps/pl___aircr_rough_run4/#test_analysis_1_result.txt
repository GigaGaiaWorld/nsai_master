### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al. (2013). The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. This report evaluates the correctness of the code, its probabilistic reasoning, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.2311             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1370             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0771             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0455             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000          |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030          |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0115          |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0124          |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0106          |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but possible.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `attempted_flap_position` and `flap_position` correctly handle the movement logic, including wind effects and actuator strength.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as expected, with `Time > 0` ensuring no infinite loops.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the flap movement and goal achievement.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly implemented.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `legal_flap_position` ensures valid flap positions).  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | No errors detected | N/A    | N/A        |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. No issues were identified during testing. Future work could explore integrating DeepProbLog for more complex scenarios.
