### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing Predicates**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a ProbLog program with extended logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the code and its test results.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic reasoning.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog and DeepProbLog requirements.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob))) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (returned `0.0000`).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The following predicates are missing or incorrectly implemented:  
1. **`implies/2`**: Defined but not tested correctly.  
2. **`opposite/1`**: Not defined in the code.  
3. **`expand/2`**: Defined but not tested correctly.  
4. **`includes/2`**: Not defined in the code.  
5. **`extend/3`**: Not defined in the code.  
6. **`refute/1`**: Not defined in the code.  

**Code Line Numbers:**  
- Missing predicates: Entirely absent.  
- `implies/2`: Line with hash tag `3F5BA02C`.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `implies/2` predicate is defined but not tested properly.  
  - Missing predicates (`opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) cause failures.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The `member/2` and `prove/1` predicates are correctly implemented and terminate.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The code does not handle probabilistic facts or negations (`P(¬A)=1−P(A)`).  
  - The `implies/2` predicate does not comply with `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Neural Network Calls:**  
  - No `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls are present.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (only `member/2` and `prove/1` are correct).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (missing probabilistic handling).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Undefined `expand/2` for non-numeric inputs.  
- Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` are not handled.  
- Deep recursion performance is untested.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `opposite/1`             | Fails `opposite` queries        | Implement `opposite/1`.             |
| 2   | Missing `includes/2`             | Fails `includes` queries        | Implement `includes/2`.             |
| 3   | Missing `extend/3`               | Fails `extend` queries          | Implement `extend/3`.               |
| 4   | Missing `refute/1`               | Fails `refute` queries          | Implement `refute/1`.               |
| 5   | Incorrect `implies/2` test       | Incorrect results               | Correct the test logic.             |
| 6   | No probabilistic handling       | Fails probabilistic reasoning   | Add probabilistic facts/rules.      |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revisions to meet the functional requirements and handle edge cases. Focus on implementing missing predicates and testing probabilistic scenarios.
