  "ErrorSummary": "Missing predicates (opposite/1, includes/2, extend/3, refute/1), potential infinite recursion in prove/1, and timeout during execution.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Implement all missing predicates as per requirements. 2. Add recursion depth limits to prove/1 (e.g., prove(Goal, Depth) with base case for Depth=0). 3. Optimize clause/2 lookup for performance.",
