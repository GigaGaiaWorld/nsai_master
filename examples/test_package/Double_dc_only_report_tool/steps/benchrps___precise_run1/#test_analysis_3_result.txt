### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the logic, test the functionality, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules. The focus is on the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which calculates the winner based on two lists of moves.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 44:16.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `determine_winner/3`  
- **Error Location**: Line 44, where the predicate is defined.  
- **Issue**: The predicate definition is incomplete or malformed. The error suggests a missing or incorrect clause for the `->/2` operator.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Analysis**:  
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate is intended to:  
    1. Call `play/3` to compare moves and generate results.  
    2. Use `compute_score/2` to tally the score.  
    3. Determine the winner based on the score.  
  - The error arises because the predicate definition is syntactically incorrect. The `->/2` operator is not properly used or defined.  

- **Probabilistic Analysis**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code. The logic is purely deterministic.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic for move comparison (`result/3`) and recursive play (`play/3`) is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate is flawed.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or mismatched move lists are not handled.  
  - The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Malformed `determine_winner/3`   | Predicate fails to execute      | Correct the predicate definition.   |
| 2   | Missing edge case handling       | Unpredictable behavior          | Add input validation.               |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**  
Here is the corrected `determine_winner/3` predicate:  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The code's core logic is sound, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate requires correction. Once fixed, the implementation will meet the functional requirements for classical reasoning. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases should be addressed for robustness.
