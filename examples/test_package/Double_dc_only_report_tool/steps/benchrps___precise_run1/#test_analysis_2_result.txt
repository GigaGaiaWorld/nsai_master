### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a basic rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, with predicates to determine the winner based on lists of moves from two players. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze test results and identify failures.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location:** The error points to line 41, where the `determine_winner` predicate is defined. The issue arises from incorrect syntax or missing clauses.
- **Code Block with Error:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
  - **Issue:** The predicate name `determine_winner` is misspelled (`P2Moves` vs. `P2Moves`).
  - **Line Numbers:** 41-77 (approximate).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog:**
  - The logical structure of the `result/3` and `play/3` predicates is correct.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score.
  - The error is purely syntactic (misspelled variable name).
- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.
  - The code is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog:**
  - No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met (except for the syntax error).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `determine_winner(rock, paper, W)`).
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the simplicity of the game.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Misspelled variable `P2Moves` in `determine_winner` | Predicate fails to execute | Correct the spelling to `P2Moves` |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The implementation is logically sound but contains a critical syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate. Once corrected, the code should function as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the evaluation focuses on classical Prolog correctness.
