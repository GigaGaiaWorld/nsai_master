### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and calculating the overall score. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze any failures in the test results.
- Ensure compliance with classical ProbLog reasoning and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating "No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77."

**Failed Queries**:
1. `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`.
   - **Expected**: The winner should be determined based on the results of each round.
   - **Actual**: Error due to missing or incorrect predicate definition.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate**: The error points to an issue with the `determine_winner/3` predicate.
- **Code Line**: The error occurs around line 41, where the predicate is defined.
- **Root Cause**: The predicate `determine_winner/3` is not correctly implemented or lacks proper clauses.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate is also correctly implemented for `win`, `lose`, and `draw` cases.
- **Recursive Termination**:
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor`). Thus, the evaluation focuses on classical ProbLog reasoning.
- **Error Specifics**:
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate is incomplete or incorrectly formatted, leading to the error.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The basic game logic (`result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`) is correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this code.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (reported as "DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is acceptable for this use case.
  - **Undefined Predicates**: The `determine_winner/3` predicate is undefined or incorrectly implemented.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing/incorrect `determine_winner/3` | Test failure | Correct the predicate definition and ensure it calls `play/3` and `compute_score/2` properly. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors      | Add input validation for lists.    |
| 3   | DeepProbLog features not used    | N/A                           | Not applicable for this code.      |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The code correctly implements the core logic of rock-paper-scissors but fails due to an incomplete `determine_winner/3` predicate. Addressing this issue and adding input validation will resolve the test failures. The code does not use probabilistic or DeepProbLog features, focusing solely on classical reasoning.
