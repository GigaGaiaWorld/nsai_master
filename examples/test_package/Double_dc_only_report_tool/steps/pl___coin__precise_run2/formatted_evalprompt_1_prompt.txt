    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss scenario where a counter (`CNT`) decrements from a given value (e.g., 4) to 0. For each decrement, the code checks if the coin lands heads (`coin(CNT)`) and increments a success counter (`SC`). The final result (`S`) accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and identify any logical or probabilistic errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Expected:** A probabilistic result for the total number of successful coin tosses.  
  - **Actual:** Error due to an undefined clause for `->/2` (implication operator).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 7, Column 12: The implication operator `->` is not correctly defined or used.  
  - **Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    (coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC),
    ```
  - **Issue:** The syntax for conditional logic in ProbLog is incorrect. The `->/2` operator is not natively supported in this context.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive termination condition (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined.  
  - The issue lies in the conditional logic for updating `NSC`. ProbLog requires explicit handling of probabilistic conditions, not imperative-style conditionals.

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The code does not comply with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules. The `coin(C)` predicate is defined with a probability (`0.8`), but the conditional logic (`->`) is not valid in ProbLog for probabilistic queries.

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not Used:** The code does not involve neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but conditional logic is flawed).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (incorrect handling of probabilistic conditions).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` or similar predicates are not present.  
  - Non-list input or deep recursion is not an issue here.  
  - The primary edge case is the misuse of conditional logic in a probabilistic context.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `->/2` operator        | Prevents execution of the query | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2      | Incorrect probabilistic handling | Results in invalid probabilities | Use `probabilistic_facts` and `query` correctly. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code fails due to the misuse of imperative-style conditionals in a ProbLog context. To fix this, replace the `->` operator with ProbLog-compatible probabilistic constructs. The recursive logic is otherwise sound, but the probabilistic reasoning must adhere to ProbLog's rules. No DeepProbLog features are used.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
