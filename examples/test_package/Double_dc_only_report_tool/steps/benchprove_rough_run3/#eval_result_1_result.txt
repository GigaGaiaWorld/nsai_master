  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. Minor edge cases exist (undefined expand/2 terms, non-list inputs), but these are not critical failures.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Optional improvements: (1) Add a fallback rule for undefined expand/2 terms (e.g., `expand(Term, _) :- \+ clause(expand(Term, _), _), fail`). (2) Add input validation for includes/2 and extend/3 (e.g., `includes(List, Elem) :- is_list(List), member(Elem, List)`).",
