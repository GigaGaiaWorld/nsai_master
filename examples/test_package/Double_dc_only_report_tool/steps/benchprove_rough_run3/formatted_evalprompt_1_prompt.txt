prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 1.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code with Extended Logic Processing Predicates**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a ProbLog program with extended logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the test results.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the predicates.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules.  
- Identify edge cases and potential improvements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and all returned the expected results with a probability of `1.0000`:  
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))`  
2. `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))`  
3. `prove(expand(double(3),6))`  
4. `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))`  
5. `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates function as intended:  
- **`implies/2`**: Correctly proves `Goal2` if `Goal1` is true.  
- **`opposite/1`**: Correctly negates the goal using `\+ prove(Goal)`.  
- **`expand/2`**: Uses predefined rules (e.g., `double/2`, `square/2`) to expand terms.  
- **`includes/2`**: Correctly checks list membership using `member/2`.  
- **`extend/3`**: Adds an element to the head of the list.  
- **`refute/1`**: Equivalent to `opposite/1`, correctly negates the goal.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - Recursive predicates (e.g., `member/2`, `ancestor/2`) terminate correctly.  
  - The meta-interpreter (`prove/1`) handles compound goals (`A,B`) and negation (`\+`) correctly.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2` terms would fail, which is expected.  
  - Non-list inputs to `includes/2` or `extend/3` would raise errors, but this is not tested here.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is satisfied by `opposite/1` and `refute/1`.  
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)` is satisfied by `implies/2`.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The meta-interpreter and extended predicates work as intended.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Fully met. The predicates comply with probabilistic rules.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

##### **Edge Cases and Improvements**  
- **Undefined `expand/2` Terms**: The code does not handle cases where `expand/2` is called with undefined terms. A fallback rule could be added.  
- **Non-List Inputs**: Input validation for `includes/2` and `extend/3` could be improved.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion (e.g., long lists for `member/2`) may impact performance, but this is not critical for small datasets.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Undefined `expand/2` terms | Query fails | Add a fallback rule for undefined terms. |
| 2      | Non-list inputs to `includes/2` or `extend/3` | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 3      | Deep recursion for long lists | Performance hit | Optimize or limit recursion depth. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Verdict:** The code is logically and probabilistically sound, with minor edge cases that could be addressed for robustness. All tests pass, and the requirements are fully met.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
