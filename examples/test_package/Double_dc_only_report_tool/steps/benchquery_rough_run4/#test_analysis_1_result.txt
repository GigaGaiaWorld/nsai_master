### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Density Query Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities (within a 5% margin). The code includes a `density/2` predicate to calculate density and a requirement to define a `query_pop/1` predicate for the query. The test results indicate an error due to the absence of the `query_pop/1` clause.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Test Result**: Failure  
  - **Error**: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7`  
  - **Impact**: The query cannot be executed because the required predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query_pop(_)`  
  - **Location**: Line 59  
  - **Issue**: The predicate `query_pop/1` is called but not defined in the code.  
  - **Expected Behavior**: The predicate should be defined to query pairs of countries with approximately equal densities.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `density/2` predicate is correctly defined to calculate population density.  
  - The missing `query_pop/1` predicate is the root cause of the error.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code. The analysis is purely classical.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The `density/2` predicate works, but the `query_pop/1` predicate is missing.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `query_pop/1` predicate.  
  - Non-list input handling is not addressed.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `query_pop/1` predicate | Query cannot be executed       | Define `query_pop/1` to implement the query logic. |

---

### **Suggested Fix**  
To resolve the error, define the `query_pop/1` predicate as follows:  

```prolog
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05.
```

This predicate will:  
1. Calculate the density for two distinct countries.  
2. Ensure their densities differ by no more than 5%.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The code is logically sound for calculating densities but fails due to the missing `query_pop/1` predicate. Implementing the suggested fix will enable the query to function as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this example.
