### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification:** The output matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, confirming that all constraints are satisfied.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly defined for list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly defined using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly implements the right adjacency relationship.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The constraints in the `zebra/1` predicate are logically sound and correctly encode the puzzle's clues.  
  - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly for finite lists.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined variables would cause errors, but the code assumes valid input.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the fixed length of the list (5 houses).  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved deterministically.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid input (a list of 5 houses). Invalid inputs would lead to failures.  
- **Performance:** The fixed list size ensures no performance issues, but scalability to larger puzzles would require testing.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and adheres to classical logic programming principles. No failures were detected, and the solution aligns with the expected output. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic constraints or integrating DeepProbLog features for more complex scenarios.
