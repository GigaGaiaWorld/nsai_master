### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, verify test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic logic rules. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, recursive termination, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
  ```
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:**  
  The test passes with a probability of 1.0000, indicating the correct sorted output.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
- The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively calls itself on `L2` and appends the current maximum value `X` to the sorted part `[X|L3]`.  
- The `swap/3` predicate correctly determines whether to swap elements based on their values.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `hole/4` predicate ensures elements are swapped or retained based on the `swap/3` predicate.  
  - The `bubble/3` predicate correctly identifies the maximum element in each pass.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate terminates when the input list is empty, ensuring recursive termination.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Empty List:** Handled by the base case `bubblesort([],L,L)`.  
  - **Single-Element List:** Handled by `bubble([X],[],X)`.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`).  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement               | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning       | Satisfied   | The bubble sort logic is correctly implemented and terminates recursively.  |
| Probabilistic Reasoning   | Not Used    | No probabilistic facts or rules are employed.                               |
| Neural Network Integration| Not Used    | No DeepProbLog features are utilized.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Non-List Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow (not tested here).  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are present.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error | Add input validation for lists.            |
| 2   | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow risk   | Optimize for tail recursion or iterative.  |

### **Final Remarks**  
The ProbLog implementation of bubble sort is functionally correct for the tested case. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
