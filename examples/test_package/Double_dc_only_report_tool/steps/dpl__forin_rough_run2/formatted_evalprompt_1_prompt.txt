</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Insertion Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze its behavior in classical and probabilistic contexts (if applicable).
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:**  
  The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.

**All tests passed (no failures).**  
The absence of failures indicates that the implementation correctly sorts the input list using the insertion sort algorithm.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.**  
  The code behaves as expected for the provided test case. All predicates (`insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3`) are correctly defined and executed without errors.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Context**
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are logically sound. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])` and the recursive case correctly builds the sorted list by inserting each element in the right position.
  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Empty List:** Handled by the base case.
  - **Single-Element List:** Implicitly handled by the recursive logic.
  - **Non-List Input:** Not explicitly checked, but Prolog's type system will raise an error if non-list input is provided.

##### **ProbLog Context**
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.
  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  **DeepProbLog feature not used.** The code does not involve neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) or probabilistic implications.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  Fully met. The code correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm.
  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**
- **Non-List Input:**  
  The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs, which could lead to runtime errors.
  
- **Deep Recursion:**  
  For very large lists, the recursive implementation may lead to stack overflow. Tail recursion optimization could mitigate this.

- **Performance:**  
  Insertion sort has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), making it inefficient for large datasets.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion risk | Stack overflow for large lists | Optimize with tail recursion or iterative approach. |
| 3      | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic sorting | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The provided Prolog code for insertion sort is correct and meets the classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized. Addressing the identified edge cases would enhance the code's reliability.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
