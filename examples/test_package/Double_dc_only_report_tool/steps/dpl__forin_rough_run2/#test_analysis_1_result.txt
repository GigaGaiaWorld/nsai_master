### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Insertion Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze its behavior in classical and probabilistic contexts (if applicable).
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:**  
  The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.

**All tests passed (no failures).**  
The absence of failures indicates that the implementation correctly sorts the input list using the insertion sort algorithm.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.**  
  The code behaves as expected for the provided test case. All predicates (`insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3`) are correctly defined and executed without errors.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Context**
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are logically sound. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])` and the recursive case correctly builds the sorted list by inserting each element in the right position.
  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Empty List:** Handled by the base case.
  - **Single-Element List:** Implicitly handled by the recursive logic.
  - **Non-List Input:** Not explicitly checked, but Prolog's type system will raise an error if non-list input is provided.

##### **ProbLog Context**
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.
  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  **DeepProbLog feature not used.** The code does not involve neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) or probabilistic implications.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  Fully met. The code correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm.
  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**
- **Non-List Input:**  
  The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs, which could lead to runtime errors.
  
- **Deep Recursion:**  
  For very large lists, the recursive implementation may lead to stack overflow. Tail recursion optimization could mitigate this.

- **Performance:**  
  Insertion sort has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), making it inefficient for large datasets.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion risk | Stack overflow for large lists | Optimize with tail recursion or iterative approach. |
| 3      | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic sorting | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The provided Prolog code for insertion sort is correct and meets the classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized. Addressing the identified edge cases would enhance the code's reliability.
