### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```problog
  query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```problog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed with the correct sorted output and a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are correctly implemented and satisfy the requirements:  
  1. Recursively sort the tail list.  
  2. Insert the head element into the sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.  
  - The recursive case correctly splits the list into head and tail, sorts the tail, and inserts the head into the sorted tail.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion terminates because the tail list decreases in size with each recursive call.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used**.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements insertion sort.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion may lead to stack overflow for very large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Consider iterative approaches for large datasets. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The insertion sort implementation is correct for classical ProbLog scenarios and passes all provided tests. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with deep recursion. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
