### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, aiming to reach a target position while avoiding overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for the first five time steps:
- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`
- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Verification**: All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low but non-zero.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are properly defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code correctly implements the requirements:
  1. **Goal Check**: The predicate `goal_reached` verifies if the current position matches the goal.
  2. **Actuator Selection**: The `use_actuator` predicate selects an actuator probabilistically, and its strength is retrieved via `actuator_strength`.
  3. **Actuator Contribution**: The direction and thrust (`AE`) are calculated as `sign(GP − Old) × AS`.
  4. **Wind Interference**: The wind effect (`WE`) is superimposed on the actuator's contribution to compute the new position (`Pos`).

- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The code adheres to probabilistic rules:
  - The negation of `legal_flap_position` is handled correctly (`\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`).
  - The probabilities of `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` are correctly computed and combined.

- **DeepProbLog**: No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The logic for flap movement and goal verification is sound.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Fully met. The probabilistic facts and their combinations are correctly implemented.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not used in this code.
  - **Non-list Input**: Not applicable.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), so performance is not an issue.
