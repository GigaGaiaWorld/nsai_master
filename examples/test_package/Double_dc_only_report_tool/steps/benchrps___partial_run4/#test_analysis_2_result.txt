### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game logic.
- Ensure the probabilistic and classical reasoning components are correctly implemented.
- Identify any edge cases or potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:** The test passed successfully. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000.

**All tests passed (no failures).** The code correctly implements the game logic and computes the winner based on the provided moves.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** All predicates and rules are correctly defined and executed as expected.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `move/1`: Correctly defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
  - `beats/2`: Correctly defines the win-lose relationships.
  - `result/3`: Correctly computes the outcome of each round (`win`, `lose`, `draw`).
  - `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Correctly handle recursion and score computation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `result/3` and `beats/2` are logically sound and cover all possible game outcomes.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.
- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
- **DeepProbLog:**
  - **Feature Not Used:** The code does not integrate neural networks or tensor operations.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists of valid gestures. Non-list inputs or invalid gestures would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**
The provided ProbLog code for rock-paper-scissors is well-implemented and passes all tests. It adheres to classical logic programming principles and handles the game's requirements effectively. No issues were identified during the evaluation. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic rules or neural network integration for advanced scenarios.
