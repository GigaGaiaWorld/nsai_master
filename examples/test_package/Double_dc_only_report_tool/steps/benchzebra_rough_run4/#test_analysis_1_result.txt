### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result:** 
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, confirming that all constraints are satisfied.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly adheres to the puzzle's constraints and produces the expected output.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3` are correctly defined and recursively terminate. The constraints in the `zebra/1` predicate are logically sound and cover all puzzle clues.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The result probability of `1.0000` indicates deterministic reasoning, which is appropriate for this puzzle. No probabilistic facts or negations are used, so no further probabilistic checks are required.
- **DeepProbLog:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here, as the puzzle is deterministic.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All required predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are defined.
  - **Non-list Input:** The `houses/1` predicate ensures the input is a list of five houses.
  - **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (five houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and meets all specified requirements. The code is logically sound, and the test results confirm its accuracy. No failures or edge cases were identified. The absence of probabilistic or DeepProbLog features is noted but does not affect the correctness of the solution.
