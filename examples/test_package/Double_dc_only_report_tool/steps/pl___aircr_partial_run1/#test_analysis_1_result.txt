### Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. It includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap positioning. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while avoiding overrun exceptions. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` queries over five time steps:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Verification**: All tests pass (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior:
- The probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, reflecting the probabilistic nature of actuator and wind effects.
- Overrun exceptions occur only when the flap position exceeds legal bounds, which is rare and increases slightly with time.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules are correctly defined:
- **`flap_position/2`**: Correctly updates the flap position if legal (lines 1–5).
- **`overrun_exception/1`**: Triggers when the flap position is illegal (lines 6–8).
- **`goal_reached/1`**: Checks if the flap reaches the goal (lines 9–11).
- **`attempted_flap_position/2`**: Computes the new position based on actuator and wind effects (lines 12–20).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The code terminates correctly as it operates within a bounded time frame (`at(5)`).
  - Recursive dependencies (e.g., `flap_position/2` calling `attempted_flap_position/2`) are well-defined and terminate.

- **Probabilistic Rules**:
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with ProbLog's rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - The computation of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` probabilities reflects the joint distribution of actuator and wind effects.

- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code. No neural network integration is present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The code correctly handles deterministic rules (e.g., `legal_flap_position`).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities for actuator and wind effects are correctly modeled.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception`) but assumes bounded time steps (`at(5)`). Unbounded recursion could lead to performance issues.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
