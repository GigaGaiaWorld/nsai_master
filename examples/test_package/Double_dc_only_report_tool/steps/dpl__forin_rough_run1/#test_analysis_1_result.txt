### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Insertion Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, recursive termination, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The code correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm, and the test query returned the expected result.  
  - **Predicates Verified**:  
    - `insertion_sort/2` (lines 1–3)  
    - `insert/3` (lines 4–8)  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The algorithm recursively sorts the tail of the list and inserts the head into the correct position in the sorted tail. The base case (`insertion_sort([], [])`) ensures termination.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion terminates when the input list is empty, as specified by the base case.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules**:  
  The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  **Not Used**: The code does not involve neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) or probabilistic implications.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-List Input**:  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**:  
  The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n²), which is typical for insertion sort but may be inefficient for large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used     | Limited to classical reasoning  | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The insertion sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and does not utilize ProbLog or DeepProbLog features. Future improvements could include input validation and integration with probabilistic reasoning if required.
