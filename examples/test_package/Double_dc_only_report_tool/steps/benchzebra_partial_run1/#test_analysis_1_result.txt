### Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test result provided is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification**: The output satisfies all the given constraints (e.g., the owner of the red house is English, the Spanish has a dog, etc.).
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**: All predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the test result aligns with the expected solution.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical ProbLog Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The code correctly models the puzzle constraints using predicates like `my_member`, `right_of`, and `next_to`. Recursive definitions (e.g., `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) ensure termination by reducing the problem size in each recursive call.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as:
  - Ensuring the middle house drinks milk (`Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _, _]`).
  - Validating adjacency constraints (e.g., Norwegian next to the blue house).

##### **Probabilistic Analysis**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) is used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly deduces the solution to the puzzle.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases and Robustness**
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates detected.
- **Input Validation**: The code assumes valid input (a list of 5 houses). Non-list inputs or lists of incorrect length would cause errors.
- **Performance**: Recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) are efficient for small lists but may face performance issues with larger datasets.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is logically sound and correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle. No failures or probabilistic features were detected. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation and exploring probabilistic extensions if needed.
