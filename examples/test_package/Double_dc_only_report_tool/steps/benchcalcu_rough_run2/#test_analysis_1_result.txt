### Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The goal is to ensure the code correctly enforces constraints (e.g., unique digits, no leading zeros) and produces valid solutions.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results show the following solutions with a probability of `1.0000`:
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9])`
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0])`
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8])`
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1])`
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2])`
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6])`
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8])`
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5])`
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7])`
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9])`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly enforces the constraints and produces valid solutions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** All queries returned valid solutions with a probability of `1.0000`, confirming the correctness of the constraints and predicates.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates (`leftdigit`, `all_different`, `sumdigit`) are logically sound. The recursive `all_different` terminates correctly for lists of digits.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input is a list of digits; no handling for invalid inputs.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to the number of digits (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |
