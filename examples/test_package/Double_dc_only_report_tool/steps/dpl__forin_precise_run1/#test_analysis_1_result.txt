### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze the test results.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic logic rules.
- Identify edge cases and potential improvements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```problog
  query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```problog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:** The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.

**All tests passed (no failures).** The implementation correctly sorts the input list and adheres to the specified requirements.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The code correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm:
  1. Recursively sorts the tail of the list (`insertion_sort(T, SortedTail)`).
  2. Inserts the head element (`H`) into the sorted tail (`insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted)`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], []).`).
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as the list is progressively reduced in size until it becomes empty.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this example.
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not use any neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`). **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this example (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly (`insertion_sort([], []).`).
- **Performance:** The recursive nature of the algorithm may lead to performance issues for very large lists (deep recursion).

##### **Suggestions for Improvement**
1. Add input validation to handle non-list inputs.
2. Consider iterative implementations for large lists to avoid deep recursion.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime errors | Add input validation |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Performance issues | Implement iterative version |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code is functionally correct for the given test case but could be improved for robustness and performance.
