### Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to requirements. The code simulates the scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door, and the contestant decides whether to switch or stay.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query            | Probability Result |
|------------------|--------------------|
| `prize(1)`       | 0.3333             |
| `prize(2)`       | 0.3333             |
| `prize(3)`       | 0.3333             |
| `select_door(1)` | 1.0000             |
| `win_keep`       | 0.3333             |
| `win_switch`     | 0.6667             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities for the Monty Hall problem:
- `win_keep` (staying with the initial choice) has a 1/3 chance of winning.
- `win_switch` (switching doors) has a 2/3 chance of winning.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- **`open_door/1` Rules:** Correctly handle both scenarios (randomly opening an empty door or opening the only empty door).
- **`win_keep` and `win_switch`:** Accurately reflect the winning conditions for staying or switching.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` and winning conditions are logically sound.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate terminates correctly for finite lists.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` is correctly defined.
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+ prize(A)` and `\+ prize(B)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The rules correctly simulate the Monty Hall scenario.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., doors 1, 2, or 3). Non-list inputs or invalid door numbers are not handled.
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem is correct and meets all specified requirements. No failures or edge-case issues were identified. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation for robustness.
