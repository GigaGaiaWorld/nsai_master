bubblesort([X], Acc, [X|Acc]).
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    (X > Y,
     bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted))
    ;
    (X =< Y,
     bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted)).

 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[12, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided Prolog code implements a bubble sort algorithm (`bubblesort/3`) and a wrapper predicate (`forth_sort/2`) to sort a list. The goal of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`.
- **Result**: `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [12, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1]) = 1.0000`.
- **Verification**: The test result matches the expected output (sorted list in descending order).  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No Failures Detected**: The implementation correctly sorts the input list as per the test case.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Empty List**: The predicate `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` handles this case correctly.  
  - **Single-Element List**: The predicate `bubblesort([X], Acc, [X|Acc])` handles this case correctly.  
  - **Non-List Input**: The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs, which could lead to runtime errors.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively compares and swaps adjacent elements, ensuring the largest element "bubbles" to the end of the list.  
  - The recursion terminates correctly when the list is empty or contains a single element.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`), so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The implementation meets the requirement for classical Prolog reasoning.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-List Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs, which could be problematic.  
  - **Performance**: The bubble sort algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may not be efficient for large lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Performance for large lists | Inefficient sorting            | Consider using a more efficient algorithm (e.g., quicksort). |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The Prolog implementation of the bubble sort algorithm is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs and may not be efficient for large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this code.  

**Word Count**: ~350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
