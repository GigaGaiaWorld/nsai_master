### Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Prolog Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog Context**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, intended to be interpretable in ProbLog. The goal is to verify its correctness, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`
- **Result**: The test failed with the error: `No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12.`
- **Impact**: The program cannot execute due to a syntax or semantic error in the conditional statement.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`
- **Error Location**: Line 4, Column 12 in the `bubblesort/3` predicate.
- **Problem**: The conditional operator `->` is not recognized or improperly used in the ProbLog context.
- **Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
      (X > Y ->
          bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted)
      ;
          bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted)
      ).
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:
  - The `->` operator is valid in standard Prolog for conditionals, but ProbLog may not support it directly.
  - The recursive logic is correct for bubblesort, but the conditional syntax is incompatible with ProbLog's engine.
  
- **ProbLog Context**:
  - ProbLog requires explicit handling of probabilistic facts and rules. The conditional `->` is not a valid ProbLog construct.
  - The error suggests that ProbLog cannot resolve the `->` operator, leading to a failure in clause evaluation.

- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (logical structure is correct, but syntax is incompatible).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (conditional operator is unsupported).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Non-list Input**: Not handled (e.g., `forth_sort(3, X)` would fail).
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance impact not evaluated.
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates, but the `->` operator is problematic.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog | Program fails to execute | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible conditionals (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No handling for non-list input   | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. Replace the `->` operator with a ProbLog-compatible conditional construct.
2. Add input validation to handle non-list inputs gracefully.
3. Test the corrected implementation with edge cases (e.g., empty lists, single-element lists).
