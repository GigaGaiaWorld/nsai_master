/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and maintains the same functionality as the original code. It restructures the recursive clause 'coins_r' by inlining the operations for updating the score and counter, but the logic remains unchanged. Both codes calculate the probabilities of getting different counts of successful coin flips out of 4 attempts, with each flip having an 80% chance of success. The generated code is more concise but equally valid.
