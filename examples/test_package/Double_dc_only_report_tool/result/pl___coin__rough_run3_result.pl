/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause by using 'coin(C)' without properly grounding the variable C. This leads to an error during execution. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic choice by using 'coin(CNT)' which grounds the variable. The generated code also changes the logic by introducing a 'head' check which wasn't present in the original code.
