0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a significant difference in the 'bb' predicate. The original code uses 'Max is N-1' and checks 'between(1,Max,I)', while the generated code directly uses 'between(1, N, I), I < N'. This change alters the behavior slightly but does not affect the validity of the code. The main issue is that the running results differ (0.3750 vs 0.6484), indicating a logical inconsistency in the generated code's implementation of the 'bb' predicate.
