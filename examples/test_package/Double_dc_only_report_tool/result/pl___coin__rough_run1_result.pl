/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. The main issue is that it incorrectly uses 'c1' as a constant in the 'coin(c1)' call and then tries to use it as a predicate in the next line, which leads to a runtime error ('UnknownClause'). The original code correctly uses a variable 'CNT' to represent the coin and checks its probability. The generated code fails to maintain the logical structure and variable usage of the original code.
