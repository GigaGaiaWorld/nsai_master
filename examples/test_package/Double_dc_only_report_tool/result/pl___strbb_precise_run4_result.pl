0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-
 
 Max is N - 1, between(1, Max, I), pick(I, b), J is I + 1, pick(J, b).
len(5).
evidence(palindrome(X)) :- len(X).
query(bb(X)) :- len(X).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The only minor difference is the variable name change from 'II' to 'J' in the 'bb' predicate, which does not affect the behavior of the code. The running results of both pieces of code are identical, producing the same probability for bb(5).
