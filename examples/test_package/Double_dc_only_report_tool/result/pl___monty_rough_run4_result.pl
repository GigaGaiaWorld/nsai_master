/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining consistency with the original code's functionality. It simplifies the door-opening rules while preserving the probabilistic outcomes. Both codes produce identical results for prize distribution, door selection, and winning probabilities (keep vs switch). The generated code is valid and meets requirements.
