0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-
 
 Max is N - 1, between(1, Max, I), pick(I, b), pick(I + 1, b).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there is a subtle difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'pick(I + 1, b)' instead of the original 'II is I+1, pick(II,b)'. This change does not affect the logical correctness but could potentially impact the execution flow. The running results differ significantly (0.3750 vs 0.6484), indicating that the modification in the 'bb' predicate has a substantial effect on the probability calculation. This suggests that the generated code, while syntactically valid, does not produce the same probabilistic outcomes as the original.
