0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-
 
 N > 1, M is N - 1, between(1, M, I), pick(I, b), pick(I + 1, b). bb(0) :- fail. bb(1) :- fail.

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code modifies the original 'bb' predicate by adding conditions for N=0 and N=1, which were not present in the original. This change affects the probability calculation, leading to a different result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is syntactically correct but semantically inconsistent with the original, as it alters the logic and resulting probabilities.
