/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog, and they produce the same sorted list for the given input. The generated code uses an accumulator pattern, which is a common optimization in Prolog, making it slightly more efficient than the original code. The logic for inserting elements into the sorted list is identical in both codes, ensuring the same results.
