/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the Monty Hall problem logic but introduces syntax errors and structural changes that make it invalid. Specifically, the 'open_door' rule contains incorrect syntax ('->/2' is not properly handled) and lacks proper probabilistic declarations. This causes the code to fail during execution. The original code correctly implements the problem with clear probabilistic rules and works as expected.
