/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there are notable differences in the implementation of the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, which affects the probabilities in the results. The generated code uses a different approach to calculate the new position, leading to higher probabilities for both 'goal_reached' and 'overrun_exception' compared to the original code. This suggests that while the generated code is valid and meets the basic requirements, it does not perfectly replicate the original behavior.
