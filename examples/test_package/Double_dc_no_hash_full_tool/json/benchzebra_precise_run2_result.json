  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it uses 'member/2' instead of 'my_member/2', which causes an error since 'member/2' is not defined. Second, the order of attributes in some house predicates is incorrect (e.g., 'house(english, red, _, _, _)' should be 'house(red, english, _, _, _)'). These inconsistencies make the generated code invalid and prevent it from producing the same result as the original code."
