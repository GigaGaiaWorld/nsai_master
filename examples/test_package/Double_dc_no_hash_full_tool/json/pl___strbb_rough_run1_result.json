  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a subtle difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'pick(I + 1, b)' instead of calculating 'II' as in the original. This change does not affect the validity of the code but leads to a different probability result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, but the results are not consistent with the original due to this modification."
