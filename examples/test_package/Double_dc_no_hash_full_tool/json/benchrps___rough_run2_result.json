  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. It simplifies the result calculation by combining the three result conditions into a single predicate 'play_round', which improves readability without changing the logic. Both codes correctly implement the rock-paper-scissors game rules and determine the winner based on the computed score. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
