  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. The main issue is the incorrect use of the '->' operator in the 'coins_r' predicate, which is not valid Problog syntax. The original code uses a probabilistic choice between 'coin(CNT)' and 'not coin(CNT)', while the generated code incorrectly tries to use a conditional operator. This leads to a syntax error during execution. The generated code also loses the probabilistic nature of the original problem by hardcoding 'c1' instead of using the variable 'CNT'."
