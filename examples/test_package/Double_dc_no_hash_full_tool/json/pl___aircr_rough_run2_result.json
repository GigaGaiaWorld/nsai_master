  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. The main difference lies in the reformulation of the 'attempted_flap_position' predicate, which has been rewritten for clarity but maintains the same operational semantics. The generated code produces identical results to the original, indicating no functional discrepancies. Both codes are valid and meet the requirements."
