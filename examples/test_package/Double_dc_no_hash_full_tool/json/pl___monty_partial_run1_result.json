  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes model the Monty Hall problem accurately, with the same probability distributions for the prize, door selection, and outcomes of keeping or switching doors. The generated code simplifies some conditions by using 'A \\= B' instead of 'A < B', which does not affect the logic but makes the code slightly more concise. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
