### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot navigates between locations, picks up a key, and carries it. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like `goto`, `pickup`, and `drop`, as well as deterministic rules for tracking the positions of the robot and the key. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.4331`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` = `0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, given the probabilistic rules and deterministic constraints.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules are correctly defined and behave as expected.  

- **Predicate `at/3` for the robot:**  
  - The three rules for `at/3` correctly handle the robot's movement based on the success or failure of `goto` actions and the absence of such actions.  
- **Predicate `at/3` for the key:**  
  - The two rules for `at/3` correctly model the key's position based on whether the robot is carrying it or not.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The rules for `carrying/2`, `drops/2`, and `slippery/2` are logically sound and terminate correctly. Recursive definitions (e.g., `slippery(key,s(T))`) include base cases (`slippery(key,0)`).  
- **Negation as Failure:**  
  - The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is correctly applied in predicates like `carrying/2` and `drops/2`.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `fumbles_key/1` comply with the rule `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`. For example, `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.3::pickup_fails(T)` correctly sums to 1.  
- **Implications:**  
  - The implications in the rules (e.g., `drops(key,T) :- slippery(key,T), drop_slippery_key(T)`) are correctly modeled.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:**  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  - Fully met. The deterministic rules for `at/3` and `carrying/2` correctly model the robot's and key's behavior.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  - Fully met. The probabilistic facts and their implications are correctly defined and computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  - Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:**  
  - No undefined predicates or edge cases were detected.  
- **Performance:**  
  - The recursive definitions (e.g., `slippery(key,s(T))`) are well-bounded and unlikely to cause performance issues.
