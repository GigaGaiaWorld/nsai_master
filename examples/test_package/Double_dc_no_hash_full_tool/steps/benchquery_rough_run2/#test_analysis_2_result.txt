#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Population Density Query in Prolog: Verification and Validation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code defines a predicate `query_pop/1` to query pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within a 5% margin). The code uses facts for population (`pop/2`) and area (`area/2`) to calculate density and compare pairs of countries. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with logical and probabilistic rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 2.440828402366864, france, 2.464788732394366]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 2.23859649122807, pakistan, 2.192926045016077]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 2.192926045016077, indonesia, 2.23859649122807]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 0.760471204188482, ethiopia, 0.777142857142857]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 4.775862068965517, philippines, 4.611111111111111]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 2.464788732394366, china, 2.440828402366864]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 4.611111111111111, italy, 4.775862068965517]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 0.777142857142857, mexico, 0.760471204188482]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the predicate `query_pop/1` correctly identifies pairs of countries with population densities differing by no more than 5%.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicate `query_pop/1` and its helper predicate `density/2` are correctly implemented.  

- **Predicate `density/2`:**  
  - Line: `density(Country, Density) :- pop(Country, Pop), area(Country, Area), Density is Pop / Area.`  
  - Correctly calculates the population density for a given country.  

- **Predicate `query_pop/1`:**  
  - Line: `query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :- ...`  
  - Ensures the countries are distinct (`Country1 \= Country2`) and the density difference is within 5% (`abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05`).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The predicates are logically sound. The `density/2` predicate correctly computes the density, and `query_pop/1` enforces the 5% margin constraint.  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here, as the predicates are non-recursive.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)`).  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the logic to compare population densities.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid country names and numeric values for `pop/2` and `area/2`. Undefined inputs (e.g., non-existent countries) would fail silently or raise errors.  
  - **Non-list Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list of four elements. Non-list inputs would cause a type error.
