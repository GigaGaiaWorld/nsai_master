### Evaluation Report: Query Population and Area Database

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Population Density Query in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The predicate `query_pop/4` is intended to achieve this by comparing the densities of two distinct countries. However, the test results indicate an error due to the absence of the `density/2` predicate, which is required to calculate the population density.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Test Query**: `query(query_pop(_))`  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
  problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'density/2' at 10:56.
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: The test fails because the `density/2` predicate is not defined, which is essential for calculating population density.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `density/2`  
- **Error Location**: The error occurs when the `query_pop/4` predicate attempts to call `density/2`, which is undefined.  
- **Code Line**: The error is traced to the line where `density(Country1, Density1)` is called within the `query_pop/4` rule.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The logic of `query_pop/4` is sound, assuming `density/2` is correctly defined. It ensures that two distinct countries are compared and their densities are within 5% of each other.  
  - The absence of `density/2` prevents the query from executing.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this code.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - No recursion is involved in the provided code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The `query_pop/4` predicate is correctly defined, but the supporting `density/2` predicate is missing.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle cases where the population or area data is missing or invalid.  
  - The `density/2` predicate must be defined to avoid runtime errors.

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `density/2` predicate | Query execution fails            | Define `density/2` to calculate population density from `pop/2` and `area/2`. |

---

#### **Suggested Fix**  
Add the following predicate to calculate population density:  
```prolog
density(Country, Density) :- pop(Country, Pop), area(Country, Area), Density is Pop / Area.
```

This will enable the `query_pop/4` predicate to function as intended.
