### **Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Prolog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Population Density Query in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided Prolog code is designed to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density. The density is calculated as `(population * 100) // area`, and the query identifies pairs where the density of one country is slightly higher than the other but within a 5% margin (as per the conditions `D1 > D2`, `T1 is 20*D1`, `T2 is 21*D2`, and `T1 < T2`).

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic correctness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided are as follows:
1. `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`
2. `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`
3. `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`
4. `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`

**Verification:**
- All test results are consistent with the expected output. The pairs of countries listed satisfy the density conditions specified in the `query_pop` predicate.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules (`density/2`, `pop/2`, `area/2`, and `query_pop/1`) are correctly defined and executed as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density using integer division (`//`).
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the densities of the two countries are within a 5% margin, as required.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`). It is purely deterministic.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population density.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`, `query_pop/1`) are defined.
  - **Non-list Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list of four elements (`[C1,D1,C2,D2]`). No edge cases for invalid input were tested.
  - **Performance:** The code does not involve recursion or complex computations, so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**
The code is well-structured and meets its functional requirements for classical reasoning. No issues were identified during testing. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features if the problem scope expands to include uncertainty or neural network integration.
