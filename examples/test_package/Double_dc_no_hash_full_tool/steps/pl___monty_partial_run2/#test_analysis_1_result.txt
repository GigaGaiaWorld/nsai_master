### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior, winning conditions).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic (as expected).
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules adhere to the problem's requirements:
- **`open_door/1` Rules:**
  - Correctly handles cases where both unselected doors are empty (random selection).
  - Correctly handles cases where one unselected door has a prize (selects the empty door).
- **`win_keep` and `win_switch`:**
  - Accurately reflect the winning conditions for the "keep" and "switch" strategies.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` and winning conditions are logically sound.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate terminates correctly for finite lists.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` is correctly defined.
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+` (negation) in `open_door/1` and `win_switch` complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.

**DeepProbLog:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., deterministic selection of doors).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., correct probability distributions).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list inputs, but the code ensures valid lists are used.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to small input size (3 doors).

**Code Blocks:**
```prolog
% Probabilistic facts
1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).

% Host behavior
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]), member(B, [1,2,3]), A \= B,
    \+ select_door(A), \+ select_door(B), \+ prize(A), \+ prize(B).

open_door(A) :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), \+ prize(A),
    member(B, [1,2,3]), B \= A, \+ select_door(B), prize(B).

% Winning conditions
win_keep :- select_door(D), prize(D).
win_switch :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), prize(A), \+ open_door(A).
```
