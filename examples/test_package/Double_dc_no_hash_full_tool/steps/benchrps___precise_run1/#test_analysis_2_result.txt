### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game, including move definitions, win-lose relationships, and a scoring system to determine the winner. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with classical ProbLog reasoning.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or predicate definition issue in the `determine_winner` rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed due to an undefined predicate or syntax error in the `determine_winner` rule.  
- **Error Location**:  
  The error points to line 41, column 77, where the `->` operator is incorrectly used or missing a clause.  
- **Code Block with Issue**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
  The issue lies in the conditional logic (`->` and `;` operators).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  The `determine_winner` predicate is intended to compute the winner based on the results of `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. However, the conditional logic (`->`) is not correctly implemented, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are logically correct, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails to handle the conditional branching properly.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`). Thus, no probabilistic rules need verification.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic (`play/3`, `compute_score/2`) works, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion performance is acceptable due to list-based termination.  
  - The `determine_winner` predicate does not account for invalid moves (e.g., non-rock/paper/scissor inputs).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` | Prevents winner determination   | Correct the conditional logic in `determine_winner`. |
| 2   | No handling of invalid moves     | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation for `move/1`.          |
| 3   | Non-list inputs not handled      | May cause recursion errors      | Add checks for list inputs in predicates.   |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fixes**  
1. **Correct `determine_winner`**:  
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
       compute_score(Results, Score), 
       (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
        Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
        Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
   ```
2. **Add Input Validation**:  
   ```prolog
   valid_moves([]).
   valid_moves([H|T]) :- move(H), valid_moves(T).
   ```
3. **Handle Non-list Inputs**:  
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
       is_list(P1Moves), is_list(P2Moves),
       valid_moves(P1Moves), valid_moves(P2Moves),
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
       compute_score(Results, Score), 
       (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
        Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
        Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
   ```

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The core logic is sound, but the `determine_winner` predicate requires correction to handle conditional logic and edge cases.
