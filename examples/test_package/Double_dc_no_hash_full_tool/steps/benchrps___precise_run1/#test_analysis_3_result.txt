### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game, including move definitions, win-lose relationships, and a predicate to determine the winner based on a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the logic, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or predicate definition issue in the `determine_winner` rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
- **Error Location**:  
  The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically at the line where the `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are called. The issue is likely due to incorrect predicate usage or missing clauses.  
- **Code Block with Error**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The `determine_winner` predicate is intended to compute the winner by comparing moves and scoring the results. However, the error suggests that the predicate is not correctly defined or called.  
  - The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is logically correct, but the error arises from the predicate call structure.  

- **Probabilistic Scenario**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`). Thus, the analysis focuses on classical logic.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic for move comparison and scoring is correct, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails due to a syntax or definition issue.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs for `P1Moves` or `P2Moves` are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size, but performance could degrade with very long lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `determine_winner` predicate error | Prevents winner determination   | Fix predicate definition and syntax |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation                |
| 3   | No probabilistic features        | Limits functionality            | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fixes**  
1. **Correct the `determine_winner` Predicate**:  
   Ensure the predicate is correctly defined and called. For example:  
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
       compute_score(Results, Score), 
       (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
   ```
   Verify that `play/3` and `compute_score/2` are correctly implemented.

2. **Add Input Validation**:  
   Include checks to ensure `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists of valid moves (rock, paper, scissor).

3. **Extend with Probabilistic Rules (Optional)**:  
   If probabilistic reasoning is desired, add probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., weighted moves).
