</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game, including move definitions, win-lose relationships, and a scoring system to determine the winner. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with classical ProbLog reasoning.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or predicate definition issue in the `determine_winner` rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed due to an undefined predicate or syntax error in the `determine_winner` rule.  
- **Error Location**:  
  The error points to line 41, column 77, where the `->` operator is incorrectly used or missing a clause.  
- **Code Block with Issue**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
  The issue lies in the conditional logic (`->` and `;` operators).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  The `determine_winner` predicate is intended to compute the winner based on the results of `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. However, the conditional logic (`->`) is not correctly implemented, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are logically correct, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails to handle the conditional branching properly.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`). Thus, no probabilistic rules need verification.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic (`play/3`, `compute_score/2`) works, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion performance is acceptable due to list-based termination.  
  - The `determine_winner` predicate does not account for invalid moves (e.g., non-rock/paper/scissor inputs).  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` | Prevents winner determination   | Correct the conditional logic in `determine_winner`. |
| 2   | No handling of invalid moves     | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation for `move/1`.          |
| 3   | Non-list inputs not handled      | May cause recursion errors      | Add checks for list inputs in predicates.   |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fixes**  
1. **Correct `determine_winner`**:  
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
       compute_score(Results, Score), 
       (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
        Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
        Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
   ```
2. **Add Input Validation**:  
   ```prolog
   valid_moves([]).
   valid_moves([H|T]) :- move(H), valid_moves(T).
   ```
3. **Handle Non-list Inputs**:  
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
       is_list(P1Moves), is_list(P2Moves),
       valid_moves(P1Moves), valid_moves(P2Moves),
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
       compute_score(Results, Score), 
       (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
        Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
        Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
   ```

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The core logic is sound, but the `determine_winner` predicate requires correction to handle conditional logic and edge cases.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
