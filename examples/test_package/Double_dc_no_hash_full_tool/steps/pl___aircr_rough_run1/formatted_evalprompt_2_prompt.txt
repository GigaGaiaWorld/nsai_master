<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Model**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog model simulates an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The model includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap positioning. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while accounting for actuator strength and wind interference. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the model, identify failures, and analyze root causes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error at line 33:177. The error suggests that the ProbLog engine could not find a definition for a predicate or operator (e.g., `->/2`). No query results are provided due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs during the evaluation of the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.
- **Error Location**: Line 33, where the `->/2` operator is used in the rule:
  ```prolog
  (G > PrevPos -> Dir is Strength ; Dir is -Strength)
  ```
- **Root Cause**: The `->/2` operator is not recognized or improperly defined in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for calculating the flap position (`attempted_flap_position`) is sound but relies on Prolog's `->/2` operator, which may not be fully supported in ProbLog.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The model correctly defines probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) and adheres to probabilistic rules (`P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used. The model is purely probabilistic.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The model's logic is correct, but the `->/2` operator causes a failure.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Fully met. Probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The `->/2` operator is not supported in ProbLog, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` for `->/2` | Model evaluation fails         | Replace `->/2` with `if-then-else` logic. |
| 2   | No query results           | Unable to verify correctness  | Fix the `->/2` issue and re-run tests.    |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the problematic line with an equivalent `if-then-else` construct supported by ProbLog:
```prolog
Dir is (G > PrevPos ? Strength : -Strength)
```

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The model's probabilistic reasoning is correct, but the use of unsupported Prolog operators (`->/2`) must be addressed to ensure successful execution.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
