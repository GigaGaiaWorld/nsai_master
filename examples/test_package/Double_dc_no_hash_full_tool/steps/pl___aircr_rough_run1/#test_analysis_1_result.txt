### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Model**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, aiming to reach a goal position. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the model, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and logical rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Queries Executed**:
  - `goal_reached(T)` for `T` between 1 and 5.
  - `overrun_exception(T)` for `T` between 1 and 5.
- **Results**:
  - **Failure**: The test failed with an `ArithmeticError` due to an unknown function `';'/2` in the evaluation of `is(4,6+4>6->2; -2+-1)`.
  - **No Successful Queries**: The error prevented any queries from completing successfully.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs during the evaluation of the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.
- **Error Location**:
  - **Code Block**: 
    ```prolog
    attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
      Time > 0, 
      Prev is Time-1, 
      flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), 
      \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
      use_actuator(Time, Actuator), 
      actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength), 
      goal(G), 
      wind_effect(Time, WindEffect), 
      Pos is PrevPos + (G > PrevPos -> Strength ; -Strength) + WindEffect.
    ```
  - **Line Number**: The error is traced to the arithmetic expression `Pos is PrevPos + (G > PrevPos -> Strength ; -Strength) + WindEffect`.
- **Issue**: The use of `;` in the arithmetic expression is invalid in ProbLog. The correct syntax should use `if-then-else` logic without `;`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The predicate `attempted_flap_position` is intended to calculate the new flap position based on the actuator strength, wind effect, and goal direction. However, the use of `;` in the arithmetic expression is syntactically incorrect in ProbLog.
- **Probabilistic Rules**:
  - The probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`) and their implications are correctly defined, but the arithmetic error prevents their evaluation.
- **Recursive Termination**:
  - The recursion in `flap_position` and `attempted_flap_position` is logically sound, but the arithmetic error halts execution prematurely.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met, but the arithmetic error prevents full evaluation.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly modeled but not executed due to the error.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The arithmetic expression is a critical edge case. The use of `;` in arithmetic is not supported in ProbLog, leading to the error.
  - The model does not handle cases where `wind_effect` or `actuator_strength` might produce invalid positions (e.g., negative values).

#### **7. Error Summary**

| **No.** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Invalid use of `;` in arithmetic     | Halts execution of all queries      | Replace `(G > PrevPos -> Strength ; -Strength)` with `if-then-else` logic.     |
| 2       | No handling of invalid positions     | Potential runtime errors            | Add checks to ensure `Pos` remains within legal bounds (0â€“10).                 |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the problematic arithmetic expression in `attempted_flap_position` with:
```prolog
Pos is PrevPos + ( (G > PrevPos) -> Strength ; -Strength ) + WindEffect.
```
Alternatively, use a helper predicate to compute the direction:
```prolog
direction(G, PrevPos, Strength, Dir) :- (G > PrevPos -> Dir = Strength ; Dir = -Strength).
attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
  Time > 0,
  Prev is Time-1,
  flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
  \+ goal_reached(Prev),
  use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
  actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
  goal(G),
  wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
  direction(G, PrevPos, Strength, Dir),
  Pos is PrevPos + Dir + WindEffect,
  legal_flap_position(Pos).
```

#### **9. Conclusion**
The model's logical and probabilistic foundations are sound, but the arithmetic error must be resolved to enable successful execution. Addressing the syntax issue and edge cases will ensure robust performance.
