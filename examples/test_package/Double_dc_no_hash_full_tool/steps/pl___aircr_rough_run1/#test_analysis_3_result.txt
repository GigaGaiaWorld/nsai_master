### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, aiming to reach a goal position. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code.
- Analyze test results and identify failures.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a **ParseError** during evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1349, in label_tokens
    parser.label_tokens(self.string, self.tokens)
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1186, in label_tokens
    raise ParseError(string, "Expected binary operator", t.location)
problog.parser.ParseError: Expected binary operator at 33:184.
```
- **Impact**: The error prevents the model from executing any queries.
- **Queries**: None were executed due to the error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location**: The error occurs at line 33, character 184, in the ProbLog parser.
- **Root Cause**: The parser expects a binary operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`) but encounters an invalid or missing operator in the code.
- **Affected Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time - 1,
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
    goal(G),
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
    Dir is (G > PrevPos ? Strength : -Strength),
    Pos is PrevPos + Dir + WindEffect.
  ```
  - **Issue**: The ternary operator `?` is not a valid binary operator in ProbLog. ProbLog does not support ternary operators; instead, it requires explicit conditional logic (e.g., `if-then-else` or separate clauses).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for calculating the flap position is sound, but the syntax is invalid due to the unsupported ternary operator.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined, but the error prevents their evaluation.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used in this model.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (invalid syntax prevents execution).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not evaluated due to the error.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The ternary operator is a critical oversight. ProbLog requires explicit conditional logic.
  - Recursive termination is not verified due to the error.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Invalid ternary operator `?`     | Prevents code execution         | Replace with explicit `if-then-else` logic |
| 2   | ParseError in ProbLog parser     | No queries executed             | Fix syntax and retest                      |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Syntax Fix**: Replace the ternary operator with explicit conditional logic:
   ```prolog
   (G > PrevPos -> Dir is Strength ; Dir is -Strength),
   ```
2. **Retest**: After fixing the syntax, rerun the queries to verify probabilistic and classical reasoning.
