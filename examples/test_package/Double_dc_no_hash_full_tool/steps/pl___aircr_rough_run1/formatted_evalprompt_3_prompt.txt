<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, aiming to reach a goal position. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code.
- Analyze test results and identify failures.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a **ParseError** during evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1349, in label_tokens
    parser.label_tokens(self.string, self.tokens)
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1186, in label_tokens
    raise ParseError(string, "Expected binary operator", t.location)
problog.parser.ParseError: Expected binary operator at 33:184.
```
- **Impact**: The error prevents the model from executing any queries.
- **Queries**: None were executed due to the error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location**: The error occurs at line 33, character 184, in the ProbLog parser.
- **Root Cause**: The parser expects a binary operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`) but encounters an invalid or missing operator in the code.
- **Affected Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time, Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time - 1,
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
    goal(G),
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
    Dir is (G > PrevPos ? Strength : -Strength),
    Pos is PrevPos + Dir + WindEffect.
  ```
  - **Issue**: The ternary operator `?` is not a valid binary operator in ProbLog. ProbLog does not support ternary operators; instead, it requires explicit conditional logic (e.g., `if-then-else` or separate clauses).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for calculating the flap position is sound, but the syntax is invalid due to the unsupported ternary operator.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) are correctly defined, but the error prevents their evaluation.
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used in this model.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (invalid syntax prevents execution).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not evaluated due to the error.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The ternary operator is a critical oversight. ProbLog requires explicit conditional logic.
  - Recursive termination is not verified due to the error.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Invalid ternary operator `?`     | Prevents code execution         | Replace with explicit `if-then-else` logic |
| 2   | ParseError in ProbLog parser     | No queries executed             | Fix syntax and retest                      |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Syntax Fix**: Replace the ternary operator with explicit conditional logic:
   ```prolog
   (G > PrevPos -> Dir is Strength ; Dir is -Strength),
   ```
2. **Retest**: After fixing the syntax, rerun the queries to verify probabilistic and classical reasoning.

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Format**: Markdown with tables and code blocks.

This report highlights the critical syntax error and provides actionable steps to resolve it. Let me know if you'd like further assistance with the corrected code or additional analysis.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
