### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Model**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog model simulates an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The model includes probabilistic rules for actuator selection, wind effects, and flap positioning. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 while accounting for actuator strength and wind interference. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the model, identify failures, and analyze root causes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error at line 33:177. The error suggests that the ProbLog engine could not find a definition for a predicate or operator (e.g., `->/2`). No query results are provided due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs during the evaluation of the `attempted_flap_position` predicate.
- **Error Location**: Line 33, where the `->/2` operator is used in the rule:
  ```prolog
  (G > PrevPos -> Dir is Strength ; Dir is -Strength)
  ```
- **Root Cause**: The `->/2` operator is not recognized or improperly defined in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for calculating the flap position (`attempted_flap_position`) is sound but relies on Prolog's `->/2` operator, which may not be fully supported in ProbLog.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The model correctly defines probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect`, `use_actuator`) and adheres to probabilistic rules (`P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used. The model is purely probabilistic.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The model's logic is correct, but the `->/2` operator causes a failure.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Fully met. Probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The `->/2` operator is not supported in ProbLog, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` for `->/2` | Model evaluation fails         | Replace `->/2` with `if-then-else` logic. |
| 2   | No query results           | Unable to verify correctness  | Fix the `->/2` issue and re-run tests.    |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the problematic line with an equivalent `if-then-else` construct supported by ProbLog:
```prolog
Dir is (G > PrevPos ? Strength : -Strength)
```

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The model's probabilistic reasoning is correct, but the use of unsupported Prolog operators (`->/2`) must be addressed to ensure successful execution.
