  "ErrorSummary": "The code block defines `refute/1` correctly but lacks implementations for other required predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`). The test results show failures for all extended predicates.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Add the following predicates to the module:\n1. `implies(A, B) :- \\+ (A, \\+ B).`\n2. `opposite(A) :- \\+ A.`\n3. `includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).`\n4. `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).`\n5. Ensure `expand/2` is integrated into `prove/1` by adding `prove(expand(X, Y)) :- expand(X, Y).`",

  "NeedRegenerate": true
