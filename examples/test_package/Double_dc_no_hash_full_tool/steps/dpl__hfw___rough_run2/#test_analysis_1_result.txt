### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The images are mapped to numbers and operators, and the system recursively evaluates the expression. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze edge cases, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The result matches the expected output (`11.666666666666668`), and the probability is `1.0000`, indicating certainty.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, `detect_all/2`, `almost_equal/2`, `expression/2`, and `parse/2` are correctly defined and function as intended.  
  - The recursive termination in `parse/2` is ensured by the base case `parse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R).` and the recursive cases for each operator.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The logical correctness is confirmed as the code correctly parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base case and the reduction of the list in each recursive step.  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.  
  - The result probability is `1.0000`, indicating deterministic reasoning.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly evaluates arithmetic expressions.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs or invalid images (e.g., `image_unknown`) are not handled.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for typical expressions but may degrade for very long lists.  
  - **Division by Zero**: The code does not explicitly handle division by zero, which could lead to runtime errors.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined Input Handling | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation predicates.   |
| 2      | Division by Zero         | Runtime error                  | Add a check for zero denominator.  |
| 3      | Deep Recursion           | Performance degradation        | Optimize or limit recursion depth. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The code meets its primary functional requirements but could benefit from additional robustness checks for edge cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
