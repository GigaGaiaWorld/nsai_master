### Evaluation Report: Query Population and Area Database

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Population Density Query in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code is a Prolog program designed to query a database of countries' populations and areas to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division and ensures the results are within a 5% margin of each other. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with the requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
1. `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
2. `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
3. `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
4. `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the expected behavior, as the pairs of countries listed have population densities within the specified 5% margin.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned the expected output with a probability of 1.0000, indicating full confidence in the results.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `density/2`: Correctly calculates the population density using integer arithmetic.  
- `query_pop/1`: Correctly filters pairs of countries with approximately equal densities.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The logical correctness of the predicates is confirmed. The `density/2` predicate accurately computes the population density, and the `query_pop/1` predicate correctly applies the inequality constraints to filter results.  
- Recursive termination is not applicable here, as the program does not use recursion.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The program does not use probabilistic facts or negations/implications, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The program correctly queries and filters the database based on the given constraints.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** The predicates `pop/2` and `area/2` are fully defined for all listed countries.  
- **Non-list Input:** The input format for `query_pop/1` is strictly enforced as a list of four elements.  
- **Performance:** The program is efficient, with no deep recursion or performance bottlenecks.
