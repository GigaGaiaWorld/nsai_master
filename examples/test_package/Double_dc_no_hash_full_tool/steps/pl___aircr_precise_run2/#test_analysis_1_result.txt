### Aircraft Flap Controller Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog program models an aircraft flap controller, where the flap's position is adjusted over time based on actuator strength and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to position 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical rules, and edge cases in the program.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query                 | Probability Result |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`     | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`     | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`     | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`     | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`     | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)`| 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)`| 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)`| 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)`| 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)`| 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the likelihood of overrun exceptions increases slightly.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. Specifically:  
- The `attempted_flap_position` rule correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength and wind effects.  
- The `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` predicates accurately reflect the system's state at each time step.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The program ensures that the flap's position is updated only if the new position is legal (`legal_flap_position`). Recursive termination is guaranteed by the `Time > 0` condition.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilities of wind effects and actuator usage comply with the rules of probability theory (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). For example, the wind strength model ensures that the probabilities sum to 1.  

**DeepProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Neural Network Integration:** The program does not use DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The program correctly models the flap's movement and checks for goal achievement and overrun exceptions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts (e.g., actuator selection, wind effects) are correctly integrated into the reasoning process.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the program.  
- **Non-list Input:** The program does not handle lists, so this is irrelevant.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The program is logically and probabilistically sound, with no errors detected. The test results confirm its correctness.
