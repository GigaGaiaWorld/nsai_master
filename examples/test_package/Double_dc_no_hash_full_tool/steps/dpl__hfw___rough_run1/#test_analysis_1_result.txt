### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The images are mapped to numbers and operators, and the system recursively evaluates the expression. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The result matches the expected evaluation of the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, which simplifies to `0.666... + 3 - 14 = -10.333...`. However, the actual result (`11.666...`) is incorrect.  

**Conclusion**:  
The test fails due to an incorrect calculation. The expected result should be `-10.333...`.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect value.  
- **Faulty Predicate**:  
  The `parse/2` rules for arithmetic operations (lines 1â€“16 in the `<Code_Block>` section) do not account for operator precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).  
- **Code Line Numbers**:  
  The issue lies in the recursive parsing logic, which processes operations left-to-right without considering precedence.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The code fails to enforce operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluations. For example, `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7` is evaluated as `((2 / 3) + 3) - (2 * 7)` instead of `(2 / 3) + (3 - (2 * 7))`.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion terminates correctly, but the intermediate calculations are flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  

**DeepProbLog Feature**:  
Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code parses and evaluates expressions but fails to handle operator precedence.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined images are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for very long expressions.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong calculation results       | Rewrite `parse/2` to handle precedence (e.g., using a shunting-yard algorithm). |
| 2      | No input validation              | Crashes on invalid inputs      | Add checks for list structure and valid images. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**:  
The code requires modifications to handle operator precedence and input validation. The current implementation is logically flawed for arithmetic expressions with mixed operations.
