### Evaluation Report: Analysis of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Parsing Arithmetic Expressions**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, ...]`) into their corresponding numerical results. The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `detect_all/2` to map images to symbols and then parses these symbols into arithmetic expressions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The query returns a probability of `0.0000`, indicating a failure to compute the correct result. The expected result should be a numerical value derived from the arithmetic expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` fails to produce the correct arithmetic result.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It only handles single-number lists (`parse([N], R)`) but does not define rules for parsing arithmetic operations (e.g., `[N, O, M]` where `O` is an operator).
  - **Code Line:** The issue lies in the missing rules for `parse/2` to handle arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `parse/2` predicate lacks rules for evaluating arithmetic expressions. For example, it should recursively parse sub-expressions and apply operators.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The current implementation does not support recursion for parsing nested or multi-operation expressions.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog Integration:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code correctly maps images to symbols but fails to parse arithmetic expressions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs or undefined operators are not handled.
  - Deep recursion for long expressions is unsupported due to the incomplete `parse/2` predicate.

#### **8. Conclusion**
The code successfully maps images to symbols but fails to parse arithmetic expressions due to an incomplete `parse/2` predicate. To fix this, implement rules for parsing arithmetic operations and handle edge cases. The evaluation confirms that the code does not use DeepProbLog features or probabilistic reasoning. Addressing these issues will ensure the code meets its functional requirements.
