{
  "HASH": "FB41E2F7",
  "ErrorSummary": "Incomplete parse/2 predicate; lacks rules for parsing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).",
  "SuggestedFix": "Add the following rules to parse/2:\n1. parse([N, O, M], R) :- almost_equal(N, N1), almost_equal(M, M1), (O = '+' -> R is N1 + M1; O = '-' -> R is N1 - M1; O = '*' -> R is N1 * M1; O = '/' -> R is N1 / M1).\n2. Extend recursively for longer lists by splitting into sub-expressions (e.g., parse([N, O | T], R) :- parse([N], N1), parse([O | T], R1), R is N1 + R1).",
