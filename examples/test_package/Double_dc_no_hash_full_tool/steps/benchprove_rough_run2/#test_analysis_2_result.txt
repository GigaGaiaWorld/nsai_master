### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a basic meta-interpreter for ProbLog, along with extended logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the meta-interpreter and extended predicates.  
- Analyze the test results for logical and probabilistic consistency.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules and classical logic.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob))) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (returned `0.0000`).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failures indicate that none of the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) are correctly defined or integrated into the meta-interpreter. The specific issues are:  
- **Missing Definitions:** The predicates `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `includes/2`, and `extend/3` are not defined in the code.  
- **Incorrect `expand/2` Usage:** While `expand/2` is defined for arithmetic operations (`double/1`, `square/1`), it is not used in the meta-interpreter's `prove/1` logic.  
- **No Probabilistic Facts:** The results suggest that the meta-interpreter does not handle probabilistic facts or negation correctly.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The meta-interpreter (`prove/1`) is correctly defined for basic goals and compound goals (`A,B`). However, it lacks support for the extended predicates.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` and `prove/1` predicates are correctly implemented and terminate as expected.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Negation and Implication:** The meta-interpreter does not implement probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (basic meta-interpreter works, but extended predicates are missing).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (no probabilistic facts or rules are handled).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Undefined `expand/2` for non-arithmetic goals.  
- Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` are not handled.  
- Deep recursion performance is untested.

**Final Note:** The meta-interpreter framework is sound, but the extended predicates and probabilistic features must be implemented to meet the requirements.
