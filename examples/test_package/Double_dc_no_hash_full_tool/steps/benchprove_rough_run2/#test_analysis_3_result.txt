### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a meta-interpreter for proving goals and extends it with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:  

| Query | Result (Probability) |
|-------|----------------------|
| `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(expand(double(3),6)` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(includes([a, b, c],b)` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` | 0.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (probability = 0.0000 for all queries).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failures indicate that none of the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) are correctly defined or implemented. The specific issues are:  

1. **`implies/2`**: Not defined in the code.  
2. **`opposite/1`**: Not defined in the code.  
3. **`expand/2`**: Defined for `double` and `square`, but not integrated into the meta-interpreter.  
4. **`includes/2`**: Not defined in the code.  
5. **`extend/3`**: Not defined in the code.  

The `refute/1` predicate is correctly defined but not tested in the provided queries.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The meta-interpreter (`prove/1`) is correctly implemented for basic goals and compound goals (`A,B`). However, the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) are missing, leading to failures.  
  - Recursive termination is correct for `member/2` and `prove/1`, but the lack of definitions for extended predicates prevents proper execution.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not include probabilistic facts or rules, so probabilistic implications (`P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`) are not applicable here.  
  - The `refute/1` predicate uses negation (`\+`), which is valid in classical ProbLog but not tested.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (basic `prove/1` works, but extended predicates are missing).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2` for non-numeric inputs.  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` would fail.  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be an issue for large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `implies/2` not defined | All implication queries fail | Implement `implies(A,B) :- \+ (A, \+ B).` |
| 2   | `opposite/1` not defined | All opposite queries fail | Implement `opposite(A) :- \+ A.` |
| 3   | `includes/2` not defined | All inclusion queries fail | Implement `includes(X, [X|_]). includes(X, [_|T]) :- includes(X, T).` |
| 4   | `extend/3` not defined | All extension queries fail | Implement `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).` |
| 5   | `expand/2` not integrated | Expand queries fail | Ensure `expand/2` is called within `prove/1`. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revisions to implement the missing predicates and integrate them with the meta-interpreter. The current implementation does not meet the extended logic processing requirements.
