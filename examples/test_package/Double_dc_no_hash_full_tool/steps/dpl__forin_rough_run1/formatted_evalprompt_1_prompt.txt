.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog program implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) to sort a list of integers. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical Prolog reasoning. The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was executed:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  
  The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
  The program correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm, and the test case validates its functionality.  
- **Expansion Predicates:**  
  The program does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so no verification is required for these.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
  - **Logical Correctness:**  
    The program is logically correct. The `insert/3` predicate ensures that each element is inserted into the correct position in the accumulator list (`Acc`), and the recursion terminates when the input list is empty.  
  - **Recursive Termination:**  
    The recursion terminates because the input list is progressively reduced (`[H|T]` to `T`) until it becomes empty (`[]`).  

- **ProbLog Scenarios:**  
  - The program does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
    The program does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
    **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The program correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The program assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) would cause errors.  
  - **Empty List:** The program handles this case correctly (`insertion_sort([], []).`).  
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists could lead to stack overflow, but this is a general limitation of Prolog's recursion model.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Program may fail unexpectedly   | Add input validation for lists      |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Consider iterative implementation  |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` program is functionally correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
