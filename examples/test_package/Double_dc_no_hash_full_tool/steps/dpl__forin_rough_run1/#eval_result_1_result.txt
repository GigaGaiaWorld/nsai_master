{"HASH": "501F546D", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. Edge cases (non-list inputs, deep recursion) are not handled but are not required by the original specifications.", "SuggestedFix": "None needed for current requirements. For robustness, consider adding input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` checks) and an iterative implementation for large lists.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
