### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog program implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) to sort a list of integers. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical Prolog reasoning. The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was executed:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  
  The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
  The program correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm, and the test case validates its functionality.  
- **Expansion Predicates:**  
  The program does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so no verification is required for these.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
  - **Logical Correctness:**  
    The program is logically correct. The `insert/3` predicate ensures that each element is inserted into the correct position in the accumulator list (`Acc`), and the recursion terminates when the input list is empty.  
  - **Recursive Termination:**  
    The recursion terminates because the input list is progressively reduced (`[H|T]` to `T`) until it becomes empty (`[]`).  

- **ProbLog Scenarios:**  
  - The program does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
    The program does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
    **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The program correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The program assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) would cause errors.  
  - **Empty List:** The program handles this case correctly (`insertion_sort([], []).`).  
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists could lead to stack overflow, but this is a general limitation of Prolog's recursion model.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Program may fail unexpectedly   | Add input validation for lists      |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Consider iterative implementation  |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` program is functionally correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
