</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Model: Error Localization and Root Cause Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with the goal of reaching a target position. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the model, analyze test failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure during evaluation with the error:  
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 33:197.
```  
This suggests a syntax or logical error in the code, preventing the model from executing successfully. No queries were evaluated due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs at line 33, column 197, indicating a missing or malformed clause.  
- **Specific Predicate/Rule**: The issue lies in the `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate, where the arrow operator `->` is incorrectly used or missing a clause.  
- **Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator), 
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength), 
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect), 
    goal(G), 
    Delta is G - PrevPos, 
    (Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1), 
    Move is Direction * Strength + WindEffect, 
    Pos is PrevPos + Move.
  ```  
  The error suggests the `->` operator is not properly handled or lacks a valid clause.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate is logically sound but may have a syntax issue with the `->` operator.  
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The model uses probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`) correctly, but the error prevents their evaluation.  
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion in `flap_position/2` and `attempted_flap_position/2` is well-defined and terminates when the goal is reached or an overrun occurs.  
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is used; the model is purely probabilistic.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (error prevents full evaluation).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Partially met (error prevents evaluation of probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The `legal_flap_position/1` predicate ensures valid positions, but the error prevents testing edge cases (e.g., overrun).  
  - The `wind_effect/2` distribution is correctly defined but untested due to the error.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `->` operator    | Prevents model execution        | Verify and correct the `->` clause. |
| 2   | Missing clause for `->`          | Halts query evaluation          | Ensure all operators are properly defined. |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The model's logical structure is sound, but a syntax error in the `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate prevents execution. Correcting the `->` operator will resolve the issue and allow further testing.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
