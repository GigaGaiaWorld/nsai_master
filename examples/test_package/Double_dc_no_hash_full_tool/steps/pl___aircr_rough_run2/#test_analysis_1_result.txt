### Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Model: Error Localization and Root Cause Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with the goal of reaching a target position. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the model, analyze test failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure during evaluation with the error:  
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 33:197.
```  
This suggests a syntax or logical error in the code, preventing the model from executing successfully. No queries were evaluated due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs at line 33, column 197, indicating a missing or malformed clause.  
- **Specific Predicate/Rule**: The issue lies in the `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate, where the arrow operator `->` is incorrectly used or missing a clause.  
- **Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos), 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator), 
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength), 
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect), 
    goal(G), 
    Delta is G - PrevPos, 
    (Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1), 
    Move is Direction * Strength + WindEffect, 
    Pos is PrevPos + Move.
  ```  
  The error suggests the `->` operator is not properly handled or lacks a valid clause.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate is logically sound but may have a syntax issue with the `->` operator.  
- **Probabilistic Rules**: The model uses probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`) correctly, but the error prevents their evaluation.  
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion in `flap_position/2` and `attempted_flap_position/2` is well-defined and terminates when the goal is reached or an overrun occurs.  
- **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is used; the model is purely probabilistic.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (error prevents full evaluation).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Partially met (error prevents evaluation of probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The `legal_flap_position/1` predicate ensures valid positions, but the error prevents testing edge cases (e.g., overrun).  
  - The `wind_effect/2` distribution is correctly defined but untested due to the error.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `->` operator    | Prevents model execution        | Verify and correct the `->` clause. |
| 2   | Missing clause for `->`          | Halts query evaluation          | Ensure all operators are properly defined. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The model's logical structure is sound, but a syntax error in the `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate prevents execution. Correcting the `->` operator will resolve the issue and allow further testing.
