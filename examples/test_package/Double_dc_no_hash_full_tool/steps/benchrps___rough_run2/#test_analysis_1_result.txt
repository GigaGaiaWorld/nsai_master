### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and evaluates the outcome of a series of moves between two players. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the game logic, test the functionality of the predicates, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules in ProbLog.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
```
**Verification:**  
- The result is correct because:  
  - Player 1's moves: `[rock, rock, rock]`  
  - Player 2's moves: `[paper, paper, scissor]`  
  - Outcomes: `[lose, lose, win]`  
  - Score: `-1 (lose) + -1 (lose) + 1 (win) = -1`  
  - Winner: `player2`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures).

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `play_round/3`, `play/3`, and `compute_score/2` function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `play_round/3` correctly model the game's win-lose relationships.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `play/3` predicate terminates correctly when the input lists are empty.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The game logic is correctly implemented.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input moves are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth equals the length of the move lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.
