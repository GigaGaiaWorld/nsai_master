 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],[1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],[3, 1, 2, 4]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Stack Operations Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implemented operations.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [3,1,2,4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected behavior for each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates (`stack_op/3`) function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for each stack operation are logically sound. For example:
  - `push(X)` correctly prepends `X` to the stack.
  - `pop` removes the top element.
  - `dup` duplicates the top element.
  - `swap`, `over`, and `rot` manipulate the top elements as specified.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** Since the code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations are correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid stack inputs (lists). Non-list inputs would fail.
  - **Performance:** Recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not a concern.
  - **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `swap`, etc., would fail if the stack is empty or has insufficient elements.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

---

**Word Count:** 350 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. Edge cases (e.g., empty stack) should be handled for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
