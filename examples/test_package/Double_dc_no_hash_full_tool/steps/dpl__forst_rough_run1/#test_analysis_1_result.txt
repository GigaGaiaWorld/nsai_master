### Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Stack Operations Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implemented operations.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [3,1,2,4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected behavior for each stack operation.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates (`stack_op/3`) function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for each stack operation are logically sound. For example:
  - `push(X)` correctly prepends `X` to the stack.
  - `pop` removes the top element.
  - `dup` duplicates the top element.
  - `swap`, `over`, and `rot` manipulate the top elements as specified.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** Since the code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations are correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid stack inputs (lists). Non-list inputs would fail.
  - **Performance:** Recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not a concern.
  - **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `swap`, etc., would fail if the stack is empty or has insufficient elements.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

**Word Count:** 350 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. Edge cases (e.g., empty stack) should be handled for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
