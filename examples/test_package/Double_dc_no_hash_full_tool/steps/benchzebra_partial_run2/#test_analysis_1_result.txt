#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on the correctness of the logical constraints, the accuracy of the test results, and the adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test result for the `zebra/1` predicate is as follows:  
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```  
- **Verification**: The result satisfies all the constraints specified in the puzzle (e.g., the Norwegian lives next to the blue house, the Spanish has a dog, etc.).  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. However, the following predicates and rules were verified:  
- `my_member/2`: Correctly checks membership in the list.  
- `right_of/3` and `next_to/3`: Correctly enforce spatial relationships between houses.  
- All constraints (e.g., `house(red, english, _, _, _)`) are correctly implemented.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog**:  
  - The logical constraints are correctly implemented, and the recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) terminate as expected.  
  - No edge cases (e.g., empty lists or invalid inputs) are overlooked.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:  
  - The puzzle does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly encoded and solved.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this implementation.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The implementation assumes valid input (a list of 5 houses). Non-list inputs or lists of incorrect length would cause errors.  
  - Recursive predicates are safe as they terminate when the list is exhausted.

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The implementation is correct and adheres to the puzzle's requirements. No issues were identified during testing.
