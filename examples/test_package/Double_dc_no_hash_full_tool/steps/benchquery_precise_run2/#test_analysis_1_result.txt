### Evaluation Report: Population Density Query Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Population Density Query in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations, ensuring robustness. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following queries and their return values (all with a probability of `1.0000`):  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246])`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219])`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223])`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77])`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461])`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244])`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477])`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76])`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities, as defined by the inequality `20×D1 < 21×D2`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the expansion predicates (e.g., `pop/2`, `area/2`) are accurately defined.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density using integer arithmetic (`D is (P * 100) // A`).  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the densities of two distinct countries (`C1 \= C2`) are approximately equal (`20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1`).  

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The test results show deterministic outcomes (`1.0000`), indicating no probabilistic facts or negations are involved. The analysis confirms compliance with classical Problog rules.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All required predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`) are defined.  
  - **Non-list Input:** The query assumes a list input format (`[C1,D1,C2,D2]`), but no edge cases were tested for invalid inputs.  
  - **Performance:** The query is non-recursive and performs efficiently for the given dataset.
