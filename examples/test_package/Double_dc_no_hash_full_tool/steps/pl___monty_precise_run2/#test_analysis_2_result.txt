### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the problem's requirements. The code includes probabilistic facts, rules for door selection and opening, and queries to test winning strategies ("keep" or "switch").

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error for the predicate `,/2`. No queries were successfully evaluated, and the error suggests a syntax or predicate definition issue.  

**Failed Queries:**  
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed due to the `UnknownClause` error.  

**Expected Results:**  
- `prize(_)` should return probabilities for each door (1/3 each).  
- `select_door(1)` should succeed with probability 1.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` should return probabilities reflecting the Monty Hall problem's outcomes (1/3 for `win_keep`, 2/3 for `win_switch`).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the rule for `open_door(A)`, specifically due to a malformed rule definition. The problematic code block is:  
```problog
open_door(A) :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), \+ prize(A), forall(member(B, [1,2,3]), (\+ select_door(B), prize(B))).
```  
**Issues:**  
1. **Syntax Error:** The `forall/2` predicate is not correctly formatted, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  
2. **Logical Error:** The rule does not correctly implement the Monty Hall problem's requirement to open a door that is neither selected nor contains the prize.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined, but the `open_door/1` rule fails due to incorrect use of `forall/2`.  
  - Recursive termination is not an issue here, but the rule's logic is flawed.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined.  
  - The negation (`\+`) and implication logic in `open_door/1` does not comply with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (flawed `open_door/1` rule).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met (correct facts, flawed rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `open_door/1` rule does not handle cases where only one door is unselected and does not contain a prize.  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are not addressed.

|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` for `,/2`       | All queries fail                | Fix syntax in `open_door/1` rule, replace `forall/2` with correct logic.   |
| 2   | Incorrect `open_door/1` logic   | Monty Hall rules violated       | Rewrite the rule to ensure it opens a valid door with probability 1.       |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features         | N/A                             | Not applicable for this implementation.                                    |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation fails due to syntax and logical errors in the `open_door/1` rule. Correcting these issues and ensuring the rule adheres to the Monty Hall problem's requirements will resolve the failures. No DeepProbLog features are used.
