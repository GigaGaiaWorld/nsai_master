<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and adherence to the problem's requirements. The code includes probabilistic facts, rules for door selection and opening, and queries to test winning strategies ("keep" or "switch").

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error for the predicate `,/2`. No queries were successfully evaluated, and the error suggests a syntax or predicate definition issue.  

**Failed Queries:**  
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) failed due to the `UnknownClause` error.  

**Expected Results:**  
- `prize(_)` should return probabilities for each door (1/3 each).  
- `select_door(1)` should succeed with probability 1.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` should return probabilities reflecting the Monty Hall problem's outcomes (1/3 for `win_keep`, 2/3 for `win_switch`).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the rule for `open_door(A)`, specifically due to a malformed rule definition. The problematic code block is:  
```problog
open_door(A) :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), \+ prize(A), forall(member(B, [1,2,3]), (\+ select_door(B), prize(B))).
```  
**Issues:**  
1. **Syntax Error:** The `forall/2` predicate is not correctly formatted, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  
2. **Logical Error:** The rule does not correctly implement the Monty Hall problem's requirement to open a door that is neither selected nor contains the prize.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined, but the `open_door/1` rule fails due to incorrect use of `forall/2`.  
  - Recursive termination is not an issue here, but the rule's logic is flawed.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
  - The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined.  
  - The negation (`\+`) and implication logic in `open_door/1` does not comply with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (flawed `open_door/1` rule).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met (correct facts, flawed rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `open_door/1` rule does not handle cases where only one door is unselected and does not contain a prize.  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are not addressed.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` for `,/2`       | All queries fail                | Fix syntax in `open_door/1` rule, replace `forall/2` with correct logic.   |
| 2   | Incorrect `open_door/1` logic   | Monty Hall rules violated       | Rewrite the rule to ensure it opens a valid door with probability 1.       |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features         | N/A                             | Not applicable for this implementation.                                    |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation fails due to syntax and logical errors in the `open_door/1` rule. Correcting these issues and ensuring the rule adheres to the Monty Hall problem's requirements will resolve the failures. No DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
