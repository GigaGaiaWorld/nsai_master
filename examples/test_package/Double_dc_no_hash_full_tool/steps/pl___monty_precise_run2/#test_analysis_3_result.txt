### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch their selection. The ProbLog implementation provided models this scenario, including the probabilistic selection of the prize, the contestant's initial choice, and the host's action of opening a door. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation and its alignment with the expected probabilistic outcomes.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query             | Probability Result |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `prize(1)`        | 0.3333             |
| `prize(2)`        | 0.3333             |
| `prize(3)`        | 0.3333             |
| `select_door(1)`  | 1.0000             |
| `win_keep`        | 0.3333             |
| `win_switch`      | 0.6667             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities:  
- The prize is equally likely behind any of the three doors (`prize/1`).  
- The contestant always selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).  
- The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is 1/3.  
- The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is 2/3.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided implementation. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Logical Correctness:**  
- The rules for `open_door/1` correctly handle the host's action of opening a door that is neither selected nor contains the prize. The deterministic case (when only one such door exists) is also correctly implemented.  
- The predicates `win_keep` and `win_switch` accurately model the contestant's outcomes based on their choice to stay or switch.  

**Probabilistic Correctness:**  
- The probabilities of `prize/1` are uniformly distributed (1/3 each), as required.  
- The negation and implication rules are implicitly correct, as evidenced by the results of `win_keep` and `win_switch`.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- The implementation does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** The implementation correctly models the logical aspects of the Monty Hall problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The probabilities are computed accurately, and the results match theoretical expectations.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog features not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The implementation assumes valid inputs (e.g., `select_door/1` is always called with a valid door number).  
- The recursive `member/2` predicate is correctly implemented and terminates for finite lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is robust and correctly models the Monty Hall problem. No issues were identified during testing. The results align with theoretical expectations, and the code is logically and probabilistically sound.
