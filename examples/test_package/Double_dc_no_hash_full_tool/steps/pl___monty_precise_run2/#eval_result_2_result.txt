  "HASH": "B4161B21",
  "ErrorSummary": "Syntax error in `open_door/1` rule due to incorrect use of `forall/2`. Logical error in rule implementation, failing to correctly open a door that is neither selected nor contains the prize.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the `open_door/1` rule with: `open_door(A) :- member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), \+ prize(A), member(B, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(B), prize(B), A \= B.` This ensures the rule opens a valid door with probability 1 when only one unselected door does not contain the prize.",
