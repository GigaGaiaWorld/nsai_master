### Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubble Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code aims to implement a bubble sort algorithm (`bubblesort/3`) and a wrapper predicate (`forth_sort/2`) to sort a list. The code was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`, but an error occurred during execution. This report analyzes the test results, identifies the root cause of the failure, and evaluates the code's compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:15.
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: The test failed due to a syntax error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `bubble/3`  
  - **Line Number**: 4 (specifically, the `->` operator usage)  
- **Actual vs. Expected**:  
  - **Actual**: The code fails to execute due to incorrect usage of the `->` operator.  
  - **Expected**: The `->` operator should be used within a valid conditional construct, but the syntax is malformed.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `bubble/3` predicate attempts to implement a conditional swap using `->`, but the syntax is incorrect. The parentheses and semicolon (`;`) are misplaced, leading to a parsing error.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The base cases (`bubble([], [], [])` and `bubble([X], [], X)`) are correctly defined, but the recursive case is flawed.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The algorithm's logic is conceptually correct, but the implementation contains a syntax error.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is proportional to the input list length, which could lead to performance issues for large lists.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are used.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `->` operator    | Code fails to execute           | Correct the syntax of the conditional construct in `bubble/3`.             |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation to ensure the argument is a list.                     |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists   | Performance issues              | Optimize the algorithm or use tail recursion if possible.                  |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**  
Here is the corrected version of the `bubble/3` predicate:  
```prolog
bubble([], [], []).
bubble([X], [], X).
bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :-
    (H1 =< H2 -> 
        X1 = H1, bubble([H2 | T], T1, X)
    ; 
        X1 = H2, bubble([H1 | T], T1, X)
    ).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The code fails due to a syntax error in the conditional construct of the `bubble/3` predicate. After correction, the algorithm should work as intended. Edge cases and performance considerations should be addressed for robustness.
