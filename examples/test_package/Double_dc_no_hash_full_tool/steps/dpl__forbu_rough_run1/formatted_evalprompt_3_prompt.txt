 Error evaluating Problog model:

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1282, in collapse
    raise UnmatchedCharacter(string, expr_stack[-1].start.location)
problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character '(' at 4:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code aims to implement a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog. The goal is to sort a list of integers in ascending order. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`
- **Result:** The test failed due to a syntax error (`Unmatched character '(' at 4:5`).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`
- **Error Location:** 
  - **Code Block:** The error occurs in the `bubble/3` predicate, specifically at line 4, column 5.
  - **Issue:** The predicate definition contains unmatched parentheses, leading to a parsing error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the bubblesort algorithm is partially correct but flawed due to syntax errors.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`bubble([], [], [])` and `bubble([X], [], X)`) are correctly defined, but the recursive case is syntactically invalid.
- **ProbLog Scenario:**
  - **Probabilistic Rules:** Not applicable here, as the code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical structure is correct, but syntax errors prevent execution).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code does not handle non-list inputs or empty lists gracefully.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursive implementation may lead to performance issues for large lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| **No.** | **Problem**                     | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Unmatched parentheses in `bubble/3` | Syntax error prevents execution     | Correct the predicate definition by ensuring all parentheses are properly closed. |
| 2       | No error handling for non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors            | Add input validation to ensure the input is a list.                             |
| 3       | Deep recursion for large lists  | Performance issues                  | Optimize the algorithm or use tail recursion to improve efficiency.             |

---

### **Conclusion**
The current implementation of bubblesort in Prolog contains critical syntax errors that prevent it from executing. Once these are fixed, the logical structure appears sound, but additional improvements are needed for robustness and performance. The code does not utilize any ProbLog or DeepProbLog features. Addressing the identified issues will ensure the algorithm works as intended. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
