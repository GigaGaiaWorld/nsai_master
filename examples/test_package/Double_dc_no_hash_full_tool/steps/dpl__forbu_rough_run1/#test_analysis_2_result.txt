### Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog with Test Failures**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a bubblesort algorithm (`bubblesort/3`) and a wrapper predicate (`forth_sort/2`) to sort a list. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test failures, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
  problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:15.
  ```  
- **Interpretation**: The test failed due to an unrecognized operator (`->/2`) in the ProbLog engine.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `bubble/3`  
  - **Line Interval**: Line 4 (`(H1 =< H2 -> ...)`).  
- **Issue**: The ProbLog engine does not recognize the Prolog conditional operator (`->/2`), which is valid in standard Prolog but not in ProbLog.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The code is logically correct for standard Prolog, as it uses the conditional operator (`->/2`) to implement the bubblesort algorithm.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`bubble([], [], [])` and `bubble([X], [], X)`).  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog does not support the Prolog conditional operator (`->/2`), leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  
  - ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`), which are not used here.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - **Result**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails in ProbLog due to unsupported operator).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: Not handled (e.g., `forth_sort(3, X)` would fail).  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very long lists.  
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` in ProbLog    | ProbLog execution fails         | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | No probabilistic rules           | ProbLog features unused         | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed. |
| 3   | Non-list input not handled       | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).   |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The bubblesort implementation is correct for standard Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the unsupported conditional operator. To resolve this, replace `->/2` with a ProbLog-compatible alternative. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases (e.g., non-list input) should be addressed for robustness.
