           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:15.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubble Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code aims to implement a bubble sort algorithm (`bubblesort/3`) and a wrapper predicate (`forth_sort/2`) to sort a list. The code was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`, but an error occurred during execution. This report analyzes the test results, identifies the root cause of the failure, and evaluates the code's compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result**:  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:15.
  ```  
- **Conclusion**: The test failed due to a syntax error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `bubble/3`  
  - **Line Number**: 4 (specifically, the `->` operator usage)  
- **Actual vs. Expected**:  
  - **Actual**: The code fails to execute due to incorrect usage of the `->` operator.  
  - **Expected**: The `->` operator should be used within a valid conditional construct, but the syntax is malformed.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `bubble/3` predicate attempts to implement a conditional swap using `->`, but the syntax is incorrect. The parentheses and semicolon (`;`) are misplaced, leading to a parsing error.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The base cases (`bubble([], [], [])` and `bubble([X], [], X)`) are correctly defined, but the recursive case is flawed.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The algorithm's logic is conceptually correct, but the implementation contains a syntax error.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is proportional to the input list length, which could lead to performance issues for large lists.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `->` operator    | Code fails to execute           | Correct the syntax of the conditional construct in `bubble/3`.             |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation to ensure the argument is a list.                     |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists   | Performance issues              | Optimize the algorithm or use tail recursion if possible.                  |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code**  
Here is the corrected version of the `bubble/3` predicate:  
```prolog
bubble([], [], []).
bubble([X], [], X).
bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :-
    (H1 =< H2 -> 
        X1 = H1, bubble([H2 | T], T1, X)
    ; 
        X1 = H2, bubble([H1 | T], T1, X)
    ).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The code fails due to a syntax error in the conditional construct of the `bubble/3` predicate. After correction, the algorithm should work as intended. Edge cases and performance considerations should be addressed for robustness.  

**Word Count**: ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
