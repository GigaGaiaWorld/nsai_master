### **Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code aims to implement a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog. The goal is to sort a list of integers in ascending order. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`
- **Result:** The test failed due to a syntax error (`Unmatched character '(' at 4:5`).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`
- **Error Location:** 
  - **Code Block:** The error occurs in the `bubble/3` predicate, specifically at line 4, column 5.
  - **Issue:** The predicate definition contains unmatched parentheses, leading to a parsing error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the bubblesort algorithm is partially correct but flawed due to syntax errors.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`bubble([], [], [])` and `bubble([X], [], X)`) are correctly defined, but the recursive case is syntactically invalid.
- **ProbLog Scenario:**
  - **Probabilistic Rules:** Not applicable here, as the code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical structure is correct, but syntax errors prevent execution).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code does not handle non-list inputs or empty lists gracefully.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursive implementation may lead to performance issues for large lists.

| **No.** | **Problem**                     | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Unmatched parentheses in `bubble/3` | Syntax error prevents execution     | Correct the predicate definition by ensuring all parentheses are properly closed. |
| 2       | No error handling for non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors            | Add input validation to ensure the input is a list.                             |
| 3       | Deep recursion for large lists  | Performance issues                  | Optimize the algorithm or use tail recursion to improve efficiency.             |

### **Conclusion**
The current implementation of bubblesort in Prolog contains critical syntax errors that prevent it from executing. Once these are fixed, the logical structure appears sound, but additional improvements are needed for robustness and performance. The code does not utilize any ProbLog or DeepProbLog features. Addressing the identified issues will ensure the algorithm works as intended.
