#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` must hold under the following constraints:  
1. Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9).  
2. The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
3. The addition must account for carry-over between columns.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each query returns a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the constraints are satisfied for the given solutions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`: Ensure digits are valid and first digits are non-zero.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly handles column-wise addition and carry-over.  

All predicates are correctly defined and function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle is sound. The constraints (`leftdigit`, `all_different`, and `sumdigit`) are correctly implemented.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates as the list shrinks with each recursive call.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are applicable.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly enforced.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid input lists of length 5. Non-list inputs or lists of incorrect length would fail.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the list length (5), so performance is not an issue.  

**Suggestions:**  
- Add input validation for the list length.  
- Consider extending the puzzle to handle more complex equations or probabilistic constraints.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and robust for the given cryptoaddition puzzle. No failures were detected, and all requirements are met. Future work could explore extending the puzzle or integrating probabilistic reasoning.
