### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Insertion Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` function as intended.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Recursively sorts the tail list and inserts the head element into the sorted list.  
- `insert_element/3`: Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list while maintaining the order.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.  
  - The recursive case splits the list into head and tail, sorts the tail, and inserts the head into the sorted tail.  
  - The `insert_element/3` predicate handles insertion by comparing elements and placing them in the correct position.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the tail list `T` decreases in size with each recursive call until it becomes empty.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). The result is deterministic, as evidenced by the probability `1.0000`.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:**  
   - The implementation meets the requirements for classical reasoning. It correctly sorts the input list using insertion sort.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
   - Not applicable in this case, as the implementation is deterministic.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:**  
   - Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists may cause stack overflow or performance issues.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used in this implementation.

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists   | Optimize for tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Conclusion:**  
The insertion sort implementation in ProbLog is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks handling for edge cases such as non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
