### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of `digit/2` facts representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0 to 9). It also includes an `addition/3` rule to perform addition on these digits. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as the result matches the expected output (`5 + 6 = 11`).  
- **Conclusion**:  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**. The code correctly implements the addition logic for the given inputs.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The `addition/3` rule is logically correct. It retrieves the digits associated with the images and computes their sum.  
  - No recursion is used, so termination is not an issue.  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::digit(...)`). All facts are deterministic.  
  - No negations or implications are present, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used**. The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The `addition/3` rule correctly performs arithmetic operations.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle undefined inputs (e.g., `digit(img_10,10)`).  
  - No list inputs or recursive structures are involved, so performance is not a concern.

| Number | Problem                  | Impact               | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic facts   | Limited functionality| Add probabilistic rules if needed.  |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features  | No neural integration| Consider integrating `nn/3` for advanced tasks. |
| 3      | Undefined inputs         | Potential runtime errors | Validate inputs or add default cases. |

**Word Count**: ~350 words.  

**Final Notes**: The code is functionally correct for the given requirements but lacks advanced features like probabilistic reasoning or neural network integration. Edge cases should be addressed for robustness.
