</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```

**Verification**:  
- The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because:  
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.  
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.  
  - `rock` vs. `scissor`: Player 1 wins.  
  The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).  

**Conclusion**:  
All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates and rules function as expected.  

**Verified Predicates**:  
- `move/1`: Defines valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
- `beats/2`: Defines win-lose relationships.  
- `result/3`: Computes the outcome of a single round.  
- `play/3`: Recursively computes results for a list of moves.  
- `compute_score/2`: Calculates the final score.  
- `determine_winner/3`: Determines the winner based on the score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are logically sound.  
  - Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Empty lists are handled by `play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`.  
  - Non-list inputs are not explicitly checked but are not required for this implementation.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`).  
- No probabilistic implications or negations are present.  

**DeepProbLog Integration**:  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements**:  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

**Edge Cases**:  
- **Undefined Inputs**: Non-move inputs (e.g., `move(foo)`) are not handled.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion could be inefficient for very long move lists, but this is unlikely in practice.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No issues were found during testing.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
