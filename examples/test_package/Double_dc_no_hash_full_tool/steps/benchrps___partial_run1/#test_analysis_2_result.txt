### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Analysis Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the overall game result. The purpose of this analysis is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000, as `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a net score of -1 for `player1`.

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the test case aligns with the expected behavior.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The logical correctness of the rules (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3`) is verified.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base case `play([], [], [])` and the recursive step correctly processes each round.

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The rules correctly model the game's logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Non-list inputs or invalid gestures would cause errors.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion could be a concern for very long move lists, but this is unlikely in practice for this game.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~350 words.  

**Final Remarks**: The implementation is correct and robust for the given requirements. Future enhancements could include handling invalid inputs and extending the game with probabilistic features.
