### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```

**Verification**:  
- The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because:  
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.  
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.  
  - `rock` vs. `scissor`: Player 1 wins.  
  The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).  

**Conclusion**:  
All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates and rules function as expected.  

**Verified Predicates**:  
- `move/1`: Defines valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
- `beats/2`: Defines win-lose relationships.  
- `result/3`: Computes the outcome of a single round.  
- `play/3`: Recursively computes results for a list of moves.  
- `compute_score/2`: Calculates the final score.  
- `determine_winner/3`: Determines the winner based on the score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are logically sound.  
  - Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Empty lists are handled by `play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`.  
  - Non-list inputs are not explicitly checked but are not required for this implementation.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`).  
- No probabilistic implications or negations are present.  

**DeepProbLog Integration**:  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements**:  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

**Edge Cases**:  
- **Undefined Inputs**: Non-move inputs (e.g., `move(foo)`) are not handled.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion could be inefficient for very long move lists, but this is unlikely in practice.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No issues were found during testing.
