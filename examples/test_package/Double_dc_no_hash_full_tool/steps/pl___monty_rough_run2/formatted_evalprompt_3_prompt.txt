<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the chance to switch their choice. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and compute the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code results in an error during evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 11:16.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) fail due to the error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically at the line:
```prolog
0.5::open_door([A,B], A) ; 0.5::open_door([A,B], B).
```
The issue arises because the predicate `open_door/2` is not defined, but the code attempts to use it. The correct predicate should be `open_door/1` as per the requirements.

**Code Line Number Interval:**
- The error is localized to the line where `open_door/2` is incorrectly used (line 11).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to model the host's behavior, but the implementation incorrectly uses `open_door/2`. This violates the requirements and causes the evaluation to fail.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code attempts to use probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door([A,B], A)`) but does so incorrectly. The correct approach would involve defining `open_door/1` with probabilistic choices for the two-door case.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates, but the error prevents further evaluation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The `member/2` and `select_door/1` predicates are correctly defined.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The `prize/1` predicate is correctly defined, but the `open_door/1` predicate fails due to incorrect usage of `open_door/2`.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle the case where only one door is available (as required).
  - The code does not validate input types (e.g., non-list inputs for `member/2`).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Incorrect predicate (`open_door/2` used instead of `open_door/1`) | Evaluation fails | Replace `open_door/2` with `open_door/1` and define it as per requirements. |
| 2      | Missing case for single-door scenario in `open_door/1` | Incomplete functionality | Add a clause for the single-door case. |
| 3      | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for input types (e.g., lists for `member/2`). |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation fails due to an incorrect predicate definition (`open_door/2`). Correcting this and ensuring all edge cases are handled will resolve the issue. The probabilistic reasoning is otherwise sound, but the error prevents further evaluation. The report highlights the need for careful predicate definition and input validation in ProbLog programs.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
