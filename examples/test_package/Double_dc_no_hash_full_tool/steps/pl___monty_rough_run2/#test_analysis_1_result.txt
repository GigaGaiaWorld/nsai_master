### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch their selection. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and evaluate the probabilities of winning by either keeping the initial choice or switching.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code resulted in an error during evaluation:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:151.
```

**Queries and Results:**  
- The queries `prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, and `win_switch` were not executed due to the error.  
- No probability results were generated.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically at line 6:151. The issue arises because the predicate `->/2` (implication) is not correctly defined or used in the context of the ProbLog engine. The error indicates that the engine could not find clauses for the implication operator.

**Failed Predicate:**  
- `open_door/1` (lines 6-151): The predicate attempts to use an implication (`->/2`) to handle the two cases for opening a door, but the syntax or logic is incorrect.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
- The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to handle two cases:  
  1. Randomly selecting a door when two options are available.  
  2. Selecting the only available door when one option remains.  
- The error suggests that the implication operator (`->/2`) is not supported or incorrectly used in this context. ProbLog does not natively support the `->/2` operator as in Prolog; instead, probabilistic implications must be modeled differently.

**Probabilistic Rules:**  
- The code correctly defines probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) with uniform distribution.  
- The negation (`\+`) and conjunction (`member/2`) are used appropriately, but the implication logic is flawed.

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic for selecting and opening doors is conceptually correct but syntactically flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met. The probabilistic facts are correctly defined, but the implication logic fails.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-list input).  
- Recursive termination is not an issue here, but the logic for selecting doors could be more robust.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Incorrect use of `->/2` in `open_door/1` | Prevents execution of queries | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if-then-else` using `probabilistic_fact` or auxiliary predicates). |
| 2      | Missing handling of invalid inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for `open_door/1`. |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features used | N/A | Not applicable for this implementation. |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:**  
The implementation requires correction in the `open_door/1` predicate to resolve the implication issue. Once fixed, the model should correctly compute the probabilities for `win_keep` and `win_switch`.
