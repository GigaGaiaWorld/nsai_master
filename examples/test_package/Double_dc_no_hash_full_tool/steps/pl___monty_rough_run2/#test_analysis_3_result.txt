### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the chance to switch their choice. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and compute the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code results in an error during evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 11:16.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) fail due to the error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate, specifically at the line:
```prolog
0.5::open_door([A,B], A) ; 0.5::open_door([A,B], B).
```
The issue arises because the predicate `open_door/2` is not defined, but the code attempts to use it. The correct predicate should be `open_door/1` as per the requirements.

**Code Line Number Interval:**
- The error is localized to the line where `open_door/2` is incorrectly used (line 11).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `open_door/1` predicate is intended to model the host's behavior, but the implementation incorrectly uses `open_door/2`. This violates the requirements and causes the evaluation to fail.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code attempts to use probabilistic facts (`0.5::open_door([A,B], A)`) but does so incorrectly. The correct approach would involve defining `open_door/1` with probabilistic choices for the two-door case.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates, but the error prevents further evaluation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The `member/2` and `select_door/1` predicates are correctly defined.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The `prize/1` predicate is correctly defined, but the `open_door/1` predicate fails due to incorrect usage of `open_door/2`.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle the case where only one door is available (as required).
  - The code does not validate input types (e.g., non-list inputs for `member/2`).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Incorrect predicate (`open_door/2` used instead of `open_door/1`) | Evaluation fails | Replace `open_door/2` with `open_door/1` and define it as per requirements. |
| 2      | Missing case for single-door scenario in `open_door/1` | Incomplete functionality | Add a clause for the single-door case. |
| 3      | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for input types (e.g., lists for `member/2`). |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation fails due to an incorrect predicate definition (`open_door/2`). Correcting this and ensuring all edge cases are handled will resolve the issue. The probabilistic reasoning is otherwise sound, but the error prevents further evaluation. The report highlights the need for careful predicate definition and input validation in ProbLog programs.
