### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens a door that does not contain the prize and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The ProbLog implementation aims to model this scenario and compute the probabilities of winning by either keeping the initial choice or switching.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code results in an error during evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:140.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The error indicates that the ProbLog engine could not find clauses for the `->/2` operator in the `open_door/1` predicate. This suggests a syntax or logical error in the implementation of the `open_door/1` rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `open_door/1`
- **Code Location:** Line 6 (approximate interval: lines 6–140)
- **Issue:** The error arises from the use of the `->/2` operator in the `open_door/1` predicate. ProbLog does not support this operator in the same way as Prolog, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `open_door/1` predicate attempts to implement the Monty Hall host's behavior using conditional logic (`->/2`). However, ProbLog does not support Prolog's conditional operator directly.
  - The predicate should instead use probabilistic facts or annotated disjunctions to model the host's choice.

- **Probabilistic Rules:**
  - The current implementation does not correctly handle the probabilistic nature of the host's choice. The host's behavior should be modeled using probabilistic facts or annotated disjunctions, not conditional logic.

- **DeepProbLog:**
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the `open_door/1` predicate fails due to incorrect use of Prolog's `->/2` operator.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not fully met, as the host's probabilistic behavior is not correctly modeled.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The implementation does not handle cases where the host's choice is deterministic (e.g., only one door available to open).
  - The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined but not used in a way that aligns with ProbLog's syntax.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` for `->/2` | Execution failure | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible probabilistic constructs (e.g., annotated disjunctions). |
| 2   | Incorrect host behavior modeling | Incorrect probabilities | Use probabilistic facts to model the host's choice (e.g., `0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`). |
| 3   | Missing edge case handling | Potential runtime errors | Explicitly handle cases where only one door is available to open. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The current implementation fails due to the misuse of Prolog's `->/2` operator in ProbLog. To fix this, the `open_door/1` predicate should be rewritten using ProbLog's probabilistic constructs. Additionally, the host's behavior should be modeled explicitly with probabilistic facts or annotated disjunctions. No DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
