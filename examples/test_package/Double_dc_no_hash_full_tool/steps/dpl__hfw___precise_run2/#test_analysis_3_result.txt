### Evaluation Report: Analysis of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Parsing Arithmetic Expressions**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, ...]`) into their corresponding numerical results. The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `detect_all/2` to map images to symbols and then parses these symbols into arithmetic expressions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the parsing logic, test edge cases, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:
  ```
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:
  - The query represents the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`, which should evaluate to approximately `-13.6667`. The result `0.0000` is incorrect.
  - **Conclusion**: The test fails.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect result (`0.0000`).
- **Error Location**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It only handles single-number cases (`parse([N], R)`) and does not implement the required arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - **Code Line**: The issue lies in the missing rules for `parse/2` to handle operations like `[N1, +, N2 | T]`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate lacks rules for arithmetic operations. For example, it should include:
    ```prolog
    parse([N1, +, N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 + N2, parse(T, R).
    parse([N1, -, N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 - N2, parse(T, R).
    parse([N1, *, N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 * N2, parse(T, R).
    parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 / N2, parse(T, R).
    ```
  - The current implementation does not recursively parse the entire list of symbols.
- **Probabilistic Compliance**:
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog**:
  - The code does not use DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code correctly maps images to symbols but fails to parse arithmetic expressions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs or malformed expressions are not handled.
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for long expressions (not tested here).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incomplete `parse/2` predicate   | Incorrect arithmetic results    | Add rules for `parse/2` to handle arithmetic operations recursively.       |
| 2      | No error handling for edge cases | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation (e.g., check for non-list inputs or invalid symbols). |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**
The code requires significant updates to the `parse/2` predicate to correctly handle arithmetic operations. Edge cases and input validation should also be addressed to ensure robustness. The current implementation does not meet the functional requirements for parsing arithmetic expressions. No DeepProbLog features are used.
