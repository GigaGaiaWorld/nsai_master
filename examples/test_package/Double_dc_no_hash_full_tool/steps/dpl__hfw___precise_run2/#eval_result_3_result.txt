  "ErrorSummary": "The parse/2 predicate is incomplete and does not handle arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as required. The current implementation only handles single-number cases.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Add the following rules to parse/2 to handle arithmetic operations recursively:\n1. parse([N1, +, N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 + N2, parse(T, R).\n2. parse([N1, -, N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 - N2, parse(T, R).\n3. parse([N1, *, N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 * N2, parse(T, R).\n4. parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :- R is N1 / N2, parse(T, R).\nAlso, ensure the base case parse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R). is retained.",
