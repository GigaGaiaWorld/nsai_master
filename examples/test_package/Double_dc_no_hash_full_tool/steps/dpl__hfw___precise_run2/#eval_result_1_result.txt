{
  "HASH": "DA5E8955",
  "ErrorSummary": "Incorrect operator precedence handling in parse/2 predicate, leading to wrong evaluation of nested expressions like '2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7'.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Redesign parse/2 to handle operator precedence and grouping. For example, modify the predicate to use a grammar-based approach or implement a stack for correct evaluation order. Specifically, add rules for parentheses and ensure division/multiplication are evaluated before addition/subtraction.",
  "Dependencies": [],
