### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result:**  
  ```
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected:**  
  All predicates and rules function as intended. The following predicates were verified:  
  - `move/1` (lines 1–3)  
  - `beats/2` (lines 4–6)  
  - `result/3` (lines 7–12)  
  - `play/3` (lines 13–16)  
  - `compute_score/2` (lines 17–20)  
  - `determine_winner/3` (lines 21–25)  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are logically sound. Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly.  
  - **Edge Cases:** Handles draws and empty lists appropriately.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The result is deterministic.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/…` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes valid input (lists of moves). Undefined behavior for non-list inputs.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for typical game lengths but untested for very long lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem               | Impact               | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input        | Undefined behavior   | Add input validation.               |
| 2      | Deep recursion        | Potential slowdown  | Test with very long move lists.     |
| 3      | No probabilistic facts | Limited functionality| Extend for probabilistic scenarios. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation is correct and meets classical reasoning requirements. Future enhancements could include probabilistic rules or input validation.
