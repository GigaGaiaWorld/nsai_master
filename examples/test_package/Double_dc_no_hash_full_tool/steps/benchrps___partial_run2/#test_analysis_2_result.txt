### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the basic rules of the rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including gesture definitions, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the logic, test the functionality, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result matches the expected outcome (`player2` wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `move/1`: Correctly defines gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
  - `beats/2`: Correctly defines win-lose relationships.  
  - `result/3`: Correctly computes game results (`win`, `lose`, `draw`).  
  - `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Correctly handle recursive list processing and score computation.  
  - `determine_winner/3`: Correctly determines the winner based on the computed score.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The predicates are logically sound, and the recursive termination is ensured by the base case `play([], [], [])`.  
  - **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as empty lists and draws correctly.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid gestures. Non-list inputs or invalid gestures would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game scenarios.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~350 words.  

**Conclusion**: The rock-paper-scissors game logic is correctly implemented and passes all provided tests. No issues were identified in the classical reasoning or edge cases. Probabilistic and DeepProbLog features are not utilized in this implementation.
