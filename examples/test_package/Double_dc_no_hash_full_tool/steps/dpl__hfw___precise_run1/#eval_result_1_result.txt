{"HASH": "DA5E8955","ErrorSummary": "Incorrect operator precedence handling in parse/2 predicate for division, leading to wrong evaluation order","SuggestedFix": "Modify parse/2 to handle operator precedence by restructuring the parsing logic to evaluate higher precedence operations first (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction). Example fix: Add separate parse rules for grouped operations (e.g., parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :- almost_equal(R, N1 / N2), parse(T, R).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
