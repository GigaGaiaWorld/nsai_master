</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Analysis of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Parsing Arithmetic Expressions with Almost Equal Comparison**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7]`) into their corresponding numerical results. The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `detect_all/2` to map images to symbols and then parses these symbols into arithmetic expressions. The `almost_equal/2` predicate ensures numerical comparisons are tolerant to floating-point inaccuracies.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the parsing logic.
- Ensure the `almost_equal/2` predicate functions as intended.
- Confirm that the recursive parsing rules handle all arithmetic operations correctly.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
**Query Tested:**
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
```

**Verification:**
- The expected result for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` is `-13.6667`.
- The actual result is `0.0000`, which is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
- **Test Failed**: The query did not produce the expected result.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
- `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)`.

**Root Cause:**
- The `parse/2` predicate for division (`parse([N1, / | T], R)`) is correctly defined, but the overall parsing logic fails to handle operator precedence and associativity. The current implementation processes operations left-to-right without considering precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).

**Code Location:**
- The issue lies in the `parse/2` predicates (lines defining arithmetic operations) and the lack of precedence handling.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Logical Correctness:**
- The code does not account for operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation of nested expressions (e.g., `3 + 3` should be evaluated before division).
- The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly implemented but not the issue here.

**Recursive Termination:**
- The recursion in `parse/2` terminates correctly for valid inputs, but the parsing logic is flawed.

**Probabilistic Context:**
- No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this code, so probabilistic rules are not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code parses simple expressions but fails for nested or precedence-sensitive expressions.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs or invalid symbols are not handled.
- **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for small lists but untested for large inputs.
- **Operator Precedence**: Not implemented, leading to incorrect results for complex expressions.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong results for nested expressions | Implement precedence handling in `parse/2` |
| 2      | No input validation              | Crashes for invalid inputs      | Add input validation predicates            |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features          | Limited functionality           | Consider integrating neural networks if needed |

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires modifications to handle operator precedence and input validation. The current implementation is insufficient for parsing complex arithmetic expressions correctly.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
