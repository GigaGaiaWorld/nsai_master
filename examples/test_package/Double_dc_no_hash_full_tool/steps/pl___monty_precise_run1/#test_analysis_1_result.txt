### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, verifying its correctness in terms of probabilistic reasoning and logical consistency. The implementation includes probabilistic facts, rules for door selection, and queries to determine the probability of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct, as each door has an equal chance of hiding the prize.
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic (probability 1.0), which matches the code.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned the expected probabilities, and the rules for `open_door/1` and `win_keep/0`/`win_switch/0` are correctly implemented.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- The logical correctness of the rules is verified:
  - `open_door/1` correctly identifies doors that are not selected and do not hide the prize.
  - Recursive predicates (e.g., `member/2`) terminate as expected.
  
**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- The probabilities comply with the rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled in the negation checks (e.g., `\+ prize(A)`).
  - The probabilistic facts (`1/3::prize/1`) are correctly defined and distributed.

**DeepProbLog:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules for door selection and prize distribution are logically sound.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with the theoretical expectations.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- The implementation assumes valid inputs (e.g., doors are numbered 1, 2, 3). Non-list inputs or undefined predicates would cause errors but are not relevant here.
- Recursive performance is not an issue due to the small problem size.

**Code Blocks:**
```prolog
% Probabilistic facts
1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3).
select_door(1).

% Rules for opening doors
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]), member(B, [1,2,3]), A < B,
    \+ select_door(A), \+ select_door(B), \+ prize(A), \+ prize(B).

open_door(A) :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), \+ prize(A),
    \+ (member(B, [1,2,3]), B \= A, \+ select_door(B), \+ prize(B)).

% Winning conditions
win_keep :- select_door(A), prize(A).
win_switch :- member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), prize(A), \+ open_door(A).
```
