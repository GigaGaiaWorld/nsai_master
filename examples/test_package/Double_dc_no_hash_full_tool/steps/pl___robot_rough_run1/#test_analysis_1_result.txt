### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves to different locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4812 |
| `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.6300 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.3000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities derived from the probabilistic rules in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. Below is a verification of key predicates:  

- **`carrying/2`**:  
  - Defined in two clauses:  
    1. `carrying(key,s(T)) :- pickup_succeeds(T), do(pickup(key), T).` (Hash: D92532A0)  
    2. `carrying(key,s(T)) :- carrying(key, T), \+ drops(key, T).` (Hash: E4953E37)  
  - Both clauses correctly handle the probabilistic nature of picking up and retaining the key.  

- **`at/3`**:  
  - Defined for the robot and key locations, with probabilistic success/failure for movement (`goto_succeeds/1` and `goto_fails/1`).  

- **Probabilistic Facts**:  
  - All probabilistic facts (e.g., `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`) comply with the rules `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` and `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive predicates (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) terminate correctly due to the base case `slippery(key,0)` and the use of `s(T)` for time steps.  
  - Negation as failure (`\+`) is used appropriately (e.g., `\+ drops(key, T)`).  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**:  
  - The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `fumbles_key/1` are correctly defined and sum to 1.  
  - The negation rule `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is implicitly followed (e.g., `0.3::pickup_fails(T)` is the complement of `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`).  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification**: DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Fully met. The probabilities are correctly computed and combined.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input**: Not applicable (no list operations).  
- **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is manageable due to the time-step structure (`s(T)`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | No failures detected | N/A    | N/A        |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code is well-structured, logically correct, and complies with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules. No issues were identified during testing.
