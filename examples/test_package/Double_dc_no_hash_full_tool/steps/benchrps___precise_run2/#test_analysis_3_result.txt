### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including move definitions, win/lose relationships, and a scoring system. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the logic, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or predicate definition issue in the `determine_winner` rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed due to an undefined predicate or syntax error in the `determine_winner` rule.  
- **Error Location**:  
  The error points to line 41, column 77, where the `->` operator is incorrectly used or misplaced.  
- **Code Block with Issue**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
  The issue lies in the conditional logic (`->` and `;` operators).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The `determine_winner` predicate is intended to compute the winner based on the results of `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. However, the conditional logic is not correctly formatted for ProbLog.  
  - The `->` operator is not properly nested or defined, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  
- **Probabilistic Scenario**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so probabilistic reasoning compliance is not applicable here.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic for `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails due to syntax issues.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or empty lists are handled correctly by `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.  
  - The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct.  
  - The conditional logic in `determine_winner` is the primary edge case failure.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` | Prevents winner determination   | Correct the conditional logic formatting.   |
| 2   | No probabilistic facts/rules      | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic rules if needed.          |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features           | Not applicable                  | N/A                                         |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the `determine_winner` predicate with the following corrected version:  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
```

This ensures proper conditional logic and resolves the `UnknownClause` error.
