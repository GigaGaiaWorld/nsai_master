### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, test results, and potential errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails to execute due to an error related to the `member/2` predicate. The error message indicates that no clauses are found for `member/2` at line 4:1. This suggests that the predicate `member/2` is either undefined or incorrectly implemented.

**Failed Query:**
- `zebra(Houses)` fails with the error: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.`

**Expected Result:**
- The query should return a valid arrangement of houses that satisfies all the given constraints.

**Actual Result:**
- The query fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** Line 4
- **Issue:** The predicate `member/2` is not defined in the provided code. Although the code includes a custom `my_member/2` predicate, it is not used in the constraints. Instead, the code attempts to use `member/2`, which is undefined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented, but the failure occurs due to the missing `member/2` predicate.
- **Recursive Termination:** The custom `my_member/2` predicate is correctly defined and should terminate properly for list inputs.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
- **DeepProbLog:** The feature is not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents successful execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes the input is a list of houses, but there is no validation for non-list inputs.
  - The custom `my_member/2` predicate is defined but not used, which could lead to confusion.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate     | Query fails to execute           | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` or define `member/2`. |
| 2      | Unused `my_member/2` predicate   | Potential confusion              | Use `my_member/2` consistently or remove it. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The Zebra Puzzle implementation is logically sound but fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. The issue can be resolved by either defining `member/2` or replacing its usage with the custom `my_member/2` predicate. The code does not involve probabilistic reasoning or DeepProbLog features, so the focus should be on fixing the classical logic error.
