### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, verifying its correctness, logical consistency, and adherence to the specified requirements. The evaluation includes testing the solution against the provided constraints and analyzing potential failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result for the query `zebra(Houses)` is as follows:  
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```  
- **Verification**: The output satisfies all the given constraints of the puzzle.  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The implementation correctly adheres to the rules and constraints provided.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and recursively terminate. The constraints are logically sound and cover all puzzle requirements.  
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) terminate as they reduce the list size in each recursive call.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The puzzle does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are applicable.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The solution correctly deduces the house arrangement using logical constraints.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this puzzle.  
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates**: All predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are defined.  
- **Non-list Input**: The input is explicitly a list of houses, so non-list inputs are not a concern.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to the number of houses (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and adheres to all specified constraints. The solution is logically sound, and no edge cases or failures were identified. The absence of probabilistic or DeepProbLog features is noted, but these are not required for this puzzle.
