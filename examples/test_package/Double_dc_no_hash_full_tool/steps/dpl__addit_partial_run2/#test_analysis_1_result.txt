### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of `digit/2` facts representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0 to 9). It also includes a rule for `addition/3` to perform addition based on these digits. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(addition(img_5, img_6, Z)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  - The query correctly returns the sum of `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6) as 11 with a probability of 1.0000.  
  - **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  - All predicates (`digit/2` and `addition/3`) are correctly defined and function as expected.  
  - The `addition/3` rule adheres to the requirements, and the test query yields the correct result.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The `digit/2` facts are straightforward and correctly map images to digits.  
  - The `addition/3` rule is logically sound: it retrieves the digits associated with the images and computes their sum.  
  - No recursive predicates are used, so termination is not an issue.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations/implications, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  
  - The result probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The `addition/3` rule performs classical arithmetic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code does not handle cases where `digit/2` facts are missing for an image. For example, querying `addition(img_5, img_unknown, Z)` would fail.  
  - **Non-List Input**: Not applicable here, as the code does not involve list operations.  
  - **Performance**: The code is lightweight and does not involve recursion or complex computations.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `digit/2` facts   | Queries with missing images fail | Add error handling or default cases |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features     | Limited to classical reasoning  | Consider integrating neural models  |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code is functionally correct for the given requirements, but it could be enhanced to handle edge cases and integrate probabilistic or neural network features if needed.
