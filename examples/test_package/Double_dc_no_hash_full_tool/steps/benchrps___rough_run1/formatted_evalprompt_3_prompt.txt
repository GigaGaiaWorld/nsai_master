</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules and logic for a rock-paper-scissors game, including the calculation of game results and determining the winner based on a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query and its results are as follows:  
- **Query**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`  
- **Results**:  
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`  
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], draw) = 1.0000`  
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player1) = 1.0000`  

**Analysis**:  
The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all three outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. This indicates a logical error in the implementation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`  
- **Expected Result**: Only one of the outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, or `draw`) should have a probability of 1.0, depending on the actual game result.  
- **Actual Result**: All outcomes are assigned a probability of 1.0.  

**Error Location**:  
The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically in the way the score is computed and compared. The predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity of the outcomes.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The `play_round/3` and `play/3` predicates correctly implement the game rules.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score.  
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate fails to ensure that only one outcome is valid.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The results violate the probabilistic rule that the sum of probabilities for mutually exclusive outcomes must be 1.0.  
  - The issue arises because the `determine_winner/3` predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The game rules are correctly defined, but the winner determination logic is flawed.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to incorrect probability assignments.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect probability assignment | Violates probabilistic rules   | Modify `determine_winner/3` to enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes.     |
| 2      | Non-list input handling missing  | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation for list inputs.                                      |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**:  
The implementation correctly defines the game rules but fails to enforce probabilistic correctness in determining the winner. The suggested fixes include modifying the `determine_winner/3` predicate and adding input validation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
