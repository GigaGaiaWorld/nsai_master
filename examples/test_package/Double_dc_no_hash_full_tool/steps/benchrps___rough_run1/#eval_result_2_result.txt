  "ErrorSummary": "The `determine_winner` predicate allows multiple outcomes to be true simultaneously, violating probabilistic rules. The probabilities for outcomes sum to 3.0 instead of 1.0.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the `determine_winner` predicate to enforce mutual exclusivity using a single conditional structure. For example:\n\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, S),\n    (S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n    ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n    ; Winner = draw\n    ).",
