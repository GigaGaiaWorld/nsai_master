### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules and logic for a rock-paper-scissors game, including the calculation of game results and determining the winner based on a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query and its results are as follows:  
- **Query**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`  
- **Results**:  
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`  
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], draw) = 1.0000`  
  - `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player1) = 1.0000`  

**Analysis**:  
The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all three outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. This indicates a logical error in the implementation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`  
- **Expected Result**: Only one of the outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, or `draw`) should have a probability of 1.0, depending on the actual game result.  
- **Actual Result**: All outcomes are assigned a probability of 1.0.  

**Error Location**:  
The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically in the way the score is computed and compared. The predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity of the outcomes.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The `play_round/3` and `play/3` predicates correctly implement the game rules.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score.  
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate fails to ensure that only one outcome is valid.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The results violate the probabilistic rule that the sum of probabilities for mutually exclusive outcomes must be 1.0.  
  - The issue arises because the `determine_winner/3` predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The game rules are correctly defined, but the winner determination logic is flawed.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to incorrect probability assignments.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size.

|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect probability assignment | Violates probabilistic rules   | Modify `determine_winner/3` to enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes.     |
| 2      | Non-list input handling missing  | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation for list inputs.                                      |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**:  
The implementation correctly defines the game rules but fails to enforce probabilistic correctness in determining the winner. The suggested fixes include modifying the `determine_winner/3` predicate and adding input validation.
