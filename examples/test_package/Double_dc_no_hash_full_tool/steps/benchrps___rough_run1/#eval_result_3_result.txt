  "ErrorSummary": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate incorrectly assigns probabilities to all outcomes (player1, player2, draw) as 1.0, violating probabilistic rules. The logic fails to enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the `determine_winner/3` predicate to ensure only one outcome is valid. Replace the disjunctive logic (`;`) with a deterministic comparison. For example:\n```\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, S),\n    (S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n    ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n    ; Winner = draw).\n```",
