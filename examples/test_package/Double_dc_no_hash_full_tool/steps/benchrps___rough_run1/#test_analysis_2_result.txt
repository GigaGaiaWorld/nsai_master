### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code defines the rules and logic for a rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the game logic, including the win-lose relationships, round outcomes, and score computation. The evaluation also checks for adherence to classical and probabilistic reasoning rules, as well as edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```

**Test Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], draw) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player1) = 1.0000`  

**Analysis:**  
The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all three outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. This indicates a logical error in the `determine_winner` predicate.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Failed Test:** The query `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)` returns invalid probabilities.  
- **Expected Result:** Only one of the outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, or `draw`) should have a probability of 1.0, depending on the computed score.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error lies in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically in the way the score `S` is compared to determine the winner. The predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity among the outcomes, leading to multiple outcomes being assigned probability 1.0.

**Code Block with Error:**  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, S),
    ( S > 0, Winner = player1
    ; S < 0, Winner = player2
    ; S = 0, Winner = draw
    ).
```

**Issue:**  
The predicate allows all three branches to be true simultaneously if the conditions overlap, which is not possible in a deterministic game.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  The logical error arises because the `determine_winner` predicate does not ensure that only one outcome is possible. The conditions `S > 0`, `S < 0`, and `S = 0` are not mutually exclusive in the current implementation.  
  **Fix:** Use a single conditional structure (e.g., `if-then-else`) to enforce mutual exclusivity.

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
  The current implementation violates the probabilistic rule that the sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes must equal 1.0. The error occurs because the predicate does not account for the deterministic nature of the game (only one outcome is possible per round).

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The game rules are correctly defined, but the winner determination logic is flawed.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to invalid probability assignments.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct but could be optimized for large lists.  
  - **Undefined Cases:** The code assumes valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`), but invalid moves are not handled.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Invalid probability assignments | Violates probabilistic rules    | Enforce mutual exclusivity in `determine_winner` |
| 2   | Non-list input not handled      | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for lists              |
| 3   | Invalid moves not handled       | Undefined behavior              | Add validation for valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`) |

**Final Note:**  
The code requires fixes to ensure logical correctness and adherence to probabilistic rules. Edge cases should also be addressed for robustness.
