</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to define the game rules, simulate rounds between two players, and determine the winner based on the results of these rounds. The analysis focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying any errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` was executed, but it resulted in an error:  

```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 16:20.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
  - **Expected Result:** The query should return `W = player2` (since `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a score of `-1`).  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to an undefined clause for `->/2`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the `play_round` predicate, specifically at the line:  
```prolog
play_round(P1, P2, Result) :-
    (beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win;
     beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose;
     Result = draw).
```
- **Line Number Interval:** 16:20 (the line containing the `->/2` operator).  
- **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is not correctly interpreted in the ProbLog context, leading to an "UnknownClause" error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The logic of the `play_round` predicate is correct in classical Prolog, but ProbLog does not natively support the `->/2` operator in this form.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursive predicates `play/3` and `compute_score/2` are correctly defined and terminate properly.  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or implications, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/...`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is sound, but the `->/2` operator causes an error.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The `play_round` predicate fails due to the unsupported `->/2` operator.  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not tested but could cause issues if not handled.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator | Prevents execution of the query | Replace `->/2` with `if-then-else` or use ProbLog-compatible syntax. |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game is logically sound but fails due to the use of the unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog. To fix this, the `play_round` predicate should be rewritten using ProbLog-compatible syntax. The rest of the code (e.g., recursive predicates) is correctly implemented and terminates as expected. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.  

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
