### Evaluation Report: Bubble Sort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Bubble Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation through test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:
- `swap/3`: Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on their values.
- `bubble/3`: Recursively processes the list to bubble the largest element to the end.
- `bubblesort/3`: Recursively sorts the list by accumulating sorted elements.
- `forth_sort/2`: Wrapper predicate for `bubblesort/3`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The predicates `swap/3`, `bubble/3`, and `bubblesort/3` are logically correct. The recursive termination condition in `bubblesort/3` ensures the algorithm terminates when the input list is empty.
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion in `bubblesort/3` terminates because the list `L2` is progressively shortened in each recursive call until it becomes empty.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is proportional to the list length, which could be problematic for very long lists.
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion | Performance issues for large lists | Consider iterative implementation for large datasets. |
| 3      | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic sorting | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and clear.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. Edge cases and performance considerations should be addressed for robustness.
