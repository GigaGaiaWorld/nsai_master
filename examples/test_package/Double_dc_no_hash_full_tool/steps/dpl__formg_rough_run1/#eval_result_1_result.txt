{
  "HASH": "418D2062",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core merge_sort/2 logic. However, lacks input validation for non-list inputs and does not use probabilistic/DeepProbLog features.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`) at the start of merge_sort/2. 2. Consider extending with probabilistic rules if needed (e.g., probabilistic merge order).",
