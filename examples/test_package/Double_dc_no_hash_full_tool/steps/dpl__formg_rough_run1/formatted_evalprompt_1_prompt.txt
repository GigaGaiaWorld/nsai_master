</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`) for sorting lists. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog requirements. The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** The test passes, producing the correct sorted list.  

**All tests passed (no failures).**  
The test case successfully demonstrates that the `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly sorts the input list. The absence of failures indicates that the implementation adheres to the expected behavior for the given input.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verification of Expansion Predicates:**  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The `merge_sort/2` predicate is logically correct. It recursively splits the list into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together. The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) ensure termination.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates because the `split/4` predicate ensures the list is divided into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules:**  
  The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  The implementation meets the classical reasoning requirements. It correctly sorts lists using the merge sort algorithm.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  Not applicable, as the code does not involve probabilistic reasoning.  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:**  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance:**  
  The recursive splitting and merging may face performance issues for very large lists due to Prolog's stack limitations.  
- **Undefined Predicates:**  
  The `append/3` predicate is defined, but other auxiliary predicates (e.g., `length/2`) are assumed to be built-in.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used     | Limited to classical reasoning  | Consider extending for probabilistic use cases if needed. |
| 3      | Performance for large lists | Potential stack overflow       | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Addressing these limitations would enhance its versatility and reliability.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
