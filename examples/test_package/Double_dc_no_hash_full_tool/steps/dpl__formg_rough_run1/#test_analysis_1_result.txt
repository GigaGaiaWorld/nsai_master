### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`) for sorting lists. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog requirements. The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** The test passes, producing the correct sorted list.  

**All tests passed (no failures).**  
The test case successfully demonstrates that the `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly sorts the input list. The absence of failures indicates that the implementation adheres to the expected behavior for the given input.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verification of Expansion Predicates:**  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The `merge_sort/2` predicate is logically correct. It recursively splits the list into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together. The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) ensure termination.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates because the `split/4` predicate ensures the list is divided into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules:**  
  The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`). **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  The implementation meets the classical reasoning requirements. It correctly sorts lists using the merge sort algorithm.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  Not applicable, as the code does not involve probabilistic reasoning.  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:**  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance:**  
  The recursive splitting and merging may face performance issues for very large lists due to Prolog's stack limitations.  
- **Undefined Predicates:**  
  The `append/3` predicate is defined, but other auxiliary predicates (e.g., `length/2`) are assumed to be built-in.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used     | Limited to classical reasoning  | Consider extending for probabilistic use cases if needed. |
| 3      | Performance for large lists | Potential stack overflow       | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Addressing these limitations would enhance its versatility and reliability.
