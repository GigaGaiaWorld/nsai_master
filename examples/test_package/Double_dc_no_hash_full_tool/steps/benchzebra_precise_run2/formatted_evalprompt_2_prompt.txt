<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, test results, and potential errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code failed during execution with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The query `zebra(Houses)` failed because the predicate `member/2` is not defined in the provided code.  

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**  
- **Expected:** The `member/2` predicate should be defined to check if an element is a member of a list.  
- **Actual:** The predicate is missing, causing the error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`  
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at the first use of `member/2` in the `zebra/1` predicate.  
- **Root Cause:** The `member/2` predicate is not defined in the code, despite being used extensively in the constraints.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The puzzle's constraints are logically sound, but the implementation is incomplete due to the missing `member/2` predicate.  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here since the missing predicate halts execution before any recursion occurs.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code assumes the `member/2` predicate is available, which is a critical oversight.  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates would cause runtime errors.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate | Execution fails immediately     | Define `member/2` or import it from a library. |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features      | Limited to classical reasoning  | N/A (if not required).              |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Add the following definition for `member/2` to the code:  
```prolog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
```

This will resolve the error and allow the puzzle constraints to be evaluated correctly.

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  

**Conclusion:** The implementation is logically sound but incomplete due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Once this is fixed, the puzzle should execute as expected.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
