### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, test results, and potential issues.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails to execute due to an error related to the `member/2` predicate. The error message indicates that no clauses are found for `member/2` at line 4.  

**Failed Query:**  
- `zebra(Houses)`  
  - **Error:** `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.`  

**Expected Behavior:**  
The query should return a valid arrangement of houses that satisfies all the given constraints.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`  
  - **Location:** Line 4 of the code.  
  - **Issue:** The predicate `member/2` is not defined in the provided code, despite being used extensively in the constraints.  

**Code Block with Issue:**  
```prolog
member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
member(house(spanish, _, dog, _, _), Houses),
...
```

**Root Cause:**  
The `member/2` predicate is a built-in predicate in Prolog, but it is not recognized in ProbLog unless explicitly defined or imported. The code attempts to use `member/2` without providing its definition.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The logic of the puzzle constraints is correct, but the implementation fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) are correctly defined and should terminate properly.  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  

**Missing Definitions:**  
- The `member/2` predicate must be defined or imported.  
- The `houses/1` predicate is defined but not used correctly in the context of the puzzle.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (fails due to missing `member/2`).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not used.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined predicates (`member/2`).  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (though the puzzle assumes a list of houses).  
  - Recursive performance is not an issue here.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate     | Code fails to execute          | Define or import `member/2`        |
| 2      | Unused `houses/1` predicate      | Potential confusion            | Ensure `houses/1` is correctly used |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The Zebra Puzzle implementation in ProbLog fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Once this issue is resolved, the code should correctly solve the puzzle. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
