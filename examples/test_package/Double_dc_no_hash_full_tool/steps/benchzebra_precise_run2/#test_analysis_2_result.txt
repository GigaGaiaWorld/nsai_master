### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, test results, and potential errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code failed during execution with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The query `zebra(Houses)` failed because the predicate `member/2` is not defined in the provided code.  

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**  
- **Expected:** The `member/2` predicate should be defined to check if an element is a member of a list.  
- **Actual:** The predicate is missing, causing the error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`  
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at the first use of `member/2` in the `zebra/1` predicate.  
- **Root Cause:** The `member/2` predicate is not defined in the code, despite being used extensively in the constraints.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The puzzle's constraints are logically sound, but the implementation is incomplete due to the missing `member/2` predicate.  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here since the missing predicate halts execution before any recursion occurs.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code assumes the `member/2` predicate is available, which is a critical oversight.  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates would cause runtime errors.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate | Execution fails immediately     | Define `member/2` or import it from a library. |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features      | Limited to classical reasoning  | N/A (if not required).              |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Add the following definition for `member/2` to the code:  
```prolog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
```

This will resolve the error and allow the puzzle constraints to be evaluated correctly.

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  

**Conclusion:** The implementation is logically sound but incomplete due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Once this is fixed, the puzzle should execute as expected.
