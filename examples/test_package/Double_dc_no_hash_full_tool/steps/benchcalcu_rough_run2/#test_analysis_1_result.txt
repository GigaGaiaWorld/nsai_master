#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digit assignments for the equation `AB + BCD = CDE`. The code uses predicates to enforce constraints such as unique digits, non-zero leading digits, and column-wise addition with carry propagation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the solution, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`, each with a probability of `1.0000`. Below are the results:  

```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the constraints defined in the code, and each solution satisfies the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` with unique digit assignments.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- `leftdigit/1` ensures non-zero leading digits.  
- `all_different/1` enforces unique digit assignments.  
- `sumdigit/5` correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry propagation.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `sumdigit/5` correctly handles carry propagation, and `all_different/1` ensures no digit repetitions.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates because the list shrinks with each recursive call.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The results are deterministic (probability `1.0000`), indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved.  
- No negations or implications are used, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are irrelevant here.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle using deterministic constraints.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (0–9) and does not handle non-list inputs.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the list length (5 digits), so performance is not an issue.
