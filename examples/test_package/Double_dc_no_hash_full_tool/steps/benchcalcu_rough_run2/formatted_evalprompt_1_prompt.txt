</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Analysis Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digit assignments for the equation `AB + BCD = CDE`. The code uses predicates to enforce constraints such as unique digits, non-zero leading digits, and column-wise addition with carry propagation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the solution, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`, each with a probability of `1.0000`. Below are the results:  

```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the constraints defined in the code, and each solution satisfies the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` with unique digit assignments.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- `leftdigit/1` ensures non-zero leading digits.  
- `all_different/1` enforces unique digit assignments.  
- `sumdigit/5` correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry propagation.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `sumdigit/5` correctly handles carry propagation, and `all_different/1` ensures no digit repetitions.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates because the list shrinks with each recursive call.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The results are deterministic (probability `1.0000`), indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved.  
- No negations or implications are used, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are irrelevant here.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle using deterministic constraints.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (0–9) and does not handle non-list inputs.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the list length (5 digits), so performance is not an issue.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified.

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
