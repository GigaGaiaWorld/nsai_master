{"HASH": "501F546D", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the classical Prolog implementation of insertion sort. However, lacks probabilistic or neural network features for hybrid reasoning.", "SuggestedFix": "None needed for classical Prolog functionality. To extend for ProbLog, consider adding probabilistic rules or neural network integration (e.g., `nn/3`) if required.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
