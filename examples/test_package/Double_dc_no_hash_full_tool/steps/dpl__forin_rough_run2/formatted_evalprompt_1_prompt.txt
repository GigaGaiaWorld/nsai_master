.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the `insertion_sort/2` Prolog Program**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog program implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) to sort a list of integers. The program consists of three main predicates:  
1. `insertion_sort/2`: The entry point for sorting.  
2. `insertion_sort/3`: A helper predicate for recursive sorting.  
3. `insert/3`: Inserts an element into the correct position in a sorted list.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test was executed:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The program correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**  
1. **Logical Correctness:**  
   - The program adheres to the insertion sort logic:  
     - The base case (`insertion_sort([], Sorted, Sorted)`) terminates recursion.  
     - The recursive case (`insertion_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted)`) inserts the head `H` into the accumulator `Acc` and continues sorting the tail `T`.  
   - The `insert/3` predicate correctly places elements in the sorted list.  

2. **Recursive Termination:**  
   - The recursion terminates because the list is progressively reduced (`[H|T]` becomes `T`), eventually reaching the base case.  

##### **ProbLog Analysis**  
- The program does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) or probabilistic reasoning extensions are present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | The program correctly implements insertion sort in classical Prolog.        |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Met  | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Met | No DeepProbLog features are utilized.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
1. **Non-list Input:**  
   - The program assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) will cause errors.  
2. **Empty List:**  
   - Handled correctly by the base case.  
3. **Performance:**  
   - The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic logic  | Extend with ProbLog rules if needed.        |
| 2   | No DeepProbLog features  | No neural integration           | Consider adding `nn/3` for hybrid reasoning.|
| 3   | Non-list input handling  | Program may crash               | Add input validation.                       |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` program is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks probabilistic and neural network features, limiting its applicability in hybrid reasoning scenarios. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
