### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the `insertion_sort/2` Prolog Program**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog program implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) to sort a list of integers. The program consists of three main predicates:  
1. `insertion_sort/2`: The entry point for sorting.  
2. `insertion_sort/3`: A helper predicate for recursive sorting.  
3. `insert/3`: Inserts an element into the correct position in a sorted list.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test was executed:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The program correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**  
1. **Logical Correctness:**  
   - The program adheres to the insertion sort logic:  
     - The base case (`insertion_sort([], Sorted, Sorted)`) terminates recursion.  
     - The recursive case (`insertion_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted)`) inserts the head `H` into the accumulator `Acc` and continues sorting the tail `T`.  
   - The `insert/3` predicate correctly places elements in the sorted list.  

2. **Recursive Termination:**  
   - The recursion terminates because the list is progressively reduced (`[H|T]` becomes `T`), eventually reaching the base case.  

##### **ProbLog Analysis**  
- The program does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) or probabilistic reasoning extensions are present.

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | The program correctly implements insertion sort in classical Prolog.        |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Met  | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Met | No DeepProbLog features are utilized.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
1. **Non-list Input:**  
   - The program assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) will cause errors.  
2. **Empty List:**  
   - Handled correctly by the base case.  
3. **Performance:**  
   - The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic logic  | Extend with ProbLog rules if needed.        |
| 2   | No DeepProbLog features  | No neural integration           | Consider adding `nn/3` for hybrid reasoning.|
| 3   | Non-list input handling  | Program may crash               | Add input validation.                       |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` program is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks probabilistic and neural network features, limiting its applicability in hybrid reasoning scenarios. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
