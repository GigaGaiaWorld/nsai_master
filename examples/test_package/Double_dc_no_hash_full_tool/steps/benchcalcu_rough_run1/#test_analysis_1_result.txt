#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digits for variables `A, B, C, D, E` such that the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` holds. The solution involves constraints like unique digits, no leading zeros, and column-wise addition with carry propagation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`, each with a probability of `1.0000`. Here are the results:  

| Query                  | Probability |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `[4, 7, 8, 2, 9]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[4, 7, 8, 3, 0]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[5, 6, 7, 2, 8]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[5, 7, 8, 4, 1]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[6, 7, 8, 5, 2]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[7, 4, 5, 2, 6]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[7, 5, 6, 3, 8]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[8, 3, 4, 2, 5]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[8, 4, 5, 3, 7]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[8, 5, 6, 4, 9]`      | 1.0000      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each solution satisfies the constraints of the puzzle, and the probabilities are correctly computed as `1.0000` (deterministic solutions).

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures no leading zeros (lines 1–2).  
- `all_different/1`: Enforces unique digits (lines 3–6).  
- `sumdigit/5`: Simulates column-wise addition with carry (lines 7–10).  
- `query_sum/1`: Combines constraints to solve the puzzle (lines 11–14).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `sumdigit/5` correctly handles carry propagation, and `all_different/1` ensures digit uniqueness.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates because the list shrinks with each recursive call.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic computations (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are involved.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/…` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic constraints.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (0–9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the list length (5 digits), so performance is not an issue.

| Number | Problem               | Impact | Suggestion                     |
|--------|-----------------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| 1      | None                  | None   | None (all tests passed)        |
