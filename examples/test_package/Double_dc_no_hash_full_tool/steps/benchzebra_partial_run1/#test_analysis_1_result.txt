### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of given clues. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle. The evaluation focuses on verifying the logical constraints, testing the results, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test result for the query `zebra(Houses)` is as follows:  
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
      house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
      house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
      house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
      house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

- **Verification**:  
  - The result satisfies all the given constraints (e.g., the owner of the red house is English, the Spanish has a dog, the middle house drinks milk, etc.).  
  - The probability of the solution is `1.0000`, indicating certainty in the classical logic context.  

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The implementation correctly adheres to the logical constraints and produces the expected output.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are correctly defined and recursively terminate.  
  - The constraints are implemented as expected, and the solution satisfies all of them.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursive predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) are well-defined and terminate for valid inputs.  

##### **Probabilistic ProbLog Analysis**  
- The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules. It is purely deterministic, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are applicable.  

##### **DeepProbLog Analysis**  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  - The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
1. **Classical Reasoning**:  
   - Fully met. The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle using classical logic constraints.  

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
   - Not applicable, as the problem is deterministic.  

3. **Neural Network Integration**:  
   - Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases and Robustness**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input**: The predicates assume list inputs, but no checks are in place for invalid inputs (e.g., non-list).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.  

##### **Suggestions for Improvement**  
- Add input validation for the `Houses` list to ensure it is a list of length 5.  
- If probabilistic reasoning is desired, introduce probabilistic facts or rules to model uncertainty.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The implementation is correct and robust for the given problem. No errors were found.
