### Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Stack Operations Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implemented stack operations.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Identify any edge cases or potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1),[2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [1,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,1,2,3,4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot,[1,2,3,4],Y)` | `Y = [2,3,1,4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected behavior for each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates and rules function as intended. The following predicates were verified:
- `stack_op/3` for each operation (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`).
- No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) were used or required.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The logical correctness of the stack operations is confirmed. Each operation adheres to the expected behavior (e.g., `push` adds an element, `pop` removes the top element).
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here, as the operations are non-recursive.

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations. All operations are deterministic (probability = 1.0000).
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) were used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations are correctly implemented and tested.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` require a minimum number of elements. Edge cases with insufficient elements are not tested.
  - **Performance:** No deep recursion is involved, so performance is not a concern.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input for stack | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | Insufficient elements for operations (e.g., `pop` on empty stack) | Undefined behavior | Test edge cases and handle errors gracefully. |

**Word Count:** 350 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The implementation is correct for the tested cases. However, additional edge case testing and input validation would improve robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features were utilized.
