### Merge Sort in ProbLog: Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to the specified requirements, and ensure it handles edge cases and probabilistic scenarios appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query and its result are as follows:  
- **Query:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
- **Result:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
- The test passes, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the specified requirements:  
1. **Length Calculation and Boundary Check:**  
   - The `length(List, Len)` and `Len > 1` checks ensure recursive splitting only occurs for lists longer than one element.  
2. **Recursive Sorting:**  
   - The `merge_sort` predicate correctly splits the list into `Left` and `Right` halves and recursively sorts them.  
3. **Merging:**  
   - The `merge` predicate combines the sorted sublists into the final result.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
  - The implementation is logically correct. The recursive calls terminate when the list length is â‰¤ 1, ensuring no infinite recursion.  
  - The `split_list` predicate divides the list into two equal (or nearly equal) parts, and the `merge` predicate correctly combines them in sorted order.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case, as the implementation is deterministic.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Empty List:** Handled by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.  
  - **Single-Element List:** Handled by the base case `merge_sort([X], [X])`.  
  - **Non-List Input:** Not explicitly handled, but ProbLog will fail gracefully if the input is not a list.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance depends on the list length, but the divide-and-conquer approach ensures logarithmic recursion depth.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is correct and adheres to the specified requirements. No failures were detected in the provided test case. The code handles edge cases such as empty and single-element lists but does not explicitly validate non-list inputs. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
