### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle that involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle. The evaluation focuses on:
- Verification of test results.
- Logical correctness and termination of recursive predicates.
- Compliance with probabilistic rules (if applicable).
- Edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test result for the query `zebra(Houses)` is:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**: The output matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, and the probability of the result is 1.0000, indicating certainty.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**: All predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and satisfy the puzzle constraints.
- **Expansion predicates**: Not applicable in this context, as the puzzle is purely classical and does not involve probabilistic or DeepProbLog features.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:
  - **Logical Correctness**: The predicates `my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3` are logically sound and correctly implement the puzzle constraints.
  - **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly because they reduce the problem size with each recursive call (e.g., by processing the tail of the list).
- **Probabilistic Scenario**:
  - Not applicable, as the puzzle does not involve probabilistic facts or rules.
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are present in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic programming.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not required.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not required.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable.
  - **Non-list Input**: The `houses/1` predicate ensures the input is a list of five houses, preventing non-list inputs.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to the length of the list (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and robust. All test cases pass, and the predicates are logically sound and efficiently defined. The solution adheres to classical logic programming principles without requiring probabilistic or neural network extensions. No edge cases or failures were identified.
