### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic facts and rules to simulate the robot's actions, such as picking up the key, dropping it, and moving to new locations. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure that all functional requirements are met.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5898`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities derived from the probabilistic facts and rules in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned probabilities consistent with the defined rules and probabilistic facts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Logical Correctness:**  
- The predicates `carrying(key,s(T))` and `at(robot,Pos,s(T))` are correctly defined to handle both success and failure cases (e.g., `pickup_succeeds(T)` vs. `pickup_fails(T)`).  
- Recursive termination is ensured by the base case for `slippery(key,0)` and the use of `s(T)` for time steps.

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
- The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds(T)`, `drop_slippery_key(T)`, and `goto_succeeds(T)` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`).  
- The negation `\+ drops(key, T)` is correctly handled in the probabilistic context.

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **DeepProbLog feature not used.** The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/…`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key pickup/drop scenarios.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and aligned with the defined rules.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases such as the robot failing to move (`goto_fails(T)`) or the key being slippery (`slippery(key,T)`).  
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present in the code.  
- Recursive performance is efficient due to the limited depth of recursion (time steps `s(T)`).
