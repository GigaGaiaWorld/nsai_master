#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Code in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digits for the variables `A, B, C, D, E` such that the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` holds. The code enforces constraints like non-zero leading digits, uniqueness of digits, and correct column-wise addition with carry propagation. The purpose of this analysis is to verify the correctness of the implementation, evaluate test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided include 10 successful queries, each returning a probability of `1.0000`. Here are the results:
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly enforces the constraints and solves the cryptoaddition puzzle for the given inputs.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the constraints (non-zero leading digits, uniqueness, and column-wise addition) are satisfied.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The logical correctness of the code is verified. The recursive predicate `all_different/1` ensures uniqueness of digits, and the `sumdigit/5` predicate correctly handles carry propagation.
  - Recursive termination is guaranteed because `all_different/1` reduces the list size in each recursive call, and `sumdigit/5` has no recursion.

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle using deterministic constraints.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The `all_different/1` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures this by construction.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue here due to small input size (5 digits).
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`leftdigit/1`, `sumdigit/5`, `all_different/1`) are defined.
