### Aircraft Flap Controller Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:  

| Query                | Probability |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low but non-zero.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- `flap_position/2` correctly updates the flap position if it is legal.  
- `overrun_exception/1` triggers when an illegal position is attempted.  
- `goal_reached/1` checks if the current position matches the goal.  

The expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are not used in this code, so no verification is required for them.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for updating the flap position (`attempted_flap_position/2`) and checking for exceptions (`overrun_exception/1`) are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as the time steps are bounded by `at(5)`.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities of `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with the rules of probability theory (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled in the probabilistic context.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The system correctly updates the flap position and checks for exceptions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities are computed correctly, and the results reflect the probabilistic nature of the system.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The system handles edge cases such as illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception/1`) and ensures termination (`at(5)`).  
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
