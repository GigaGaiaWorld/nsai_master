### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, where each coin has a probability of 0.8 to land heads. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) in a sequence of 4 tosses (`CNT`). The results are accumulated in `S`, and the probabilities for each possible outcome (`total(S)`) are computed. This report evaluates the correctness of the implementation, verifies the test results, and ensures compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the query `total(_)` are as follows:  
- `total(4) = 0.4096`  
- `total(3) = 0.4096`  
- `total(2) = 0.1536`  
- `total(1) = 0.0256`  
- `total(0) = 0.0016`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities sum to 1 (`0.4096 + 0.4096 + 0.1536 + 0.0256 + 0.0016 = 1.0`), which is correct.  
- The probabilities align with the binomial distribution for 4 trials with success probability 0.8.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The code correctly implements the requirements:  
- The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` terminates when `CNT` reaches 0.  
- The success count `SC` increments only when `coin(CNT)` is true (probability 0.8).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursion in `coins_r/3` correctly decrements `CNT` and updates `SC` based on the outcome of `coin(CNT)`.  
- **Termination:** The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` ensures termination.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probability of `coin(CNT)` being true is 0.8, and its negation (`\+ coin(CNT)`) is implicitly `1 - 0.8 = 0.2`.  
- The results comply with the binomial distribution formula:  
  - `P(k successes) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)`  
  - For example, `total(2) = C(4,2) * 0.8^2 * 0.2^2 = 6 * 0.64 * 0.04 = 0.1536`.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The recursion and counting logic are correct.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed accurately.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** None.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is fixed (`CNT=4`), so performance is not an issue.
