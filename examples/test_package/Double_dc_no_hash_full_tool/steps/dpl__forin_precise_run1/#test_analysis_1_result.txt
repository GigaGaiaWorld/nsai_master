### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Insertion Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```problog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```problog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The result matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` function as intended.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Recursively sorts the tail list and inserts the head element.  
- `insert_element/3`: Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

**Line Number Intervals:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Lines 1–3 (base case and recursive case).  
- `insert_element/3`: Lines 4–8 (base case and recursive insertion rules).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation adheres to the insertion sort algorithm. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The test case is deterministic (probability 1.0000), so no probabilistic facts or negations are involved.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used in this code.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this deterministic test case.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very long lists, but this is not tested here.

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow        | Optimize for tail recursion.        |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Notes:**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. Edge cases and performance optimizations could be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features were utilized.
