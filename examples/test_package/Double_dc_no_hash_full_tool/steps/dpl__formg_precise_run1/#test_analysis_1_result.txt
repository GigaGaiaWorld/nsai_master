### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The implementation includes recursive splitting of lists, merging sorted sublists, and handling edge cases. The evaluation focuses on:  
- Logical correctness and termination of recursion.  
- Compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules (if applicable).  
- Edge case handling (e.g., empty lists, single-element lists).  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query and Result:**  
- `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)` returns `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  

**Verification:**  
- The test result matches the expected output.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- All predicates (`merge_sort/2`, `split_list/3`, `merge/3`, `append/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination for empty and single-element lists.  
  - The recursive splitting (`split_list/3`) and merging (`merge/3`) are correctly implemented.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the list is split into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`).  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - Not used in this implementation (no `nn/3` or `tensor/…` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:**  
   - Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts lists using classical Prolog recursion and merging.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
   - Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration:**  
   - Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Empty List:** Handled by `merge_sort([], [])`.  
- **Single-Element List:** Handled by `merge_sort([X], [X])`.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not explicitly handled (e.g., `merge_sort(123, X)` would fail).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion could be inefficient for very large lists, but this is inherent to the algorithm.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error for invalid inputs | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` check). |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Potential stack overflow | Consider iterative implementations for very large lists. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it could be improved by handling non-list inputs and optimizing for very large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
