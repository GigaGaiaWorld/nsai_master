### Evaluation Report: Bubble Sort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubble Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully, producing the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules are correctly defined and function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3` predicates correctly implement the bubble sort algorithm. The recursive termination condition (`bubblesort([], L, L)`) ensures the algorithm terminates when the input list is empty.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `bubblesort/3` reduces the problem size by removing the largest element (`X`) in each iteration, ensuring termination.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations/implications, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are applicable here.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  The implementation meets the requirements for classical reasoning, correctly sorting the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**:  
  The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  No undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are used in the code.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation checks.        |
| 2      | Performance for large n  | Inefficient for large lists     | Consider optimizing or using a more efficient algorithm. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The bubble sort implementation in ProbLog is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may suffer from performance issues for large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized in this implementation.
