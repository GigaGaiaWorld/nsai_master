 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Bubble Sort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubble Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully, producing the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules are correctly defined and function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3` predicates correctly implement the bubble sort algorithm. The recursive termination condition (`bubblesort([], L, L)`) ensures the algorithm terminates when the input list is empty.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `bubblesort/3` reduces the problem size by removing the largest element (`X`) in each iteration, ensuring termination.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations/implications, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are applicable here.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **DeepProbLog feature not used**.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  The implementation meets the requirements for classical reasoning, correctly sorting the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**:  
  The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  No undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are used in the code.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation checks.        |
| 2      | Performance for large n  | Inefficient for large lists     | Consider optimizing or using a more efficient algorithm. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The bubble sort implementation in ProbLog is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may suffer from performance issues for large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized in this implementation.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
