### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, where each coin has a probability of 0.8 to land heads. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) in a sequence of tosses (`CNT`) and accumulate the results (`S`). The test results show the probabilities of achieving different counts of heads (`total(S)`). This report evaluates the correctness of the code, verifies the test results, and ensures compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:
- `total(4) = 0.4096`
- `total(3) = 0.4096`
- `total(2) = 0.1536`
- `total(1) = 0.0256`
- `total(0) = 0.0016`

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities are consistent with the binomial distribution for 4 trials with success probability 0.8.  
- For example, `total(4)` corresponds to all 4 coins landing heads: \(0.8^4 = 0.4096\).  
- Similarly, `total(0)` corresponds to all 4 coins landing tails: \(0.2^4 = 0.0016\).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:
- The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` terminates when `CNT` reaches 0.  
- The probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is correctly defined with a probability of 0.8.  
- The accumulation of successes (`SC`) and the final result (`S`) are computed as required.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursion in `coins_r/3` correctly decrements `CNT` and updates `SC` based on the outcome of `coin(CNT)`.  
- **Termination:** The recursion terminates when `CNT = 0`, ensuring no infinite loops.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probability of `coin(C)` being true is 0.8, and its negation (`\+ coin(C)`) is implicitly \(1 - 0.8 = 0.2\).  
- The results comply with the binomial distribution, confirming correct probabilistic reasoning.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The recursion and counting logic are correct.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this code.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (`CNT` starts at 4), so performance is not an issue.  

**Suggestions:**  
- If the number of tosses (`CNT`) becomes large, consider optimizing the recursion or using dynamic programming to avoid stack overflow.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None        |

**Conclusion:** The code is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors were found.
