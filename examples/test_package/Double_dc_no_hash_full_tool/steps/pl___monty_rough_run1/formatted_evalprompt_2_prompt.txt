<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch their selection. The goal of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the ProbLog implementation of this problem, focusing on:
- The definition of probabilistic facts (`prize/1`).
- The logic for selecting and opening doors (`select_door/1`, `open_door/1`).
- The queries for winning strategies (`win_keep`, `win_switch`).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails during execution due to the absence of the `open_door/1` predicate, which is required for the `win_switch` query. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'open_door/1' at 14:5.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- `win_switch`: Fails because `open_door/1` is undefined.

**Passed Queries:**
- `prize(_)`: Correctly defines the probabilistic distribution of the prize.
- `select_door(_)`: Correctly initializes the player's door selection.
- `win_keep`: Correctly checks if the player wins by keeping their initial choice.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `open_door/1`
  - **Location:** Line 14 (referenced in the error message).
  - **Issue:** The predicate is not defined, violating the requirements for Monty's door-opening behavior.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic for `win_switch` depends on `open_door/1`, which is missing. This breaks the probabilistic reasoning chain.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The current implementation correctly defines `prize/1` with uniform probabilities (`1/3`). However, the negation in `win_switch` (`\+ open_door(A)`) cannot be evaluated without `open_door/1`.
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `select_door/1` and `prize/1` predicates are correctly defined.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met. The `prize/1` distribution is correct, but the missing `open_door/1` prevents full probabilistic reasoning.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list membership.
  - The `random_member/2` predicate is incomplete and unused in the current code.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `open_door/1` not defined   | `win_switch` query fails        | Define `open_door/1` as per the requirements (uniform random or deterministic). |
| 2   | `random_member/2` incomplete | Unused in current implementation | Remove or complete the predicate if needed for future extensions.          |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
To resolve the error, define `open_door/1` as follows:
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    prize(Prize),
    findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ D = Selected, \+ D = Prize), Doors),
    random_member(Door, Doors).
```

This ensures Monty opens a door uniformly at random from the available non-selected, non-prize doors.

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
