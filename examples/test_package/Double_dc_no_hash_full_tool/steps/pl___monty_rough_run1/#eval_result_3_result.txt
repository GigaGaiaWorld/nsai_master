{
  "HASH": "751033ED",
  "ErrorSummary": "The 'open_door/1' predicate uses non-standard ProbLog predicates ('findall/3', 'random_member/2') and lacks proper implementation for Monty Hall's door-opening logic.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace 'findall/3' and 'random_member/2' with ProbLog-compatible predicates. Rewrite 'open_door/1' to explicitly handle the two cases: (1) randomly selecting between two valid doors, and (2) opening the only valid door. Use probabilistic facts for randomness if needed.",

  "NeedRegenerate": true
