### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch their selection. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and evaluate the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails during execution with the error:  
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:14.
```  
This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code, preventing the queries from being evaluated. No probability results are returned due to the failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs at line 10, column 14, where the `->/2` operator is used in the `open_door/1` predicate.  
- **Root Cause**: The `->/2` operator is not correctly implemented or is missing required clauses. The error suggests that the conditional logic in `open_door/1` is malformed.  
- **Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  open_door(Door) :-
      select_door(Selected),
      findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), Doors),
      length(Doors, N),
      (N =:= 2 ->
          random_member(Door, Doors)
      ; N =:= 1 ->
          member(Door, Doors)
      ).
  ```  
  The issue lies in the conditional branching (`->/2`), which is not properly defined or supported in the current context.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate attempts to implement the Monty Hall host's behavior but fails due to incorrect use of the `->/2` operator.  
  - The `findall/3` call is also problematic because it includes a negated condition (`\+ prize(D)`) without proper handling of probabilistic facts.  

- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The code does not correctly compute probabilities for negated events (`\+ prize(D)`). In ProbLog, negation requires careful handling to ensure probabilistic consistency.  
  - The `random_member/2` predicate is not a built-in ProbLog predicate, which may cause further issues.  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met, but the `open_door/1` predicate is flawed.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not fully met due to incorrect handling of negation and conditional logic.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where all doors are invalid (e.g., if the player selects the only door without a prize).  
  - The `member/2` predicate is recursive but may not terminate for non-list inputs.

|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Malformed `->/2` operator       | Prevents execution of queries   | Replace with `if-then-else` or ensure proper clause definitions.           |
| 2   | Incorrect `findall/3` usage     | Misidentifies valid doors      | Correct the negated condition and ensure probabilistic consistency.        |
| 3   | Missing `random_member/2`       | Unsupported predicate           | Implement a custom random selection or use a supported ProbLog predicate. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code fails due to logical and syntactic errors in the `open_door/1` predicate. Addressing these issues is critical for correct probabilistic reasoning in the Monty Hall problem.
