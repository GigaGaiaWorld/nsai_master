  "HASH": "751033ED",
  "ErrorSummary": "The predicate 'open_door/1' is missing, which is required for the 'win_switch' query to function correctly. The current implementation fails because it cannot evaluate the negation of 'open_door(A)' without the predicate being defined.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Define 'open_door/1' as follows to meet the requirements:\n1. If there are two doors A and B, neither of which has a prize, and neither of which is the door chosen by the player, then Monty will open a door uniformly at random between A and B.\n2. If there is only one door A that has no prize and is not the door chosen by the player, then Monty must open it.\n\nExample implementation:\nopen_door(Door) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    prize(Prize),\n    findall(D, (member(D, [1,2,3]), \\+ D = Selected, \\+ D = Prize), Doors),\n    random_member(Door, Doors).",
