### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation aims to model the problem and evaluate the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails during evaluation with the error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:171.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) fail due to the unresolved error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs at line 6, column 171, indicating a missing or malformed clause. The problematic section is the `open_door/1` predicate, which is not correctly defined. Specifically:  
- The `findall/3` and `random_member/2` predicates are not standard in ProbLog, leading to the `UnknownClause` error.  
- The `member/2` predicate is defined recursively but not used correctly in the `open_door/1` clause.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The `open_door/1` predicate violates ProbLog syntax by using non-standard predicates (`findall/3`, `random_member/2`).  
- The recursive `member/2` predicate is correct but unused in the intended context.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined with uniform probabilities.  
- The negation in `win_switch` (`\+ open_door(A)`) is syntactically correct but fails due to the `open_door/1` error.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) is used.  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive `member/2` works, but `open_door/1` fails).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Partially met (probabilistic facts are correct, but queries fail).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Non-list inputs to `member/2` are not handled.  
- The `open_door/1` predicate lacks robustness for edge cases (e.g., no valid doors to open).

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `findall/3` in ProbLog   | `open_door/1` fails             | Replace with ProbLog-compatible predicates |
| 2   | Undefined `random_member/2`      | Random door selection fails     | Use `probabilistic` facts for randomness   |
| 3   | Incorrect `open_door/1` logic    | Host behavior not modeled       | Rewrite to comply with ProbLog syntax      |
| 4   | Unused `member/2`                | No impact on failure            | Ensure predicates are utilized correctly   |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation fails due to syntax errors in the `open_door/1` predicate. Correcting these issues and adhering to ProbLog's standard predicates will resolve the failures. The probabilistic setup is sound, but the classical reasoning component requires revision.
