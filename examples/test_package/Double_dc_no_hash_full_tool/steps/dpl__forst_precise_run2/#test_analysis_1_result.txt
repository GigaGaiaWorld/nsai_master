#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog: Test Results and Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code defines a set of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations against the given test cases, analyze any failures, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules. The report also checks for edge cases and the integration of DeepProbLog features.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [3, 1, 2, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the stack operations.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

- **Code Blocks Verified:**  
  - `stack_op(push(X), Stack, [X|Stack])` (Line 1)  
  - `stack_op(pop, [_|Stack], Stack)` (Line 2)  
  - `stack_op(dup, [X|Stack], [X,X|Stack])` (Line 3)  
  - `stack_op(swap, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X|Stack])` (Line 4)  
  - `stack_op(over, [X,Y|Stack], [Y,X,Y|Stack])` (Line 5)  
  - `stack_op(rot, [X,Y,Z|Stack], [Z,X,Y|Stack])` (Line 6)  
  - `stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)` (Lines 7–9)

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** All predicates are logically sound. For example, `push` correctly prepends an element to the stack, and `pop` removes the top element.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used in the provided predicates, so termination is not an issue.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The test results show probabilities of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or negations are used in the provided code.  
- **Compliance with Probabilistic Rules:** Not applicable here, as the code does not involve probabilistic facts or implications.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Conclusion:** DeepProbLog feature not used.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All stack operations behave as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers) would cause failures.  
- **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` require at least one element in the stack. The code does not handle empty stacks gracefully.  
- **Performance:** No deep recursion is used, so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime failure | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Empty stack not handled | Runtime failure | Add checks for empty stacks. |

**Final Note:** The code is functionally correct for the tested cases but lacks robustness for edge cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
