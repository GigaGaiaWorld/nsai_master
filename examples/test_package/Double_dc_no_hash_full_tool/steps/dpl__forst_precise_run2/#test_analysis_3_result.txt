### Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog: Functional and Probabilistic Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code defines a set of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the stack operations through test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements, including edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [3, 1, 2, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. The `sort` operation, which was not explicitly tested in the provided queries, should be verified separately for edge cases (e.g., stacks with fewer than 3 elements).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The logical correctness of the stack operations is confirmed. For example, `push` correctly prepends an element, and `pop` removes the top element.
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here, as the operations are non-recursive.
  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or negations. All operations are deterministic, as evidenced by the probability results (1.0000).
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations behave as expected.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as the operations are deterministic.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `sort` operation should handle stacks with fewer than 3 elements gracefully (as implemented in the second clause of `stack_op(sort, Stack, Stack)`).
  - Non-list inputs or malformed stacks are not explicitly handled, which could lead to runtime errors.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Untested `sort` operation for small stacks | Potential undetected bugs | Add test cases for stacks with <3 elements |
| 2 | No input validation for non-list inputs | Runtime errors | Add guards to ensure input is a list |
| 3 | No probabilistic features used | Limited scope | Consider extending with probabilistic facts if needed |
