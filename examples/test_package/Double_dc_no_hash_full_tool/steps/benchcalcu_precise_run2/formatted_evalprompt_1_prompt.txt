<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Analysis Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The puzzle enforces the following constraints:  
- Each letter represents a unique digit (0–9).  
- The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
- The solution must account for carry-over during addition.  

The purpose of this report is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`. All solutions returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating certainty in the results.  

**Test Results:**  
1. `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`  
2. `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`  
3. `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`  
4. `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`  
5. `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`  
6. `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`  
7. `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`  
8. `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`  
9. `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`  
10. `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the constraints and logic of the puzzle.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`: Ensure valid digits and no leading zeros.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly models column addition with carry-over.  

All predicates function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for digit selection, uniqueness, and addition are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different/1` predicate terminates correctly for finite lists.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The results are deterministic (probability `1.0000`), indicating no probabilistic facts or negations are involved.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly enforced.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (digits 0–9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The `all_different/1` predicate may become inefficient for larger lists, but this is not an issue here.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

--- 

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and robust for the given cryptoaddition puzzle. No issues were identified in the test results or logic. Further enhancements could include handling invalid inputs or extending the puzzle to larger numbers.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
