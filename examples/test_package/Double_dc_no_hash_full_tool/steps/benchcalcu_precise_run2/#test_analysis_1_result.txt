### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Analysis Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The puzzle enforces the following constraints:  
- Each letter represents a unique digit (0–9).  
- The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
- The solution must account for carry-over during addition.  

The purpose of this report is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`. All solutions returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating certainty in the results.  

**Test Results:**  
1. `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`  
2. `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`  
3. `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`  
4. `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`  
5. `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`  
6. `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`  
7. `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`  
8. `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`  
9. `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`  
10. `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the constraints and logic of the puzzle.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`: Ensure valid digits and no leading zeros.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly models column addition with carry-over.  

All predicates function as intended.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for digit selection, uniqueness, and addition are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different/1` predicate terminates correctly for finite lists.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The results are deterministic (probability `1.0000`), indicating no probabilistic facts or negations are involved.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly enforced.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (digits 0–9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The `all_different/1` predicate may become inefficient for larger lists, but this is not an issue here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and robust for the given cryptoaddition puzzle. No issues were identified in the test results or logic. Further enhancements could include handling invalid inputs or extending the puzzle to larger numbers.
