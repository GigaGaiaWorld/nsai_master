           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 2:21.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog and ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/2` algorithm in Prolog, which is intended to sort a list of integers. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` using the predicate `forth_sort/2`, which internally calls `bubblesort/2`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 2:21.
  ```
  This indicates that the predicate `bubblesort/3` is undefined, while the code attempts to call it.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed because it relies on `bubblesort/3`, which is not defined in the provided code.  
- **Error Location**:  
  The error occurs in the line where `bubblesort/3` is called (line 2, column 21).  
- **Expected vs. Actual**:  
  - **Expected**: The predicate `bubblesort/3` should be defined to sort the list.  
  - **Actual**: The predicate is missing, leading to a runtime error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The provided `bubblesort/2` predicate is incomplete because it lacks the definition of `bubblesort/3`. The recursive logic for sorting is not fully implemented.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The termination condition (`is_sorted/1`) is not verified due to the missing predicate.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Not met due to the missing `bubblesort/3` predicate.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The input validation for non-list inputs is not handled.  
  - The recursive performance for large lists is untested.  
  - The `expand/2` predicate is not relevant here.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `bubblesort/3` predicate | Runtime error during execution  | Define `bubblesort/3` or correct the call to `bubblesort/2`. |
| 2      | Incomplete sorting logic         | Incorrect sorting functionality | Implement the full bubblesort algorithm, including helper predicates like `bubble_pass/2`. |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The current implementation of `bubblesort/2` is incomplete and fails due to the undefined `bubblesort/3` predicate. To fix this, the missing predicate must be implemented, and the sorting logic should be verified for correctness. The code does not involve probabilistic or DeepProbLog features, so the focus should be on classical Prolog correctness. Edge cases, such as non-list inputs, should also be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
