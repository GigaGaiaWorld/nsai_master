### Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog with Test Failures**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort` algorithm in Prolog, intended to sort a list of integers. The program includes predicates for checking if a list is sorted (`is_sorted/1`), performing a single pass of the bubble sort (`bubble_pass/2`), and the main sorting predicate (`bubblesort/2`). The test query `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)` is expected to return the sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`. However, the test results indicate a failure due to an undefined predicate.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`  
  - **Actual Result:**  
    ```prolog
    Error: No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 20:21.
    ```  
  - **Failure:** The query fails because the predicate `bubblesort/3` is called, but only `bubblesort/2` is defined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Error Location:** The error occurs in the call to `bubblesort/3` (line 20).  
  - **Root Cause:** The predicate `forth_sort/2` incorrectly calls `bubblesort/3` (with an extra accumulator argument), but the program only defines `bubblesort/2`.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `bubblesort/2` predicate is logically correct for sorting a list. It recursively applies `bubble_pass/2` until the list is sorted (`is_sorted/1`).  
  - The error arises from a mismatch between the predicate call (`bubblesort/3`) and its definition (`bubblesort/2`).  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion in `bubblesort/2` terminates correctly because `bubble_pass/2` reduces the problem size, and `is_sorted/1` ensures termination when the list is sorted.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The program does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features. The error is purely syntactic.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The `bubblesort/2` logic is correct for classical Prolog.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** DeepProbLog features are not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The program does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may cause stack overflow.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `bubblesort/3`         | Query fails                     | Correct the call to `bubblesort/2`  |
| 2   | Mismatched predicate arity       | Logical inconsistency           | Ensure predicate calls match definitions |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The program's core logic for `bubblesort/2` is correct, but the error stems from an incorrect predicate call (`bubblesort/3`). Fixing the predicate arity will resolve the issue. Edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs) should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
