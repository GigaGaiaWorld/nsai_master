### Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog and ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/2` algorithm in Prolog, which is intended to sort a list of integers. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` using the predicate `forth_sort/2`, which internally calls `bubblesort/2`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 2:21.
  ```
  This indicates that the predicate `bubblesort/3` is undefined, while the code attempts to call it.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed because it relies on `bubblesort/3`, which is not defined in the provided code.  
- **Error Location**:  
  The error occurs in the line where `bubblesort/3` is called (line 2, column 21).  
- **Expected vs. Actual**:  
  - **Expected**: The predicate `bubblesort/3` should be defined to sort the list.  
  - **Actual**: The predicate is missing, leading to a runtime error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The provided `bubblesort/2` predicate is incomplete because it lacks the definition of `bubblesort/3`. The recursive logic for sorting is not fully implemented.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The termination condition (`is_sorted/1`) is not verified due to the missing predicate.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Not met due to the missing `bubblesort/3` predicate.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The input validation for non-list inputs is not handled.  
  - The recursive performance for large lists is untested.  
  - The `expand/2` predicate is not relevant here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `bubblesort/3` predicate | Runtime error during execution  | Define `bubblesort/3` or correct the call to `bubblesort/2`. |
| 2      | Incomplete sorting logic         | Incorrect sorting functionality | Implement the full bubblesort algorithm, including helper predicates like `bubble_pass/2`. |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The current implementation of `bubblesort/2` is incomplete and fails due to the undefined `bubblesort/3` predicate. To fix this, the missing predicate must be implemented, and the sorting logic should be verified for correctness. The code does not involve probabilistic or DeepProbLog features, so the focus should be on classical Prolog correctness. Edge cases, such as non-list inputs, should also be addressed for robustness.
