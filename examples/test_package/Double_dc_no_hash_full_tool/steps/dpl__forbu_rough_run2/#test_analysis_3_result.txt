### Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog and ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in Prolog, with the goal of sorting a list of integers. The program includes predicates for checking if a list is sorted (`is_sorted/1`), performing a single pass of the bubblesort algorithm (`bubble_pass/2`), and the main sorting predicate (`bubblesort/2`). The `forth_sort/2` predicate is intended to wrap the `bubblesort/2` predicate. The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` is expected to return the sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of these failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 16:21.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `X = [1,2,3,5,7,12]`  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to undefined `bubblesort/3`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs because the predicate `bubblesort/3` is called in the definition of `forth_sort/2`, but it is not defined in the code. The code defines `bubblesort/2`, not `bubblesort/3`.  

- **Erroneous Predicate:** `forth_sort(L, L2) :- bubblesort(L, [], L2).`  
  - **Line Number:** The line where `forth_sort/2` is defined.  
  - **Issue:** The predicate `bubblesort/3` is undefined.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `bubblesort/2` predicate is correctly implemented and should work for sorting lists. However, the error arises from the incorrect call to `bubblesort/3` in `forth_sort/2`.  
  - The recursive termination of `bubblesort/2` is correct, as it stops when the list is sorted (`is_sorted(L)`).  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The `bubblesort/2` predicate meets the requirement for classical reasoning.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs, which could lead to errors.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the list, which is acceptable for small lists but may cause performance issues for very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `bubblesort/3`         | Prevents execution of `forth_sort/2` | Replace `bubblesort/3` with `bubblesort/2` in `forth_sort/2`. |
| 2      | Incorrect predicate call         | Misalignment between defined and called predicates | Ensure predicate arities match in calls and definitions. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The primary issue is the mismatch between the defined `bubblesort/2` and the called `bubblesort/3`. Correcting this will resolve the error. The rest of the implementation is logically sound for classical Prolog reasoning. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
