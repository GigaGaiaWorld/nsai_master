{
  "HASH": "DF1FDC54",
  "ErrorSummary": "Non-ground probabilistic clause in 'PH::make_coin(C,PH)' causing evaluation failure. The variable 'C' is uninstantiated, violating ProbLog's requirement for ground probabilistic facts.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the non-ground probabilistic fact with ground instances, e.g., '0.8::make_coin(c1).', '0.8::make_coin(c2).', etc. Alternatively, ensure 'C' is instantiated before use in probabilistic contexts.",
