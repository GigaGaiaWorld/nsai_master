### Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`) for sorting lists. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog requirements. The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` and verifying the output.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
- `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules involved in the implementation are as follows:  
- `merge_sort/2`: Base cases and recursive splitting (lines 1–7).  
- `split/3`: Splits the list into two halves (lines 8–10).  
- `merge/3`: Merges two sorted lists (lines 11–17).  

All predicates function as intended, and no errors were found in the classical or probabilistic contexts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm correctly implements the merge sort logic, including base cases, splitting, and merging.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as expected due to the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) and the splitting of lists into smaller sublists.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([], []).`  
- **Performance:** The recursive splitting and merging may face performance issues with very large lists due to stack usage.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
