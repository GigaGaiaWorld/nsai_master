  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core merge sort logic. Edge cases (non-list inputs, deep recursion) are not handled but were not part of the original requirements.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Optional: Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`) and tail recursion optimization for large lists if robustness is required.",
