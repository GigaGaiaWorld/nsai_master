</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`) for sorting lists. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog requirements. The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` and verifying the output.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
- `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules involved in the implementation are as follows:  
- `merge_sort/2`: Base cases and recursive splitting (lines 1–7).  
- `split/3`: Splits the list into two halves (lines 8–10).  
- `merge/3`: Merges two sorted lists (lines 11–17).  

All predicates function as intended, and no errors were found in the classical or probabilistic contexts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm correctly implements the merge sort logic, including base cases, splitting, and merging.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as expected due to the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) and the splitting of lists into smaller sublists.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([], []).`  
- **Performance:** The recursive splitting and merging may face performance issues with very large lists due to stack usage.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
