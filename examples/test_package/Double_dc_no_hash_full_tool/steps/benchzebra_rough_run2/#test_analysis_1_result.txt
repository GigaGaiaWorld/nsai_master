### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of given clues. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle, focusing on:
- Classical reasoning (logical constraints and recursive predicates).
- Test result verification.
- Edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Executed:**
  ```prolog
  query(zebra(Houses)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle.
  - All constraints (e.g., color, nationality, pet, drink, and cigarette) are satisfied.
  - **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly adheres to the puzzle's constraints and produces the expected output.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and terminate properly.
    - `my_member/2`: Recursively checks for membership in a list.
    - `next_to/3`: Uses `right_of/3` to check adjacency.
    - `right_of/3`: Recursively checks if one element is immediately to the right of another.
  - **Recursive Termination:** All recursive predicates have base cases and terminate correctly.
  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The puzzle does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are applicable.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logical constraints.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable here.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are defined.
  - **Non-list Input:** The `houses/1` predicate ensures the input is a list of 5 houses.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **Conclusion**
The ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle is correct and robust. All tests pass, and the logical constraints are accurately enforced. No edge cases or failures were identified. The solution adheres to classical Prolog reasoning without requiring probabilistic or DeepProbLog features.
