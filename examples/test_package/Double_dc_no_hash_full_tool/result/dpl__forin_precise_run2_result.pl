/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm accurately. The only differences are minor formatting changes, such as line breaks and spacing, which do not affect the code's execution or results. The generated code produces the same sorted list as the original code when queried with the same input.
