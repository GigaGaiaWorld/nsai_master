/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. The main issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause error, which occurs because the variable 'C' in 'coin(C)' is not properly instantiated. This makes the generated code invalid. Additionally, the generated code's logic differs from the original, particularly in how it handles coin flips and counts successes. The original code correctly accumulates successes over 4 coin flips with a probability of 0.8, while the generated code fails to execute due to the mentioned error.
