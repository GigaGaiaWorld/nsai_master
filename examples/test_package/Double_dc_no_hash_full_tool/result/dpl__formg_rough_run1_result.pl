/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in functionality. It implements the merge sort algorithm accurately, including the split and merge operations. The only difference is the renaming of the 'split_list' predicate to 'split', which does not affect the logic or outcome. Both codes produce the same sorted result for the given query.
