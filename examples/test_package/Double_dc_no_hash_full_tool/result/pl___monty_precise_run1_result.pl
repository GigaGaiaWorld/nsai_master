/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and logic. Both codes model the Monty Hall problem accurately, with the same probability distributions and query results. The generated code rearranges some conditions in the 'open_door' rules but maintains the same logical structure. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence.
