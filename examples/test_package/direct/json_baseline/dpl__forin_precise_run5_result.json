  "final_report": "The generated code is partially correct but incomplete. It defines the basic structure of insertion sort with predicates for insertion and sorting, but the 'langda' predicate is not properly implemented and appears to be a placeholder. The original code shows a complete implementation with correct results, while the generated code lacks the recursive sorting logic. The query format is correct, and the predicted result matches the original, but the implementation is not fully valid."
