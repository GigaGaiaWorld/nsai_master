  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem, maintaining consistency with the original code's logic and results. It accurately defines the probabilities for the prize distribution, the deterministic selection of door 1, and the winning conditions for both keeping and switching doors. The generated code also includes additional explanatory comments and uses a slightly different syntax for probability definitions, but the core logic remains intact. The running results of both codes are consistent, showing the same probabilities for prize distribution, door selection, and winning strategies."
