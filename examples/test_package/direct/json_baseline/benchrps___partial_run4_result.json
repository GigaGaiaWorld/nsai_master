  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct but contains some placeholder text (langda/LLM comments) that should be replaced with actual Prolog rules. The structure for determining the winner is present, but incomplete due to missing rules for 'paper' and 'scissor' moves and their win-lose relationships. The compute_score predicate is also incomplete. Despite these issues, the core logic for determining the winner is correctly implemented, and the result matches the original code's output."
