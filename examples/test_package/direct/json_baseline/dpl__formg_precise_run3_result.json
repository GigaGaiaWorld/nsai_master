  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and follows the structure of a merge sort algorithm. However, it contains placeholder comments (langda(LLM:...)) that are not valid Prolog syntax, which would prevent it from running as-is. The actual merge and split logic is correctly implemented. The original code's result shows a successful merge sort, and the generated code's predicted result matches this, indicating consistency in functionality when the placeholder issues are resolved."
