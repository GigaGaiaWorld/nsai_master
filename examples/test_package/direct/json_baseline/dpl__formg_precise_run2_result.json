  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and follows the structure of a merge sort algorithm. However, it contains placeholder comments (langda(LLM:...)) that are not valid Prolog syntax, which would cause the code to fail if executed. The actual implementation of merge_sort/2 is missing, and the split_list/3 predicate is defined but not used. The merge/3 and append/3 predicates are correctly implemented. The generated code's predicted result matches the original code's result, but the code itself is not fully valid due to the placeholder comments."
