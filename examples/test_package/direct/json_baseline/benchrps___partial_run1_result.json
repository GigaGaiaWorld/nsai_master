  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct but contains some placeholder comments (langda) and incomplete rules, particularly in the compute_score predicate where the lose and draw cases are not fully implemented. The structure and logic of the game are consistent with the original code, but the generated code is less complete. The running results of both codes are consistent, correctly identifying player2 as the winner."
