  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve the zebra puzzle using Prolog with some constraints implemented correctly, but it includes non-standard 'langda' predicates which are not part of standard Prolog or ProbLog. The original code provides a complete and correct solution to the zebra puzzle with clear house assignments. The generated code's predicted results are partially correct but incomplete and inconsistent with the original solution. The 'langda' predicates seem to be placeholders or incorrect implementations."
