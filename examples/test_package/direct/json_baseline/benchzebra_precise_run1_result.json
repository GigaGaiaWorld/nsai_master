  "final_report": "The generated code is a valid Prolog implementation of the zebra puzzle, correctly structuring the problem with houses and constraints. It uses helper predicates like right_of, next_to, and my_member effectively. However, it differs from the original code in format and some details (e.g., the original uses Problog for probabilistic inference, while the generated code is pure Prolog). The results are logically consistent but presented differently: the original gives a probabilistic output, while the generated code provides deterministic solutions. Both correctly identify the Japanese person as owning the zebra and the Norwegian drinking water."
