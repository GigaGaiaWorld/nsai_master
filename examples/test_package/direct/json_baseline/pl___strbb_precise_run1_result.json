  "final_report": "The generated code does not meet the expectations. While it introduces a new predicate `bb(N)` with a complex description, the actual implementation is missing or incorrect. The original code simply returns a probability for `bb(5)`, but the generated code's `bb(N)` predicate is not properly defined and relies on an unclear `langda` construct. The results are inconsistent, with the original showing 0.3750 and the generated code showing an undefined result (only listing `bb(5)` without a probability)."
