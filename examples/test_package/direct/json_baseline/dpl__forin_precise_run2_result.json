  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement insertion sort in Prolog but contains several issues. The main problem is the use of 'langda(LLM:...)' which is not valid Prolog syntax and appears to be a placeholder or incorrect implementation. The insert_element predicates are correctly defined but are not properly integrated into the insertion_sort predicate. The query format is correct but the implementation is incomplete. The predicted results match the original output, but this appears to be manually specified rather than generated by the actual code."
