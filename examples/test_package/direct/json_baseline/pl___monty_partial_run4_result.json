  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem, maintaining the same probabilistic structure as the original code. It defines the prize distribution, door selection, and winning conditions for both keeping and switching strategies. The use of `langda(LLM:...)` annotations, while unconventional, does not affect the logical correctness. The predicted results match the original output exactly, with identical probabilities for all queries."
