  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem but has several issues. It lacks a proper definition of the `open_door/1` predicate, which is crucial for the problem's logic. The placeholder text from 'langda' is not valid Problog syntax. The predicted results section contains a malformed clause for `open_door(D)` with a syntax error (duplicate `member(D, L)`). The original code shows correct probability distributions for the problem, while the generated code cannot produce valid results due to these syntax and logic errors."
