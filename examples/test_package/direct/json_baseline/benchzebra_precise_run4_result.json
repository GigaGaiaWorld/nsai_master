  "final_report": "The generated code is a valid Prolog implementation of the zebra puzzle, correctly structuring the problem with houses and constraints. It uses predicates like `right_of`, `next_to`, and `my_member` to enforce the puzzle rules. However, the generated code does not include the actual constraint-solving logic, relying instead on an LLM to interpret the rules. The original code provides a concrete solution with probabilities, while the generated code only outlines the problem structure and hints at a solution. The results are conceptually consistent but differ in presentation and completeness."
