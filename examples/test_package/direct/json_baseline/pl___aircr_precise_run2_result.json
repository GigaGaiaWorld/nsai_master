  "final_report": "The generated code does not meet expectations. While it attempts to model an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, it is incomplete and contains a placeholder (langda(LLM:...)) instead of proper Problog logic for calculating the attempted flap position. This makes the code invalid and unable to produce meaningful results. The original code provided clear probabilistic outcomes for goal_reached and overrun_exception, but the generated code fails to replicate this functionality due to its incomplete implementation."
