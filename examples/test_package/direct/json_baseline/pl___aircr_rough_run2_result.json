  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of structure and expected output. The original code provides specific probabilities for 'goal_reached' and 'overrun_exception' across different time steps, while the generated code introduces a different scenario involving aircraft flap control with different predicates and logic. The generated code also includes a placeholder for an LLM calculation, which is not executable in standard Problog. The results from the generated code do not match the format or values of the original output."
