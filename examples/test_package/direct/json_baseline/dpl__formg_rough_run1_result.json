  "final_report": "The generated code does not meet expectations as it does not implement the merge_sort/2 algorithm. Instead, it only provides a query and a basic append/3 predicate, which is unrelated to sorting. The original code demonstrates a working merge_sort/2 implementation with correct results, while the generated code lacks the necessary logic for sorting. The results are not consistent, and the generated code is incomplete."
