  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with different constraints and predicates compared to the original code. While the original code directly queries sums of specific digit lists, the generated code defines a more complex puzzle-solving framework. However, the generated code is incomplete and contains errors (e.g., 'langda(LLM:...)' is not valid Prolog syntax, and the 'result1: 9' etc. lines are not proper output). The results are not consistent with the original code's output format or content."
