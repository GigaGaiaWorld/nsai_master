  "final_report": "The generated code does not meet the expectations as it significantly deviates from the original code. The original code performs a multi-digit addition operation, while the generated code focuses on single-digit addition and includes unrelated langda predicates. The generated code's structure and logic are inconsistent with the original, and it fails to replicate the multi-digit addition functionality. Additionally, the generated code's result does not match the original's output format or content."
