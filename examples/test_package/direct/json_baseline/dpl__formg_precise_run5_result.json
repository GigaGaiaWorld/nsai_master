  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and follows the structure of a merge sort algorithm. It includes the necessary predicates for splitting the list, merging sorted sublists, and the base cases for empty and single-element lists. However, the generated code contains placeholder comments (langda(LLM:...)) that are not valid Prolog syntax, which affects its validity. The actual implementation of merge_sort/2 is missing, though the supporting predicates (split_list/3, merge/3, append/3) are correctly defined. The running result is consistent with the original code, predicting the correct sorted list [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]."
