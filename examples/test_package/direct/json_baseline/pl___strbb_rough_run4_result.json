  "final_report": "The generated code does not meet the expectations. It introduces a new problem about palindromes and random string generation, which is unrelated to the original code's simple probabilistic fact 'bb(5) = 0.3750'. The generated code's structure and logic are completely different from the original, and it includes undefined predicates like 'langda' and incomplete results ('result2: ...')."
