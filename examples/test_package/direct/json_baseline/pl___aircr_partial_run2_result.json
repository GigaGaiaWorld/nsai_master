  "final_report": "The generated code does not meet expectations. While it attempts to model an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, it contains placeholder text (langda(LLM:...)) instead of proper Problog syntax, making it invalid. The original code shows concrete probability results for goal_reached and overrun_exception, but the generated code fails to produce any executable logic for these predicates. The structure and intent of the two codes are inconsistent."
