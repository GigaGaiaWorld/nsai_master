  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to solve the zebra puzzle using Prolog with some additional LLM-generated constraints. While the structure is similar to the original, it introduces an unconventional 'langda' predicate that appears to be an LLM-specific construct not standard in Prolog. The generated solution correctly identifies the Japanese person owns the zebra and the Norwegian drinks water, matching the original result's logical conclusion. However, the implementation differs significantly in form and doesn't produce the exact same house arrangement output as the original Problog solution."
