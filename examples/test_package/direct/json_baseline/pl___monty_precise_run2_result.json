  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem, maintaining the same probabilistic structure as the original code. It accurately defines the prize distribution, door selection, and the rules for winning by keeping or switching doors. The use of `langda(LLM:)` for explaining the host's behavior is unconventional but doesn't affect the logic. The results match the original exactly, showing correct probabilities for all outcomes."
