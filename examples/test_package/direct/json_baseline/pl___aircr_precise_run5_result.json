  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of both structure and results. The original code provides specific probabilities for goal_reached and overrun_exception at different time steps, while the generated code uses a different approach with a language model (LLM) for position calculation and only provides rough estimates (0.5 and 0.1) for the probabilities. The generated code is syntactically valid but does not replicate the original model's behavior or results."
