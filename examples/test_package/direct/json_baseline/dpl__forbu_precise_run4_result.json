  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm in Prolog, but it contains several issues. The 'langda' predicate is not properly defined and appears to be a placeholder for LLM-generated comments rather than executable code. The 'bubblesort' predicate is incomplete and incorrectly structured, missing the recursive logic to properly sort the list. The 'hole' predicate is defined but not effectively used in the sorting process. The generated code does not match the original code's functionality or structure, and it fails to produce a correct sorting implementation."
