The original code shows a successful execution of the insertion sort with a probability result, while the generated code only predicts the sorted list without showing the implementation or probability. The generated code's form is invalid as it lacks the necessary Prolog rules to perform the sorting. However, the predicted result is consistent with the original code's output."
