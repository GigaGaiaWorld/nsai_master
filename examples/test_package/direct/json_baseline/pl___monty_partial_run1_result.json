  "final_report": "The generated code correctly models the Monty Hall problem, with appropriate rules for prize distribution, door selection, and host behavior. It maintains consistency with the original code's logic and results. The generated code introduces additional explanatory comments and uses a slightly different syntax (e.g., 1/3::prize(X) instead of uniform distribution), but the core logic remains intact. Both codes produce the same probabilities for win_keep (0.3333) and win_switch (0.6667), demonstrating correct implementation of the problem's dynamics."
