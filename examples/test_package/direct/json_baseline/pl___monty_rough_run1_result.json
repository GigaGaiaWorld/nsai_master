  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem but has several issues. It lacks a proper definition of the `open_door/1` predicate, which is crucial for the problem's logic. The provided `langda` comment suggests an implementation but isn't executable code. The predicted results section shows a partial implementation of `open_door/1` but is commented out and incomplete. The original code produces clear probabilities for keeping vs switching, while the generated code doesn't show equivalent functionality or results."
