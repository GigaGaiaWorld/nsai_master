/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code does not provide an actual implementation of the insertion_sort/2 algorithm, but rather shows a query and predicted results. It lacks the procedural logic expected in the original code. The results are consistent with the original output, but the form is incomplete as it doesn't include the sorting algorithm's definition.
