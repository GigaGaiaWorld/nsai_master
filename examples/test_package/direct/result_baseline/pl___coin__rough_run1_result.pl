/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to model a coin-tossing scenario similar to the original code but introduces unnecessary complexity and incorrect syntax. The original code directly computes the probabilities of getting 0 to 4 heads in 4 tosses of a biased coin (0.8 probability for heads). The generated code incorrectly uses 'langda' and 'PH::make_coin', which are not standard Problog constructs, leading to invalid syntax. However, the predicted results in the generated code match the original results, indicating the conceptual understanding is correct but the implementation is flawed.
