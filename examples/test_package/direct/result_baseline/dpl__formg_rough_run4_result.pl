/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code does not fully implement the merge_sort/2 algorithm as required. It only includes an append/3 predicate and a query, but lacks the actual merge_sort implementation. The original code successfully performs a merge sort, while the generated code does not provide the necessary logic to achieve this. The predicted result in the generated code matches the original result, but this is likely a placeholder or assumption rather than an actual computation.
