% Calculate the result of the game

% Same gestures are considered a draw
result(X, X, draw) :-
    move(X).
    
% If X beats Y, then X wins
result(X, Y, win) :-

% If Y beats X, then X loses
result(X, Y, lose) :-
beats(Y, X).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly correct in terms of implementing the rock-paper-scissors game logic, but it has several issues. First, it includes placeholder text ('langda(LLM:...)') that is not valid Problog syntax. Second, the 'determine_winner' predicate is incomplete and does not correctly compute the winner based on the results. The original code directly outputs the winner, while the generated code does not fully implement this logic. The running results are inconsistent: the original code outputs 'player2' as the winner, while the generated code does not produce a valid result for the winner.
