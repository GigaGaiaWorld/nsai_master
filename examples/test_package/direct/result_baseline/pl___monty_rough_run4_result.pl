/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to model the Monty Hall problem but has several issues. It lacks a complete definition of the `open_door/1` predicate, which is crucial for the problem's logic. The provided partial definition in the comment is not properly integrated into the code. The original code produces clear probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors, while the generated code's results cannot be verified due to the incomplete implementation. The structure of the problem is similar, but the execution is flawed.
