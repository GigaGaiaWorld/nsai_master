/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code does not provide an actual implementation of the insertion_sort/2 predicate, but rather shows a query and predicted results. The form is invalid as it lacks the core logic required for insertion sort. The results are consistent with the original output, but this is likely just a coincidence since no sorting logic is present in the generated code.
