/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the behavior of the original code but contains several issues. The original code uses a probabilistic model to calculate the distribution of successes (total) over 4 trials with a success probability of 0.8. The generated code introduces a non-standard predicate 'langda' and includes an unclear explanation in the middle of the code, which is not valid Problog syntax. The predicted results in the generated code match the original results, but the code structure is incorrect and not executable as-is.
