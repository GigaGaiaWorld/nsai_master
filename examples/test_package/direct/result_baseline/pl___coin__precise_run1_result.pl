/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the behavior of the original code, which calculates the probabilities of different success counts when flipping four biased coins (each with a 0.8 probability of heads). However, the generated code contains several issues. First, it uses an undefined predicate `langda` and includes a non-functional comment within the code body, which disrupts the logic. The original code's results are correctly calculated probabilities, while the generated code's results are listed without proper association to the success counts (0 to 4). The generated code's structure is inconsistent with standard Problog syntax and lacks clarity.
