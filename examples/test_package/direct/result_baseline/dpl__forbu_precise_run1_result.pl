/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to implement a sorting algorithm using Prolog, but it contains several issues. The 'bubblesort' predicate is incomplete and contains a placeholder 'langda(LLM:...)' which is not valid Prolog syntax. The 'hole' predicate is defined but not properly integrated into the sorting logic. The generated code does not correctly implement the sorting functionality as demonstrated by the original code. The predicted result matches the original, but this is likely coincidental given the code's flaws.
