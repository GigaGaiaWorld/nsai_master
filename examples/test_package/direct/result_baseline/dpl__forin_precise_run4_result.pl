/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to implement an insertion sort algorithm in Prolog. While the structure is generally correct with base and recursive cases for insertion_sort and insert_element, there is a critical issue in the recursive clause of insertion_sort where it uses 'langda(LLM:...)' which is not valid Prolog syntax and will cause the code to fail. The original code shows a correct implementation with proper recursive sorting and insertion. The expected result ([1,2,3,5,7,12]) is correct, but the generated code cannot produce it due to the syntax error.
