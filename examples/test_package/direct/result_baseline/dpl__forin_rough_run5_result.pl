% Predicted results by DeepSeek:
% result1: insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],[1,2,3,5,7,12])
result2: X = [1,2,3,5,7,12]

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code does not provide a complete implementation of the insertion_sort/2 algorithm as required. Instead, it includes a placeholder comment and a query that matches the original result. The form is invalid as it lacks the actual Prolog implementation. However, the result shown (X = [1,2,3,5,7,12]) is consistent with the original code's output, indicating the expected sorting is correct.
