/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not implement the merge_sort/2 algorithm as required. It only provides a basic append/3 predicate and a query, but lacks the actual merge_sort implementation. The original code's result shows a correct merge sort, while the generated code merely predicts the result without providing the logic to achieve it. This inconsistency indicates the generated code fails to meet the requirements.
