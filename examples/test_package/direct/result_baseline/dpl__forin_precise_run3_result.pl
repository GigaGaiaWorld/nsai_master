/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to implement an insertion sort in Prolog but contains several issues. The main problem is the use of 'langda(LLM:...)' which is not valid Prolog syntax and appears to be a placeholder or incorrect construct. The insertion logic (insert_element) is correctly implemented, but the overall structure is flawed due to the invalid predicate. The result prediction matches the original output, but this is likely coincidental given the code issues.
