% Cryptoaddition:
% Find the unique answer to:

% Define available digits
digit(0). digit(1). digit(2). digit(3). digit(4).
digit(5). digit(6). digit(7). digit(8). digit(9).

% The first digit of a multi-digit number cannot be 0
leftdigit(D) :- digit(D), D =\= 0.

% All elements are different
all_different([]).

% Simulate a column addition: Cin is the input carry, Cout is the output carry

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with constraints similar to the original code. However, it contains several issues: 1) The 'langda' predicate is undefined and appears to be an AI placeholder, 2) The code structure differs significantly from the original, which simply lists solutions, 3) The generated code's predicted result ('no_valid_solution') contradicts the original's multiple valid solutions. The generated code's form is problematic due to the undefined predicate and incorrect structure.
