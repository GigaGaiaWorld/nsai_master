          1. Check if the goal has been reached:
           If Old already satisfies goal(Old), no new trial position is calculated.
          
          2.Determine the current actuator and its strength:
           Select actuator A (use_actuator) according to time Time, and get its thrust AS from actuator_strength(A).
          
          3. Calculate the direction and contribution of the actuator
           Take the global target position GP (goal(GP)), and compare the difference direction between GP and Old:
           - If the target is in front of the current direction, AE = +AS; if in the opposite direction, AE = −AS;
           - Specific calculation: AE = sign(GP − Old) × AS.
          
          4. Superimpose wind interference:
           Take the additional effect WE of the wind force on the position at that moment from wind_effect(Time).

          Add the three parts and get the current attempt flapping position Pos.").

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not meet expectations. While it attempts to model an aircraft flap controller with probabilistic elements, it is incomplete and contains a placeholder (langda(LLM:...)) instead of proper Problog logic for calculating the attempted flap position. This makes the code invalid and unable to produce meaningful results. The original code provided clear probabilistic outcomes for goal_reached and overrun_exception, but the generated code fails to replicate this functionality due to its incomplete implementation.
