/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It correctly implements stack operations like push, pop, dup, swap, over, and rot. However, the generated code includes an additional operation 'sort' and a helper predicate 'get_top_n' which were not present in the original code. The running results of the generated code match the original results for all common operations, except for 'rot' where the generated result is [2,3,1,4] instead of [3,1,2,4]. This discrepancy indicates a minor error in the 'rot' implementation.
