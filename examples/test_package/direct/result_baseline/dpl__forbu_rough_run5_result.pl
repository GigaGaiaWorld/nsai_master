/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm but is incomplete as it does not define the 'bubblesort' predicate. The original code shows a working 'forth_sort' predicate that correctly sorts the list [3,1,2,5,7,12] to [1,2,3,5,7,12]. The generated code's predicted results are consistent with the original code's output, but the code itself is not valid due to the missing implementation of 'bubblesort'.
