/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to solve the zebra puzzle using Prolog with some additional LLM-generated constraints. While the structure is different from the original Problog code, it correctly implements the puzzle rules. The generated code is valid in form, but it uses a non-standard approach with 'langda(LLM:...)' which isn't standard Prolog syntax. The results are consistent with the original, correctly identifying the Japanese person owns the zebra and the Norwegian drinks water, though the house representation format differs slightly.
