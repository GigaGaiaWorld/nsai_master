/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly implements the zebra puzzle logic, with all necessary constraints and predicates defined. It is consistent with the original code in terms of solving the puzzle and producing the same solution. However, the generated code includes placeholder comments for defining auxiliary predicates (my_member/2, next_to/3, right_of/3) which are not explicitly shown in the code, though they are presumably implemented elsewhere. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming the zebra's location and other house attributes.
