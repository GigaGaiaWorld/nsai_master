/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is mostly correct and follows the structure of a merge sort algorithm. However, it contains placeholder comments (langda(LLM:...)) which are not valid Prolog syntax and should be replaced with actual Prolog rules. The split_list and merge predicates are correctly implemented, and the query is properly set up. The predicted result matches the original code's output, indicating functional consistency.
