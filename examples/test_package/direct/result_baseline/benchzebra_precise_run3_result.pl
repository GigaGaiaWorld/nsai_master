/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to solve the zebra puzzle using Prolog with some custom predicates. However, it differs significantly from the original Problog solution in both structure and approach. The original code provides a direct solution with specific house arrangements, while the generated code uses a more abstract approach with placeholders and rules. The generated code's result format doesn't match the original's structured output, and it includes an unconventional 'langda(LLM:...)' predicate that doesn't appear to be standard Prolog or Problog syntax. The generated solution also shows two different result formats (result1 and result2) which are inconsistent with each other and with the original output.
