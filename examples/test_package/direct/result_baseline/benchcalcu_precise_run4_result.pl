% Cryptoaddition:
% Find the unique answer to:

% Define available digits
digit(0). digit(1). digit(2). digit(3). digit(4).
digit(5). digit(6). digit(7). digit(8). digit(9).

% The first digit of a multi-digit number cannot be 0
leftdigit(D) :- digit(D), D =\= 0.

% All elements are different
all_different([]).
all_different([H|T]) :- \+ member(H, T), all_different(T).

member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).

% Simulate a column addition: Cin is the input carry, Cout is the output carry

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with different constraints and predicates compared to the original code. While the original code directly queries sums of specific digit lists, the generated code defines a more complex puzzle-solving framework. However, the generated code is incomplete and contains errors (e.g., 'langda(LLM:...)' is not valid Prolog syntax, and the 'result1: 9' etc. lines are not proper output). The results are not consistent with the original code's output format or content.
