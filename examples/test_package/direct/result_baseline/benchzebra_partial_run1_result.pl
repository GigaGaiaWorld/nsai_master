/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to solve the zebra puzzle using Prolog with some constraints implemented correctly, but it mixes Prolog with unspecified 'langda(LLM:...)' predicates which are not standard and likely non-functional. The original code provides a complete and correct solution to the zebra puzzle, while the generated code is incomplete and contains undefined predicates. The results are inconsistent; the original code outputs a fully solved puzzle, whereas the generated code only provides partial predictions without complete inference.
