/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly implements the stack operations (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot) and matches the functionality of the original code. The results produced by the generated code are consistent with the original results, showing the same stack transformations. However, the generated code includes an additional 'sort' operation and a 'get_top_n' predicate, which were not present in the original code but do not affect the validity of the core operations. The form of the generated code is valid, and the results align perfectly with the original.
