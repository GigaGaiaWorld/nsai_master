/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors and includes a scoring mechanism to determine the winner. However, it lacks the 'play' predicate which is essential for comparing moves between players. The original code directly computes the winner, while the generated code is incomplete and cannot produce the expected result without the missing predicate. The generated code's structure is logical but incomplete, leading to inconsistency with the original code's output.
