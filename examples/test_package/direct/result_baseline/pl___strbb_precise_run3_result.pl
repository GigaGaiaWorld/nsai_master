% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
      palindrome(1,N).

% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
      pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A < B,
      pick(A,X),
      pick(B,X),
      AA is A+1,
      BB is B-1, 
      palindrome(AA,BB).

bb(N) :-
      langda(LLM:"The function of the predicate bb(N) is: for a string of length N, it checks whether there is a pair of adjacent positions in which the character b is generated.
      First calculate the maximum starting position Max = N-1;
      Enumerate each position I between 1 and Max;
      For each I, it requires that b is generated at position I (pick(I,b)), and b is also generated at the next position I+1 (pick(I+1,b));
      If any such pair of adjacent positions is found, then bb(N) is true.").

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not meet the expectations. While it attempts to define a predicate `bb(N)` that checks for adjacent 'b' characters in a string of length N, the implementation is incorrect and inconsistent with the original code's simple output. The generated code includes unnecessary and complex logic for palindrome checking which is unrelated to the original task. The original code simply outputs a probability for `bb(5)`, while the generated code's output format and logic are mismatched.
