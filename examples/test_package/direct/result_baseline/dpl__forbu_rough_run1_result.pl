/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to implement a bubblesort algorithm but is incomplete and contains syntax errors (e.g., 'langda' is not valid Prolog). The original code shows a working forth_sort/2 predicate with correct results, while the generated code fails to provide a valid implementation. The predicted results in the generated code match the original output, but this is likely just a manual annotation rather than actual execution.
