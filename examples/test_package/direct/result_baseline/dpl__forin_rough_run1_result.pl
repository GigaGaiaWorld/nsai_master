/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code does not provide an actual implementation of the insertion_sort/2 algorithm, but rather includes a placeholder comment and a query. The original code shows a correct implementation and result of insertion sort, while the generated code only predicts results without showing the algorithm's logic. The results are consistent, but the generated code fails to meet the requirement of providing an interpretable insertion sort implementation.
