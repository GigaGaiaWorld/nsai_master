/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code introduces new concepts and rules not present in the original code, such as 'slippery' predicates and additional probabilistic events. While it attempts to model similar scenarios (robot movement and key carrying), the implementation differs significantly. The original code provides specific probabilities for states at time s(s(s(0))), while the generated code focuses more on action outcomes and slippery conditions. The generated code is syntactically valid but doesn't produce results consistent with the original.
