/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to replicate the behavior of the original code but contains several issues. The original code uses Problog to calculate probabilities for different totals of successful coin flips, while the generated code mixes Problog syntax with unclear pseudo-code and a non-standard 'langda' predicate. The generated code's structure is inconsistent with typical Problog or DeepProbLog syntax, making it invalid. However, the predicted results in the generated code match the original results, suggesting the underlying logic was understood but not correctly implemented.
