/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to model a coin-tossing scenario similar to the original code, but it contains several issues. The 'langda' predicate is not properly defined, and the logic for counting heads is unclear. Despite these problems, the predicted results match the original results exactly, suggesting the underlying probabilistic model is correct. The generated code is not syntactically valid due to the undefined 'langda' predicate and improper use of 'PH::make_coin'.
