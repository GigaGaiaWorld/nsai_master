% Cryptoaddition:
% Find the unique answer to:

% Define available digits
digit(0). digit(1). digit(2). digit(3). digit(4).
digit(5). digit(6). digit(7). digit(8). digit(9).

% The first digit of a multi-digit number cannot be 0
leftdigit(D) :- digit(D), D =\= 0.

% All elements are different
all_different([]).
all_different([H|T]) :- \+ member(H, T), all_different(T).

% Simulate a column addition: Cin is the input carry, Cout is the output carry

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) using Prolog, but it contains several issues. The code structure is incomplete and contains a placeholder 'langda(LLM:...)' which is not valid Prolog syntax. The original code shows successful query results for specific digit combinations, while the generated code fails to produce any valid solutions due to its incorrect implementation. The generated code does not correctly implement the cryptarithmetic logic and lacks proper predicate definitions for solving the puzzle.
