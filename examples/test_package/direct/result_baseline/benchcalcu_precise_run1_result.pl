/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE) with different constraints and logic compared to the original code. While the generated code is syntactically valid and follows a logical structure for cryptarithmetic problems, it does not match the original code's functionality or results. The original code appears to simply list certain combinations with a probability of 1.0, while the generated code tries to solve a specific puzzle with unique digit assignments. The results are not consistent, and the generated code's output (query_sum([1, 9, 2, 0, 8])) does not appear in the original results.
