/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code introduces new probabilistic rules and actions not present in the original code, such as 'pickup_succeeds', 'drops', and 'slippery' predicates. While it attempts to model similar scenarios (robot carrying a key and moving between locations), the logic and probabilities differ significantly. The original code's results show specific probabilities for the robot's location and key carrying state at time s(s(s(0))), whereas the generated code's predicted results (0.504 for carrying and 0.9 for robot location) do not match these values. The generated code is more complex but does not replicate the original's behavior.
