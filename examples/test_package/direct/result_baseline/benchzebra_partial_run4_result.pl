/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to solve the zebra puzzle using Prolog with some constraints implemented correctly, but it includes placeholder-like 'langda(LLM:...)' statements that are not valid Prolog syntax. The original code provides a complete solution with specific house assignments, while the generated code only lists partial predictions without a complete solution. The generated code's structure is problematic due to invalid syntax and incomplete implementation.
