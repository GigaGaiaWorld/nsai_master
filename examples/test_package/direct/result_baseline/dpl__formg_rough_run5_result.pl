/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not implement the merge_sort/2 algorithm as required. It only provides a query and some predicted results without the actual sorting logic. The original code shows a correct implementation of merge_sort with a valid result. The generated code is incomplete and lacks the necessary predicates to perform the sorting operation.
