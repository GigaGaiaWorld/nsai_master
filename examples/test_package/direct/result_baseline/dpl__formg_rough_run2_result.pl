/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not fully implement the merge_sort/2 algorithm as expected. While it includes a basic append/3 predicate, it lacks the actual merge_sort implementation. The query is correctly stated, but the predicted result is merely a repetition of the expected output without demonstrating the sorting logic. The original code's result shows a correct sorted list, but the generated code fails to provide the necessary Prolog predicates to achieve this.
