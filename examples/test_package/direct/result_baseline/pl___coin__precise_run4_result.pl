/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not meet the expectations. While it attempts to model a similar probabilistic scenario (likely coin flips with a given probability), the implementation is incorrect and incomplete. The generated code contains placeholder text ('langda(LLM:...)') instead of proper Problog syntax, and the logic for counting successes is not properly defined. The original code clearly defines a probabilistic model and computes the distribution of successes, whereas the generated code fails to do so correctly.
