/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to model a coin-tossing scenario similar to the original, but it contains several issues. The main problem is the use of 'langda' and 'LLM' which are not standard Problog predicates, making the code invalid. The original code's results show probabilities for total heads in 4 coin tosses with a bias (likely 0.8 for heads), while the generated code's predicted results match these probabilities but are not derived from valid Problog syntax.
