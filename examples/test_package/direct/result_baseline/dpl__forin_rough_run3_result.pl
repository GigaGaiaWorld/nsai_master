/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code does not provide the actual Prolog implementation of the insertion_sort/2 predicate, but rather a description and a query. The original code shows a successful execution of the insertion sort with a probability result, while the generated code only predicts the sorted list without showing the implementation or probability. The generated code's form is invalid as it lacks the necessary Prolog rules to perform the sorting. However, the predicted result is consistent with the original code's output.
