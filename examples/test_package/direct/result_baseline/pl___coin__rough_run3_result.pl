/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code attempts to model a coin-tossing scenario similar to the original code but uses a different approach with `make_coin` and `coins_r` predicates. However, the generated code contains a placeholder (`langda(LLM:...)`) instead of actual logic for sampling coins, making it incomplete and invalid. The predicted results in the generated code match the original results, but this is likely hardcoded rather than derived from proper execution.
