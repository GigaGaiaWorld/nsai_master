palindrome(N) :-
      palindrome(1,N).

% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
      pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A < B,
      pick(A,X),

      AA is A+1,

      First calculate the maximum starting position Max = N-1;
      Enumerate each position I between 1 and Max;
      For each I, it requires that b is generated at position I (pick(I,b)), and b is also generated at the next position I+1 (pick(I+1,b));

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not meet the expectations. While it attempts to define a predicate `bb(N)` that checks for adjacent 'b' characters in a string of length N, the implementation is incorrect and incomplete. The original code's result shows `bb(5) = 0.3750`, but the generated code does not provide a correct implementation to achieve this result. The `bb(N)` predicate is described in a comment but not properly defined in the code. Additionally, the generated code includes unrelated predicates for palindrome checking, which are not part of the original task.
