/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors and includes a scoring mechanism to determine the winner. However, it lacks the 'play' predicate which is crucial for comparing moves between players. The original code directly provides the result without showing the implementation, making it hard to compare fully. The generated code's structure is logical but incomplete, affecting its validity. The expected result (player2 wins) is not explicitly shown in the generated code's output, only the query is repeated.
