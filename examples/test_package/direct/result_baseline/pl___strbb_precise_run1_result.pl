% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
      palindrome(1,N).

% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
      pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A < B,
      pick(A,X),
      pick(B,X),
      AA is A+1,
      BB is B-1,

bb(N) :-
      langda(LLM:"The function of the predicate bb(N) is: for a string of length N, it checks whether there is a pair of adjacent positions in which the character b is generated.
      First calculate the maximum starting position Max = N-1;
      Enumerate each position I between 1 and Max;
      For each I, it requires that b is generated at position I (pick(I,b)), and b is also generated at the next position I+1 (pick(I+1,b));

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not meet the expectations. While it introduces a new predicate `bb(N)` with a complex description, the actual implementation is missing or incorrect. The original code simply returns a probability for `bb(5)`, but the generated code's `bb(N)` predicate is not properly defined and relies on an unclear `langda` construct. The results are inconsistent, with the original showing 0.3750 and the generated code showing an undefined result (only listing `bb(5)` without a probability).
