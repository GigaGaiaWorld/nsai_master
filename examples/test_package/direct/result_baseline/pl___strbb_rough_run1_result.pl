% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
      palindrome(1,N).

% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
      pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
      A < B,
      pick(A,X),
      pick(B,X),
      AA is A+1,
      BB is B-1, 
      palindrome(AA,BB).

      langda(LLM:"Define bb(N) to succeed exactly when, in a random string of length N (positions 1…N), there exists an index I (1 ≤ I < N) such that both position I and I+1 generate the character b.").

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code does not meet expectations. While it attempts to define a palindrome and includes some probabilistic elements, it does not correctly implement the required logic for 'bb(N)' which should check for consecutive 'b's in a random string. The original code's result (0.3750) is not replicated or explained in the generated code. The generated code also includes irrelevant elements like 'langda(LLM:...)' which is not valid Problog syntax.
