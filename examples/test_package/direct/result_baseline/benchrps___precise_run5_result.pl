/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is mostly correct and follows the logic of the original code. It defines the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors and includes predicates to determine the result of each round and compute the final score. However, there are some issues: 1) The 'langda' predicate is not standard Prolog/ProbLog syntax and seems to be a placeholder or comment, which could cause errors. 2) The 'compute_score' predicate for 'lose' is missing, which is crucial for calculating the final score. 3) The generated code does not fully implement the 'determine_winner' predicate as it lacks the logic to compare scores and decide the winner. Despite these issues, the predicted results match the original output, showing consistency in the game logic.
