/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is a Prolog implementation of the zebra puzzle, similar to the original Problog solution. It correctly defines the puzzle constraints and uses helper predicates like `right_of`, `next_to`, and `my_member`. However, it introduces `langda(LLM:...)` predicates, which are not standard Prolog and seem to be placeholders for external reasoning. The generated code's predicted results partially match the original output but lack some details (e.g., missing fox, water, etc.). The original code provides a complete solution with probabilities, while the generated code only lists partial house attributes.
