  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes correctly model the Monty Hall problem, with identical probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors. The generated code introduces minor syntactic changes, such as adding 'select_door(Selected)' in the open_door rules, but these do not affect the logic or outcomes. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
