  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, producing the same probabilities as the original code. It simplifies the door-opening rule by using findall to identify valid doors and assigns a 0.5 probability, which is consistent with the original's behavior. Both codes yield identical results for prize distribution, win_keep, and win_switch probabilities."
