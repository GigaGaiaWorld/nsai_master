  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining the same probabilistic behavior as the original code. It simplifies the door-opening rule by using a findall predicate to identify valid doors, which is more concise but functionally equivalent. Both codes produce identical results, confirming the 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice and 2/3 chance by switching."
