  "final_report": "The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. It introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause error, which occurs because the variable 'C' in 'coin(C)' is not properly instantiated before being used in the probabilistic clause 'PH::make_coin(C,PH)'. This makes the code invalid. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic logic by instantiating 'C' within the context of the 'coins_r' predicate. The generated code fails to replicate the original's behavior and results in an error during execution."
