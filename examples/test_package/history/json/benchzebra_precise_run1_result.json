  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, there is a syntax error in the 'my_member' clause for 'snail' (should be 'snails'). Second, the 'my_member' clause for water has an extra parameter. These errors prevent the code from running correctly. The original code produces a valid solution to the zebra puzzle, while the generated code fails to do so due to these errors."
