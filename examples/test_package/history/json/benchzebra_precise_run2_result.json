  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue: it uses 'snail' instead of 'snails' in the my_member predicate. This does not affect the overall logic or result, as the variable name is arbitrary. The structure and constraints of the zebra puzzle are preserved, and the running results are identical."
