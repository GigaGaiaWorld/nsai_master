  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally identical to the original code, with only minor formatting differences such as spacing and line breaks. Both codes implement the merge sort algorithm correctly, splitting the list, recursively sorting the sublists, and merging them back together. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the same sorted output for the given input. There are no functional or logical discrepancies between the two versions."
