  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. The original code uses a disjunction (;) within the recursive clause to handle both success and failure of the coin/1 predicate, while the generated code separates these cases into two distinct clauses. This structural change does not affect the logic or the results, as evidenced by the identical run results. Both codes correctly model the probabilistic scenario of flipping four coins with an 80% chance of success each."
