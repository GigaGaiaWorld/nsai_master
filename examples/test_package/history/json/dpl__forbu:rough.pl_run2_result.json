  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid as it results in an error during execution. The error indicates that there are no clauses found for the '->/2' operator, which is used in the conditional statement within the bubblesort predicate. This suggests that the generated code does not correctly implement the bubble sort algorithm as intended. The original code successfully sorts the list using a bubble sort algorithm with a clear swap mechanism, while the generated code fails to execute due to incorrect use of Prolog syntax and logic."
