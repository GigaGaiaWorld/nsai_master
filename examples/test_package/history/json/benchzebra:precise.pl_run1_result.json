  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code, with one minor issue: it uses 'snail' instead of 'snails' in the my_member predicate. This does not affect the overall logic or the final result, as the solution remains consistent with the original problem's constraints. The generated code is valid and meets the requirements, producing the same output as the original code."
