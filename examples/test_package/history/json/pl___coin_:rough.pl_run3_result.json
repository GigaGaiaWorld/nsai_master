  "final_report": "The generated code is not consistent with the original code. The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips over 4 trials, each with a 0.8 probability of success. The generated code incorrectly hardcodes a single coin flip (c1) and does not iterate properly over the 4 trials, leading to incorrect results. The generated code's output only shows one result (total(4) = 0.8000), which is not consistent with the original code's probabilistic distribution over all possible outcomes (0 to 4 successes)."
