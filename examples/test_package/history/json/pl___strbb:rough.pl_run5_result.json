  "final_report": "The generated code is syntactically correct and maintains the same logical structure as the original code. However, the implementation of the 'bb' predicate differs slightly. The original code uses 'Max is N-1' and checks 'between(1,Max,I)', while the generated code directly checks 'I < N' within the 'between' predicate. This change affects the probability calculation, leading to a different result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is valid but produces inconsistent results due to the altered condition in the 'bb' predicate."
