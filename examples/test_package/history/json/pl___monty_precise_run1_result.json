  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes model the Monty Hall problem accurately, with the same probability distributions for the queries. The generated code introduces a 'Selected' variable in the 'open_door' rules, which is not used but does not affect the logic. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
