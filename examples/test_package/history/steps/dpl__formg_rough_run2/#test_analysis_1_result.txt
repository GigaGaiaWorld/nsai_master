# Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against test cases and analyze its compliance with functional requirements in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with 100% probability.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. Comparison of elements during merge

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The implementation follows standard merge sort algorithm:
     - Base cases (lines 1-2) correctly handle empty and single-element lists
     - Recursive case (lines 3-8) properly splits, recursively sorts, and merges
     - Split predicate (lines 9-11) correctly divides the list into two halves
     - Merge predicate (lines 12-19) correctly combines sorted lists

2. **Recursive Termination:**
   - The recursion terminates because each recursive call works on a smaller sublist (length is halved each time)

3. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met:**
   - Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases Consideration:**
   - Handles empty list and single-element list correctly
   - Properly processes even and odd length lists
   - Correctly maintains sorted order during merge

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - Could add type checking for list input
   - Could optimize tail recursion where possible
   - Could add more test cases for edge scenarios
