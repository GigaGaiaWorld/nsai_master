# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The system should correctly evaluate game results according to standard rock-paper-scissors rules and calculate the final winner.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
This indicates a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate (line 41) where there appears to be:
1. A malformed if-then-else construct (`->/2`)
2. An incomplete predicate definition (cut off mid-definition)
3. The correct implementation (provided in the `<Langda>` block) wasn't properly integrated

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues are:
1. **Syntax Error**: The `determine_winner` predicate is incomplete and contains malformed Prolog syntax
2. **Implementation Gap**: The working implementation shown in the `<Langda>` block wasn't properly inserted into the main code
3. **Classical Logic**: The core game logic (move/1, beats/2, result/3) is correctly implemented
4. **Recursion**: The play/3 and compute_score/2 predicates have proper base cases and recursive steps

The probabilistic and DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
- Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

**Edge Cases**:
1. Non-list inputs would cause type errors
2. Uneven move lists would cause failure
3. Invalid moves would not be handled
4. Deep recursion could cause stack issues with very long game sequences

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete `determine_winner` predicate | Cannot determine final winner | Insert correct implementation from `<Langda>` block |
| 2 | Malformed if-then-else syntax | Predicate fails to compile | Fix syntax using proper Prolog conditional structure |
| 3 | No input validation | Invalid moves would cause errors | Add move validation before processing |

**Correct Implementation**:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

The core game logic is sound, but the predicate connecting the components needs correction. Once fixed, the system should properly evaluate rock-paper-scissors matches according to the specified requirements.
