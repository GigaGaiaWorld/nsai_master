</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that calculates match results between two players. The system should determine the winner based on sequences of moves, handling win/lose/draw conditions according to standard game rules.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
This indicates a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate implementation.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (missing closing parenthesis)
2. Improper use of conditional operator `->/2` syntax
3. The predicate body was cut off mid-implementation in the provided code

## Root Cause Analysis
The core logic issues are:
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The recursive `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are correctly defined with proper termination conditions
   - The move/beats relationships are correctly specified
   - The error is purely syntactic, not logical

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The report "DeepProbLog feature not used" as there are no neural network integrations

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning requirements are partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning and neural network integration are not implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs aren't handled
   - Uneven move lists would cause failure
   - No input validation for valid moves
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with very long games

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Compilation fails | Complete the `determine_winner` implementation |
| 2 | Improper conditional syntax | Runtime error | Fix `->/2` operator usage |
| 3 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation checks |

## Corrected Implementation
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

The corrected version properly:
1. Chains the play and score computation
2. Uses proper conditional syntax
3. Returns the appropriate winner based on score
4. Handles the draw case explicitly

With this correction, the test query would return:
```
W = 'Player 2'
```
As Player 2 wins 2 rounds (paper beats rock twice) and loses 1 round (scissor loses to rock).

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
