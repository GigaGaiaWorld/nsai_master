# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that calculates match results between two players. The system should determine the winner based on sequences of moves, handling win/lose/draw conditions according to standard game rules.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
This indicates a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate implementation.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (missing closing parenthesis)
2. Improper use of conditional operator `->/2` syntax
3. The predicate body was cut off mid-implementation in the provided code

## Root Cause Analysis
The core logic issues are:
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The recursive `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are correctly defined with proper termination conditions
   - The move/beats relationships are correctly specified
   - The error is purely syntactic, not logical

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The report "DeepProbLog feature not used" as there are no neural network integrations

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning requirements are partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning and neural network integration are not implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs aren't handled
   - Uneven move lists would cause failure
   - No input validation for valid moves
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with very long games

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Compilation fails | Complete the `determine_winner` implementation |
| 2 | Improper conditional syntax | Runtime error | Fix `->/2` operator usage |
| 3 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation checks |

## Corrected Implementation
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

The corrected version properly:
1. Chains the play and score computation
2. Uses proper conditional syntax
3. Returns the appropriate winner based on score
4. Handles the draw case explicitly

With this correction, the test query would return:
```
W = 'Player 2'
```
As Player 2 wins 2 rounds (paper beats rock twice) and loses 1 round (scissor loses to rock).
