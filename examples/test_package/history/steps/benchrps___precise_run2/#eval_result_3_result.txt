  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the incomplete determine_winner predicate in the main code with the correct implementation from the <Langda> block. The correct implementation is: determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').",
