# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that includes move definitions, result calculation, score computation, and winner determination. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and identify any issues in the logic or syntax.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case `query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W))` resulted in an error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Error Location**: The error occurs at line 41, position 77 in the code
2. **Problematic Predicate**: The `determine_winner/3` predicate definition is incomplete and contains a syntax error
3. **Specific Issue**: The predicate definition is cut off mid-implementation and not properly terminated

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Analysis**:
   - The basic move and beats relationships are correctly defined
   - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are logically sound
   - The `compute_score/2` predicate handles all three cases (win, lose, draw) correctly
   - The recursive definitions have proper base cases and termination conditions

2. **ProbLog Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The code is purely deterministic classical Prolog
   - DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

3. **Syntax Issues**:
   - The `determine_winner/3` predicate is not properly completed
   - There's a line break in the middle of the predicate definition
   - The implementation from the Langda block (hash 4E6CE90A) should be used but isn't properly integrated

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning requirements are mostly met except for the broken winner determination
   - Probabilistic reasoning requirements are not applicable (not implemented)
   - Neural network integration is not used (as expected for this simple game)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Unequal length move lists would cause issues
   - Invalid moves would not be properly validated
   - The score computation could overflow with very long games

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete `determine_winner` predicate | Cannot determine game winner | Use the complete implementation from Langda block 4E6CE90A |
| 2 | Typo in test case ("scissor" vs "scissor") | Would cause failure if predicate worked | Fix spelling in test case |
| 3 | No input validation | Invalid moves would cause silent failures | Add move validation predicate |
| 4 | No length checking | Unequal move lists would cause issues | Add length verification |

**Recommendation**: The main fix needed is to properly implement the `determine_winner/3` predicate using the correct implementation shown in the Langda block (hash 4E6CE90A). The rest of the logic appears sound for a basic implementation. For a more robust solution, input validation and error handling should be added.
