# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of logical constraints. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and analyze its compliance with logical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows a single successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, producing the expected arrangement of houses with full probability (1.0000).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All constraints specified in the puzzle are correctly implemented:
1. House color-nationality constraints (red-English, blue-Norwegian neighbor)
2. Pet ownership constraints (Spanish-dog, snail-Winstons)
3. Beverage preferences (green-coffee, milk in middle house)
4. Smoking preferences (yellow-Kools, Japanese-Parliaments)
5. Positional relationships (green right of ivory, Norwegian in first house)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical Prolog reasoning:
1. **Logical correctness**: All constraints are properly translated into Prolog predicates
2. **Recursive termination**: Helper predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) all have proper base cases and recursive cases
3. **Probabilistic aspects**: The solution shows deterministic reasoning (all probabilities = 1.0) as expected for this puzzle
4. **DeepProbLog features**: Not used in this implementation (no neural network components)

Key successful aspects:
- Correct handling of positional constraints through recursive predicates
- Proper unification of house attributes
- Complete coverage of all puzzle constraints

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Perfectly solves the logical puzzle
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not heavily utilized (only deterministic results)
3. **Neural network integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used)

Edge cases considered:
- House position numbering (fixed 5-house structure)
- Middle house constraint explicitly handled
- All attribute combinations properly constrained
- Positional relationships correctly implemented

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly encoded and verified. The solution demonstrates solid Prolog programming practices and accurate translation of logical constraints into executable code.
