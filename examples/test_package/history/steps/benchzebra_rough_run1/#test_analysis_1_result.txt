# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly satisfied.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with a single query:
```prolog
query(zebra(Houses)).
```

**Result:**
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as evidenced by the complete and consistent house arrangement returned with probability 1.0.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The main `zebra/1` predicate correctly encodes all puzzle constraints
   - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) properly terminate
   - All constraints are satisfied in the solution:
     - Nationalities, colors, pets, drinks, and cigarettes match all given rules
     - Spatial relationships (right_of, next_to) are correctly implemented

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The solution shows probability 1.0, indicating certainty in the solution
   - No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this classical implementation
   - DeepProbLog features were not used (no neural network integration)

3. **Helper Predicates:**
   - `my_member/2` correctly implements list membership
   - `right_of/3` properly checks positional relationships
   - `next_to/3` correctly handles adjacency in both directions

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - Classical reasoning: Fully met (all constraints correctly implemented)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (classical Prolog solution)
   - Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not required)

2. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - List handling: Properly managed in all predicates
   - Positional relationships: Correctly implemented for all house positions
   - Recursion: All recursive predicates have proper base cases

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - Could add input validation for house structures
   - Might include probabilistic version with uncertain constraints
   - Could optimize ordering of constraints for better performance

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation successfully solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly satisfied. The code is logically correct and well-structured for this classical Prolog problem. No errors or improvements were identified in the current implementation.
