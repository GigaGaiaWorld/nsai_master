# ProbLog Meta-Interpreter Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog meta-interpreter implementation that extends basic logic programming with additional reasoning capabilities. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation through test cases and analyze its compliance with both classical and probabilistic logic programming principles.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned the expected results with probability 1.0000:
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 1.0000
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 1.0000
- `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 1.0000
- `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` = 1.0000
- `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` = 1.0000

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All expansion predicates were correctly defined:
1. `implies/2` correctly implements logical implication (P→Q ≡ ¬P∨Q)
2. `opposite/1` correctly implements negation as failure
3. `expand/2` correctly handles arithmetic expansion
4. `includes/2` correctly implements list membership
5. `extend/3` correctly implements list prepend operation
6. `refute/1` correctly implements negation

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog scenarios:
- Logical correctness is maintained through proper implementation of logical operations
- Recursive termination is ensured in all recursive predicates (member/2, ancestor/2)
- Probabilistic rules are correctly handled:
  - Negation: P(¬A) = 1−P(A) via `opposite/1` and `refute/1`
  - Implication: P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)+P(A∧B) via `implies/2`

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation (no neural network integration).

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Properly handles standard logic programming constructs
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Correctly implements probabilistic operations
3. **Neural network integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used)

Edge cases considered:
- Undefined `expand/2` rules would fail gracefully
- Non-list inputs to list operations would fail (type-safe)
- Recursive depth is managed through proper base cases

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation demonstrates robust handling of both classical and probabilistic logic programming scenarios. All test cases pass successfully, and the meta-interpreter correctly implements the specified logical operations. The code follows ProbLog conventions and maintains logical soundness throughout all operations.
