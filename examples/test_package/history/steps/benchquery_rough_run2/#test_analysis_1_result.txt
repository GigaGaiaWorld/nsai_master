# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program uses population and area data to calculate densities and find matching pairs.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with the error: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'density/2' at 10:56`. The main query `query_pop/1` cannot execute because the required helper predicate `density/2` is not defined in the code.

## Failure Localization
- **Failed Query**: `query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2])`
- **Error Location**: The entire query fails because the supporting predicate `density/2` is missing (required by line 1 of the query definition)
- **Expected Behavior**: The program should calculate population densities first before comparing them
- **Actual Result**: Immediate failure due to undefined predicate

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issue is a missing predicate definition. The program requires:
1. A `density/2` predicate to calculate density (population/area)
2. Proper arithmetic operations to compute the density ratio
3. Comparison logic for the 5% threshold

In classical ProbLog terms, the program fails basic predicate existence checking before any probabilistic reasoning can occur. The current implementation shows no probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- ❌ Not met - Missing critical density calculation functionality
- ❌ No probabilistic reasoning implemented
- ❌ DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Not Handled**:
- Missing countries in either population or area data
- Division by zero if area is 0
- Non-numeric data handling
- Case where no countries meet the 5% threshold

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `density/2` predicate | Complete failure | Add density calculation: `density(C, D) :- pop(C, P), area(C, A), D is P/A.` |
| 2 | No error handling for missing data | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for population/area existence |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical Prolog | Consider adding uncertainty to population figures |

**Corrected Code Block**:
```prolog
density(Country, Density) :- 
    pop(Country, Pop), 
    area(Country, Area), 
    Density is Pop/Area.

query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :- 
    density(Country1, Density1), 
    density(Country2, Density2), 
    Country1 @< Country2, 
    abs(Density1 - Density2) =< (0.05 * max(Density1, Density2)).
```

The program requires the addition of the `density/2` predicate to become functional. After this fix, it should properly compare population densities between country pairs. The current implementation remains purely deterministic without probabilistic elements or neural network integration.
