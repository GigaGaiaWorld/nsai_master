# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Problog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program calculates population density from given population and area facts, then finds country pairs meeting the density similarity criterion.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful queries:
1. `query_pop([china, 2.440828402366864, france, 2.464788732394366]) = 1.0000`
2. `query_pop([indonesia, 2.23859649122807, pakistan, 2.192926045016077]) = 1.0000`
3. `query_pop([italy, 4.775862068965517, philippines, 4.611111111111111]) = 1.0000`
4. `query_pop([ethiopia, 0.777142857142857, mexico, 0.760471204188482]) = 1.0000`

**All tests passed (no failures)** - All queries returned correct country pairs with density values within the specified 5% tolerance threshold.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly:
- Calculates density via `density/2` predicate
- Compares country pairs with `Country1 @< Country2` to avoid duplicates
- Implements the 5% tolerance check with `abs(Density1 - Density2) =< (0.05 * max(Density1, Density2))`

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical Problog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The program correctly implements the required logic for density calculation and comparison
2. **Termination**: The program terminates properly as there are no recursive predicates
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: All results show probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic facts and successful queries
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration was used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

Key calculations verified:
- Density ratios match population/area values
- 5% tolerance is correctly implemented (e.g., for China/France: |2.4408-2.4648| ≤ 0.05*2.4648 → 0.024 ≤ 0.123)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for density calculation and comparison
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not heavily utilized (only deterministic facts)
- Neural integration: Not required/used

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. Country pair ordering enforced by `@<` prevents duplicate pairs
2. Density calculation handles all provided country facts
3. Floating-point comparison works within specified tolerance

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Could add input validation for non-existent countries
2. Might benefit from rounding density values for readability
3. Could optimize by pre-calculating all densities

## Error Summary

| 2 | N/A | N/A | Consider adding input validation |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Rounding density values might improve readability |
