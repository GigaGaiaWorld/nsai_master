</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of constraints involving nationalities, colors, pets, drinks, and cigarettes. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly satisfied.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with a single query:
```prolog
query(zebra(Houses)).
```

**Result:**
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as evidenced by the complete and consistent house arrangement returned with probability 1.0.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The main `zebra/1` predicate correctly encodes all puzzle constraints
   - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) properly terminate
   - All constraints are satisfied in the returned solution

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The solution returns with probability 1.0, indicating certainty
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this classical implementation
   - DeepProbLog features were not used (no neural network integration)

3. **Constraint Satisfaction:**
   - All positional constraints (right_of, next_to) are correctly implemented
   - All property constraints (color, nationality, pet, drink, cigarette) are properly checked

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - Classical reasoning: Fully met (all constraints correctly implemented)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (classical Prolog solution)
   - Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

2. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - List boundaries handled correctly in recursive predicates
   - All possible house positions are checked
   - No undefined predicates or infinite recursion risks

3. **Code Quality:**
   - Clear predicate definitions
   - Proper use of helper predicates
   - Readable house representation

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation successfully solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints satisfied. No errors or warnings were detected during evaluation. The solution demonstrates proper use of Prolog's logical programming paradigm to solve constraint satisfaction problems.

**Word Count:** 398

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
