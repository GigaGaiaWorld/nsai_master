# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of constraints involving nationalities, colors, pets, drinks, and cigarettes. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly satisfied.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with a single query:
```prolog
query(zebra(Houses)).
```

**Result:**
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as evidenced by the complete and consistent house arrangement returned with probability 1.0.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The main `zebra/1` predicate correctly encodes all puzzle constraints
   - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) properly terminate
   - All constraints are satisfied in the returned solution

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The solution returns with probability 1.0, indicating certainty
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this classical implementation
   - DeepProbLog features were not used (no neural network integration)

3. **Constraint Satisfaction:**
   - All positional constraints (right_of, next_to) are correctly implemented
   - All property constraints (color, nationality, pet, drink, cigarette) are properly checked

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - Classical reasoning: Fully met (all constraints correctly implemented)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (classical Prolog solution)
   - Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

2. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - List boundaries handled correctly in recursive predicates
   - All possible house positions are checked
   - No undefined predicates or infinite recursion risks

3. **Code Quality:**
   - Clear predicate definitions
   - Proper use of helper predicates
   - Readable house representation

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation successfully solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints satisfied. No errors or warnings were detected during evaluation. The solution demonstrates proper use of Prolog's logical programming paradigm to solve constraint satisfaction problems.
