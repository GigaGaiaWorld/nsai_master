# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that includes:
1. Basic move definitions (rock, paper, scissor)
2. Win-lose relationships between moves
3. Game result calculation
4. Score computation
5. Winner determination

The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation through test case analysis and identify any potential issues.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Result:**
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
- Player 1 moves: [rock, rock, rock]
- Player 2 moves: [paper, paper, scissor]
- Expected results: [lose, lose, win]
- Score: -1 (lose=-1, win=+1, draw=0)
- Final winner: player2 (score < 0)

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly calculates game results and determines the winner based on the scoring system.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. All predicates function as expected:
1. `move/1` correctly defines valid moves
2. `beats/2` correctly implements game rules
3. `result/3` properly determines round outcomes
4. `play/3` correctly processes move lists
5. `compute_score/2` accurately calculates the final score
6. `determine_winner/3` properly interprets the score

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior in both classical and probabilistic aspects:

1. **Classical Prolog Analysis:**
   - All predicates have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - Termination is guaranteed as lists are processed element-by-element
   - No infinite recursion risks

2. **Probabilistic Analysis:**
   - The test shows deterministic results (probability 1.0000)
   - No probabilistic facts are used in this implementation
   - The rules correctly handle all possible game outcomes

3. **DeepProbLog Analysis:**
   - DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are not used in this implementation
   - Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used"

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning about the rock-paper-scissors game:

1. **Strengths:**
   - Clear and concise rule definitions
   - Proper handling of all game scenarios (win/lose/draw)
   - Correct recursive processing of move lists
   - Accurate score calculation

2. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - Empty move lists are handled (`play([],[],[])`)
   - All move combinations are covered by `beats/2`
   - Score calculation handles all result types (win/lose/draw)

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - Add input validation for move lists
   - Consider adding probabilistic moves for more complex scenarios
   - Could include tie-breaking rules for tournament play

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | N/A |

The implementation is correct and handles all specified requirements for the rock-paper-scissors game scenario. No errors or improvements were identified beyond potential feature enhancements.
