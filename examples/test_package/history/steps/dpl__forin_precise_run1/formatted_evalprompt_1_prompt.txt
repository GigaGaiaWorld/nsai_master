</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, recursive termination, and proper handling of edge cases.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
Result:
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly:
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (requirement 1)
2. Inserts the head element into the sorted list (requirement 2)

The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) and recursive case both function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical Prolog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm properly implements insertion sort logic by:
   - Breaking down the list (head and tail)
   - Recursively sorting the tail
   - Inserting the head in the correct position

2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates when the empty list is reached (base case).

In probabilistic terms:
- The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior (no probabilistic facts involved)
- No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure deterministic implementation)
- Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

**Edge Case Considerations**:
1. Empty list: Handled by base case
2. Single-element list: Would work through base case and insertion
3. Non-list input: Would fail (no explicit type checking)
4. Performance: O(n²) time complexity as expected for insertion sort

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |
| 2 | No type checking | May fail on non-list input | Add input validation |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to deterministic sorting | Could extend with probabilistic comparisons |

**Word count**: 398

The implementation correctly performs insertion sort in Prolog with proper recursive structure and base case handling. While it meets all specified requirements, future improvements could include input validation and potential probabilistic extensions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
