# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, recursive termination, and proper handling of edge cases.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
Result:
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly:
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (requirement 1)
2. Inserts the head element into the sorted list (requirement 2)

The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) and recursive case both function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical Prolog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm properly implements insertion sort logic by:
   - Breaking down the list (head and tail)
   - Recursively sorting the tail
   - Inserting the head in the correct position

2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates when the empty list is reached (base case).

In probabilistic terms:
- The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior (no probabilistic facts involved)
- No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure deterministic implementation)
- Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

**Edge Case Considerations**:
1. Empty list: Handled by base case
2. Single-element list: Would work through base case and insertion
3. Non-list input: Would fail (no explicit type checking)
4. Performance: O(nÂ²) time complexity as expected for insertion sort

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |
| 2 | No type checking | May fail on non-list input | Add input validation |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to deterministic sorting | Could extend with probabilistic comparisons |

**Word count**: 398

The implementation correctly performs insertion sort in Prolog with proper recursive structure and base case handling. While it meets all specified requirements, future improvements could include input validation and potential probabilistic extensions.
