           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a given probability. The program should recursively count successful outcomes (heads) from multiple coin tosses and return the total count. The evaluation focuses on identifying errors, verifying logical correctness, and assessing probabilistic reasoning.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the recursive rule `coins_r/3` (lines 7-12) where the code attempts to use an implication operator (`->`) without proper syntax. The specific issues are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The implication operator is not properly formatted in the ProbLog context
2. **Missing Probabilistic Fact**: The `coin/1` predicate is defined but not properly integrated in the recursive counting logic

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` is correctly defined
   - The recursive case contains malformed syntax for probabilistic condition checking
   - The termination condition (`CNT > 0`) is properly implemented

2. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - The probability declaration `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is incomplete
   - The implication operation is not properly implemented for probabilistic reasoning
   - The probability calculation chain is broken due to syntax errors

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration present)

## Overall Analysis
The program fails to meet its functional requirements due to syntax errors in the probabilistic reasoning implementation. Key issues include:

1. **Classical Reasoning**:
   - The recursive structure is conceptually correct but syntactically invalid
   - Edge cases (CNT=0) are properly handled

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
   - The probability propagation through recursion is not properly implemented
   - The coin toss probability (0.8) is defined but not correctly utilized

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Negative CNT values are not handled
   - The probability declaration syntax is incomplete
   - The implication operation needs proper ProbLog syntax

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed implication syntax | Program cannot execute | Use proper ProbLog conditional syntax |
| 2 | Incomplete probability declaration | Probabilities not properly initialized | Complete the PH::make_coin declaration |
| 3 | Missing probabilistic integration | Counting logic doesn't use probabilities | Implement proper probabilistic counting |
| 4 | No negative CNT handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |

**Recommendation**: Rewrite the recursive counting logic using proper ProbLog syntax for probabilistic conditions, complete the probability declarations, and add input validation for edge cases. The corrected version should use explicit probabilistic predicates rather than Prolog's implication operator.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
