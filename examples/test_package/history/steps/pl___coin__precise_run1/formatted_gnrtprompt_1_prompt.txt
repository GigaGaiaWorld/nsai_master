System: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. You could use the available tools to complete the task. You should always use 'get_report_tool' first to gain more information.
Human: Your task is to regenerate the code in each <langda> block inside <Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_format>
PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: A88642CF </HASH>
<Requirements>With the counter CNT decreasing to 0, each step:
 If the CNTth coin coin(CNT) turns up heads, the success count SC increases by 1;
 Otherwise, it remains unchanged;
 Finally, all steps are accumulated to S. </Requirements></Langda>
.
total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).
<Regenerate_format>

<Regenerate_Instructions>
1. In <Regenerate_format> you will see the code template format to be followed, and the <langda> block in the template marks the part that needs to be completed.
2. Your task is to generate and output the complete Problog/DeepProbLog code according to the user's specific requirements for each <langda> block. The new code should fix the error in previous code.
</Regenerate_Instructions>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed code here
```
</Final_Answer>


AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: A88642CF </HASH>
<Requirements>With the counter CNT decreasing to 0, each step:
 If the CNTth coin coin(CNT) turns up heads, the success count SC increases by 1;
 Otherwise, it remains unchanged;
 Finally, all steps are accumulated to S. </Requirements></Langda>
.
total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).

coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).

total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).

<generated_code>
<Final_Answer> 
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
