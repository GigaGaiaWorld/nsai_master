           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Analysis Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with probabilistic outcomes. The program attempts to count successful outcomes (heads) from multiple coin tosses, where each coin has an 80% probability of landing heads. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and recursive implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate (lines 7-12) where the code attempts to use an implication operator (`->`) without proper syntax. The specific issues are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The implication operator is not properly formatted in the ProbLog context
2. **Missing Probabilistic Fact Definition**: The `coin/1` predicate's probabilistic nature isn't correctly expressed
3. **Base Case Issue**: The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0).` may not properly terminate the recursion

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The recursive counting logic is conceptually correct but syntactically invalid in ProbLog
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The program fails to properly define the probabilistic nature of the coin tosses
3. **Termination**: While the base case exists, the recursive case's syntax prevents proper evaluation
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is present ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## Overall Analysis
The program fails to meet its functional requirements due to:
1. Incorrect ProbLog syntax for conditional probability
2. Improper handling of probabilistic facts
3. Syntax errors in the recursive counting mechanism

Edge cases not properly handled:
- Negative count values
- Non-integer count values
- Multiple coin definitions
- Proper probability distribution validation

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid implication syntax | Prevents execution | Use proper ProbLog conditional probability syntax |
| 2 | Undefined probabilistic fact | No actual probability calculation | Define coin/1 as proper probabilistic fact |
| 3 | Base case ambiguity | Potential termination issues | Make base case more explicit |
| 4 | Missing probability validation | Potential invalid distributions | Add probability range checks |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```problog
% Proper probabilistic fact definition
0.8::coin_heads(_).

% Recursive counting
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin_heads(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).

total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).
```

The corrected version properly defines the probabilistic fact and uses valid ProbLog syntax for conditional probability handling. This should properly count the number of successful coin tosses in 4 attempts with each having an 80% chance of success.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
