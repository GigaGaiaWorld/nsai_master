</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates the implementation of a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, focusing on its logical correctness, recursive structure, and test case verification. The analysis covers both classical Prolog functionality and potential probabilistic aspects (though none are present in this implementation).

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case demonstrates the following result:
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with complete certainty (probability 1.0).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. Comparison operations during merging

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly implemented
   - The recursive case properly splits, sorts, and merges sublists
   - The `merge/3` predicate correctly handles element comparison and list merging

2. **Recursive Termination**:
   - The recursion terminates because each recursive call operates on a strictly smaller sublist (split at half length)
   - The base cases ensure termination for lists of length 0 or 1

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - All results have probability 1.0, indicating deterministic behavior

### DeepProbLog Analysis
- **DeepProbLog feature not used**: The implementation contains no neural network calls (`nn/3`) or tensor operations.

## Overall Analysis
### Functional Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**:
   - Fully implemented and correct merge sort algorithm
   - Proper handling of recursive cases and base cases

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
   - Not applicable in this implementation

3. **Neural Network Integration**:
   - Not used in this implementation

### Edge Case Considerations
1. **Non-list input**: The code doesn't explicitly handle non-list inputs (would fail with type error)
2. **Performance**: Deep recursion could be problematic for very large lists
3. **Duplicate elements**: Correctly handled (merge predicate uses `=<` and `>`)
4. **Empty list**: Explicitly handled by first clause

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and passes all provided test cases. For production use, consider adding input validation for non-list cases and potentially optimizing for very large lists.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
