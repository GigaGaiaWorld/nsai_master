</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Analysis Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to recognize digits and operations, then evaluates expressions through recursive parsing with `almost_equal/2` for floating-point comparison.

## Test Results Summary
The test case `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` failed with a CallModeError. The error occurs when trying to evaluate the expression "2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7" due to non-ground arguments in the `almost_equal` comparison.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `parse/2` predicate (lines 24-25 in the code block) when processing nested arithmetic operations. Specifically:
- The error message indicates `almost_equal(R, N1 / R2)` fails because `abs(X1-2*7.0)` is not ground when the comparison is attempted
- The issue stems from attempting to compare non-ground variables in the arithmetic evaluation

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The parser's recursive design is logically sound but fails to handle operation precedence correctly (no parentheses support) and has floating-point comparison issues.
2. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.
3. **DeepProbLog Integration**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`) or tensor operations are present ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
4. **Termination**: The recursion is well-formed and terminates properly for valid inputs.

Key issues identified:
- The `almost_equal/2` predicate requires ground terms for comparison but receives uninstantiated variables during expression evaluation
- No handling of operator precedence (current implementation evaluates strictly left-to-right)
- No error handling for division by zero cases

## Overall Analysis
The implementation partially meets classical reasoning requirements but fails on nested expressions. Key observations:

1. **Strengths**:
- Clear separation of detection and evaluation phases
- Proper recursive design for expression parsing
- Floating-point comparison handling via `almost_equal`

2. **Weaknesses**:
- No operator precedence handling
- Insufficient error handling
- Floating-point comparison implementation issues

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
- Division by zero
- Invalid operator sequences
- Non-list inputs
- Empty lists
- Single operator cases

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground comparison in almost_equal | Evaluation fails for nested expressions | Restructure evaluation to ensure ground terms before comparison |
| 2 | No operator precedence | Incorrect evaluation order | Implement proper precedence handling or parenthesized expressions |
| 3 | No division by zero check | Potential runtime error | Add validation before division operations |
| 4 | Strict left-to-right evaluation | Mathematically incorrect results | Implement proper arithmetic precedence rules |

## Recommendations
1. Modify `almost_equal/2` to handle non-ground cases or restructure the evaluation order
2. Implement operator precedence rules (PEMDAS)
3. Add input validation and error handling
4. Consider adding probabilistic aspects if needed for the application
5. Add test cases for edge scenarios (empty lists, invalid sequences, etc.)

The implementation shows good structure but requires fixes to the evaluation mechanism and additional robustness features to handle real-world arithmetic expressions correctly.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
