# Problog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code attempts to solve the puzzle by defining constraints on house attributes (nationality, pet, color, drink, and cigarette) across 5 adjacent houses. The purpose is to verify logical correctness and identify any implementation errors.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: The entire `zebra(Houses)` query failed to execute
2. **Error Location**: Line 4 (beginning of constraints section)
3. **Root Cause**: The code uses `member/2` predicate but doesn't provide its implementation, while having a custom `my_member/2` defined but unused

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - Missing implementation of `member/2` while being called in constraints
   - Custom `my_member/2` is defined but never used
   - The water-drinking constraint has an extra argument (`house(_, _, _, water, _, _)` should be `house(_, _, _, water, _)`)

2. **ProbLog Specifics**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

3. **Logical Structure**:
   - The puzzle constraints are correctly translated from requirements
   - The house structure and helper predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) are properly defined

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct structure but implementation error)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined predicate usage (`member/2`)
   - Custom predicate not utilized (`my_member/2`)
   - Argument count mismatch in water constraint

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure | Replace with `my_member/2` or implement `member/2` |
| 2 | Unused `my_member/2` predicate | Code redundancy | Remove or utilize consistently |
| 3 | Extra argument in water constraint | Potential runtime error | Fix to `house(_, _, _, water, _)` |
| 4 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical Prolog | Consider adding probabilistic facts if needed |

```prolog
% Suggested Fixes:
% 1. Replace all member/2 calls with my_member/2
% 2. Fix water constraint:
member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)
% 3. Remove unused my_member/2 or implement member/2 properly
```

The implementation is conceptually correct but fails due to basic predicate implementation issues. With the suggested fixes, it should correctly solve the Zebra Puzzle using pure logical constraints. The solution currently doesn't utilize any ProbLog-specific features, operating as a standard Prolog program.
