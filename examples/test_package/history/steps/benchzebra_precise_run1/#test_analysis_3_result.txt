# Zebra Puzzle Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and identify any failures in meeting the puzzle's requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
zebra(X2) = 0.0000
```
This indicates the query `zebra(Houses)` failed to find any valid solution (probability 0.0). This is unexpected as the puzzle should have exactly one valid solution.

## Failure Localization
The main failure occurs in the top-level `zebra(Houses)` predicate. The system failed to find any valid house arrangement that satisfies all constraints. Key problematic areas include:

1. Line with `my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _, _), Houses)` - This contains an extra argument (6 instead of 5)
2. Potential inconsistency in the constraints that prevents any valid solution from being found

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues identified are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The water-drinking constraint has an extra argument (`_`) making it incompatible with the house structure
2. **Logical Constraints**: The combination of constraints may be too restrictive due to:
   - Potential circular dependencies in house positioning
   - Overlapping constraints that cannot be simultaneously satisfied
3. **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and should terminate properly

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet the functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: The puzzle constraints are not correctly implemented (water constraint syntax error)
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this purely logical puzzle
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases not properly handled:
- Invalid house structure (wrong number of arguments)
- Impossible constraint combinations
- Non-list input to house predicates

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Extra argument in water constraint | Prevents any solution | Fix to `house(_, _, _, water, _)` |
| 2 | Potentially conflicting constraints | May prevent valid solutions | Verify constraint logic |
| 3 | No solution found | Query returns 0 probability | Debug constraint satisfaction |

```prolog
% Corrected water constraint should be:
my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)
```

The implementation requires careful review of all constraints and their interactions to ensure the puzzle can be solved. The current version fails to find any valid solution due to both syntactic and potential logical issues.
