# Problog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Problog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code attempts to solve the puzzle by defining constraints on house attributes (color, nationality, pet, drink, cigarette) across 5 adjacent houses. The purpose is to verify logical correctness and identify any implementation errors.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: The entire `zebra(Houses)` query fails to execute
2. **Error Location**: Line 4 (beginning of constraints)
3. **Root Cause**: The code uses `member/2` predicate but doesn't provide its implementation, while later defining a similar `my_member/2` that isn't used

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - Missing `member/2` implementation (standard list membership predicate)
   - Defined `my_member/2` is correct but unused
   - All other helper predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) are correctly implemented
   - The puzzle constraints appear logically correct but can't be tested due to the missing predicate

2. **ProbLog Specifics**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used (pure logical program)
   - DeepProbLog feature not used
   - No probability calculations needed for this classical puzzle

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct structure but missing predicate)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Missing standard predicate (`member/2`) is critical
   - List structure is properly handled in helper predicates
   - Recursion depth is fixed (5 houses) so no performance issues

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `member/2` implementation | Complete failure | Replace with `my_member/2` or add `member/2` definition |
| 2 | Unused `my_member/2` predicate | Dead code | Either use it or remove it |

**Recommendation**: Replace all `member/2` calls with `my_member/2` since you already have a correct implementation, or add this at the beginning:
```prolog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
```

The core logic appears sound - this is purely an implementation oversight regarding a basic predicate. The puzzle constraints follow the classic Zebra Puzzle requirements correctly in the visible code structure.
