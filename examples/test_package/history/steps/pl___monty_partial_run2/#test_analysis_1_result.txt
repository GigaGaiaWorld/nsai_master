# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant chooses between three doors with one containing a prize. The host then opens a non-prize door, and the contestant must decide whether to keep their original choice or switch. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning implementation and ensure correct behavior for both "keep" and "switch" strategies.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All test results match the expected probabilities for the Monty Hall problem:
- Equal 1/3 probability for prize behind each door
- Certain selection of door 1
- 1/3 chance to win by keeping original choice
- 2/3 chance to win by switching

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly models the probabilistic behavior of both game strategies.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Random prize placement (lines 1-2)
2. Door selection (line 3)
3. Host behavior when both remaining doors are empty (lines 5-8)
4. Host behavior when one remaining door has prize (lines 10-13)
5. Win conditions for both strategies (lines 15-20)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically correct:
1. Prize distribution: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for each door (lines 1-2)
2. Host behavior probabilities:
   - When both alternatives are empty: random 50/50 choice (lines 5-8)
   - When one alternative has prize: deterministic choice of empty door (lines 10-13)
3. Win probabilities:
   - `P(win_keep) = P(prize(selected)) = 1/3` (line 15)
   - `P(win_switch) = 1 - P(win_keep) = 2/3` (lines 17-20)

The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
- `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` through negation as failure
- No implications used that would require `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct use of negation and member predicates
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper distribution of probabilities
- **Edge cases**: Handles all door selection and prize placement combinations
- **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (no neural network integration)

Potential edge cases already handled:
- Non-list input: Not possible due to hardcoded lists
- Deep recursion: Not applicable with fixed 3-door scenario
- Undefined cases: All possible game states covered

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | Implementation correct |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic behavior for both game strategies, passing all test cases without any failures or edge case issues.
