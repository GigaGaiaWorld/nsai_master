</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, implements move comparison logic, and includes a scoring system to determine the winner of a series of moves. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and analyze its behavior under test conditions.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
With result:
```
determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The result correctly shows player2 as the winner with probability 1.0, which matches expected behavior:
- First two rounds: paper beats rock (player2 wins twice)
- Third round: rock beats scissor (player1 wins once)
- Final score: -1 (1 win for player1, 2 wins for player2)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Move comparison through `beats/2` predicates (lines 4-6)
2. Game result calculation in `play/3` (lines 10-16)
3. Score computation in `compute_score/2` (lines 18-21)
4. Winner determination in `determine_winner/3` (lines 22-26)

## Root Cause Analysis
The classical Problog implementation shows correct logical behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All game rules are properly encoded in the `beats/2` facts
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: Since no probabilistic facts are used, standard logical evaluation applies
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is used (report: "DeepProbLog feature not used")

The implementation correctly handles:
- Win/lose/draw conditions through exhaustive pattern matching
- Score accumulation through tail recursion
- Final winner determination through score comparison

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
1. Correctly implements rock-paper-scissors game rules
2. Properly evaluates sequences of moves
3. Accurately computes final scores and determines winners

Edge cases considered:
- Empty move lists are handled by the base case
- All possible move combinations are covered by `beats/2`
- Draw conditions are explicitly checked

Potential improvements:
1. Could add input validation for move types
2. Might consider adding probabilistic moves for varied gameplay
3. Could optimize with accumulator-style recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Consider adding input validation |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Could extend with probabilistic moves |

The implementation is logically sound and passes all test cases. The code is well-structured and properly handles the rock-paper-scissors game mechanics. No errors were found in the current implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
