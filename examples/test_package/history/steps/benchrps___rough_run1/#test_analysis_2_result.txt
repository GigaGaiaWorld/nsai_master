# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, implements move comparison logic, and includes a scoring system to determine the winner of a series of moves. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and analyze its behavior under test conditions.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
With result:
```
determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The result correctly shows player2 as the winner with probability 1.0, which matches expected behavior:
- First two rounds: paper beats rock (player2 wins twice)
- Third round: rock beats scissor (player1 wins once)
- Final score: -1 (1 win for player1, 2 wins for player2)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Move comparison through `beats/2` predicates (lines 4-6)
2. Game result calculation in `play/3` (lines 10-16)
3. Score computation in `compute_score/2` (lines 18-21)
4. Winner determination in `determine_winner/3` (lines 22-26)

## Root Cause Analysis
The classical Problog implementation shows correct logical behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All game rules are properly encoded in the `beats/2` facts
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: Since no probabilistic facts are used, standard logical evaluation applies
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is used (report: "DeepProbLog feature not used")

The implementation correctly handles:
- Win/lose/draw conditions through exhaustive pattern matching
- Score accumulation through tail recursion
- Final winner determination through score comparison

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
1. Correctly implements rock-paper-scissors game rules
2. Properly evaluates sequences of moves
3. Accurately computes final scores and determines winners

Edge cases considered:
- Empty move lists are handled by the base case
- All possible move combinations are covered by `beats/2`
- Draw conditions are explicitly checked

Potential improvements:
1. Could add input validation for move types
2. Might consider adding probabilistic moves for varied gameplay
3. Could optimize with accumulator-style recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Consider adding input validation |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Could extend with probabilistic moves |

The implementation is logically sound and passes all test cases. The code is well-structured and properly handles the rock-paper-scissors game mechanics. No errors were found in the current implementation.
