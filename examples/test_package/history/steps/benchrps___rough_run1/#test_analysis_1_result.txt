# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Problog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, implements move comparison logic, and includes functionality to determine the winner of a series of moves. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and identify any issues in the logic or syntax.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided (`determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`) failed with an error message indicating an unknown clause for `->/2` at line 17:20. No successful test results were reported.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `play/3` predicate (lines 7-12) where the conditional operator `->` is used. The specific error message indicates Problog cannot find clauses for the implication operator `->/2`.

**Problematic Code Block:**
```prolog
play([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-
    (beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win;
     beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose;
     Result = draw),
    play(P1s, P2s, Results).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Issue**: Problog has limited support for Prolog's conditional operator `->`. The error suggests this operator isn't properly recognized in the current context.
2. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic (comparing moves and determining results) is correct for rock-paper-scissors, but the implementation syntax is incompatible with Problog.
3. **Recursive Termination**: The base case `play([], [], [])` is correctly defined, ensuring proper termination.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core logic is correct but syntax incompatible)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized
   - Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs aren't handled
   - Unequal length move lists would cause failure
   - The current error prevents any execution

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported conditional operator `->` | Complete failure | Replace with `if_then_else/3` or nested predicates |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | Limited functionality | Add probabilistic move selection if desired |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for move lists |

**Recommended Fix:**
```prolog
play([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-
    beats(P1, P2), Result = win, play(P1s, P2s, Results).
play([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-
    beats(P2, P1), Result = lose, play(P1s, P2s, Results).
play([P1|P1s], [P2|P2s], [Result|Results]) :-
    \+ beats(P1, P2), \+ beats(P2, P1), Result = draw, play(P1s, P2s, Results).
```

This implementation avoids the problematic conditional operator while maintaining the same logical behavior. The word count of this report is approximately 450 words.
