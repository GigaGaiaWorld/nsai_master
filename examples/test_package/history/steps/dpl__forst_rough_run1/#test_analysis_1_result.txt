# Code Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in Problog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of stack operations including `sort`, `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The code was tested with various stack operations to verify correctness and functionality.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned a probability of 0.0000, indicating complete failure:
```
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Missing Operations**: The code only implements `sort` operation (lines 1-9) but tests other unimplemented operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`).
2. **Operation Mismatch**: The test queries check for operations that have no corresponding implementation in the code.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Problog Analysis**:
   - The implemented `sort` operation is logically correct for its limited scope (sorting top 3 elements)
   - Recursive termination is properly handled in the `insertion_sort` predicate
   - Missing implementations for other stack operations cause all test queries to fail

2. **Probabilistic Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The 0.0000 results correctly reflect the impossibility of the queries given the current implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Fulfillment**:
   - Basic stack `sort` operation is implemented correctly
   - Other required operations are missing entirely
   - No probabilistic or neural network components were used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling for empty stacks or stacks with fewer than 3 elements in sort operation
   - No type checking for non-list inputs
   - No performance considerations for large stacks

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing stack operations | All non-sort tests fail | Implement all required stack operations |
| 2 | No error handling | May crash on edge cases | Add input validation and edge case handling |
| 3 | Limited sort functionality | Only works for top 3 elements | Make number of sorted elements configurable |

**Word Count**: 398

The implementation currently fails all test cases because it only partially implements the required functionality. The core sorting logic appears correct, but the code needs to be expanded to handle all specified stack operations and edge cases.
