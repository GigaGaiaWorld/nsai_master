# Code Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of various stack operations including push, pop, duplicate, swap, over, rotation, and sorting. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against test cases and analyze its compliance with ProbLog semantics.

## Test Results Summary
All test cases passed successfully:
```
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],[1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 3, 1, 4]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All stack operation predicates function as intended:
- `push/3` (Line 1)
- `pop/3` (Line 2)
- `dup/3` (Line 3)
- `swap/3` (Line 4)
- `over/3` (Line 5)
- `rot/3` (Line 6)
- `sort/3` with supporting predicates (Lines 7-20)

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Aspects:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All predicates correctly implement their respective stack operations through pattern matching and list manipulation.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The `insertion_sort/2` predicate properly terminates as the base case handles empty lists (Line 16) and the recursive case reduces the problem size (Line 17).

### ProbLog Aspects:
1. **Probability Handling**: All operations correctly return probability 1.0, indicating deterministic behavior.
2. **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**: Since no probabilistic facts are used, the implementation doesn't violate any probabilistic rules.

**DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no neural network integration present)

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully implemented and correct
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correct but trivial (only deterministic cases)
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **Empty Stack**: Not tested for operations like pop/dup/swap that require non-empty stacks
2. **Insufficient Elements**: Not tested for operations requiring multiple elements (swap needs ≥2, rot needs ≥3)
3. **Non-list Input**: No type checking for stack parameter
4. **Sort Operation**: Only tested with fixed N=3 in the original code

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Untested edge cases | Potential runtime errors | Add tests for empty stack and insufficient elements |
| 2 | Hardcoded sort parameter | Inflexible implementation | Make N configurable in sort operation |
| 3 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking for stack parameter |

**Word Count**: 398

The implementation correctly handles all tested cases but would benefit from additional edge case testing and more flexible sorting functionality. The deterministic nature of the operations makes the probabilistic aspects trivial in this implementation.
