# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query Analysis

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates densities from population and area data, then finds country pairs where one density is slightly higher than another (within a 5% margin). The evaluation verifies correctness of the classical logic implementation and checks for proper handling of edge cases.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 successful query results:
```
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All returned country pairs correctly satisfy the density comparison condition (D1 > D2 and 20*D1 < 21*D2) as defined in the `query_pop` predicate.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The core predicates function as intended:
- `density/2` (Lines 10-13) correctly calculates population density
- `query_pop/1` (Lines 6-9) properly implements the comparison logic
- All population and area facts are correctly defined

## Root Cause Analysis
The classical Prolog implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior:
1. **Density Calculation**: `D is (P*100)//A` performs integer division to avoid floating-point inaccuracies
2. **Comparison Logic**: The 5% margin check (`T1 is 20*D1, T2 is 21*D2, T1 < T2`) correctly implements the requirement
3. **Termination**: The program terminates as it uses finite facts rather than recursive rules

Probabilistic aspects:
- The program uses classical Prolog without probabilistic facts or rules
- No DeepProbLog features (neural networks or tensors) are used
- All queries return probability 1.0000 indicating deterministic results

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning fully implemented for population density queries
- Probabilistic reasoning not required/implemented
- Neural network integration not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Integer division prevents floating-point comparison issues
2. All country data is complete (no missing population/area pairs)
3. The 5% margin handles approximate equality robustly

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Adding input validation for non-existent countries
2. Including more countries for comprehensive testing
3. Adding unit tests for edge cases (minimum/maximum density values)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly fulfills its requirements for finding countries with similar population densities. The test cases verify the core functionality works as intended, with no logical errors or edge case failures detected.
