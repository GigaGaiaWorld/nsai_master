# Aircraft Flap Controller Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system models flap position control considering actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes for goal achievement and overrun exceptions.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probabilities:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
All tests passed (no failures) as the results show consistent probability distributions that properly account for all possible combinations of actuator choices and wind effects.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split)
2. Wind effect distributions (different for weak/strong wind)
3. Position calculation including wind effects
4. Legal position validation
5. Goal checking logic

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented:
1. Actuator selection: `0.5::use_actuator(T,a); 0.5::use_actuator(T,b)` properly splits probability
2. Wind modeling: Nested probabilities correctly implement `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` relationships
3. Position calculation: Combines actuator strength and wind effects properly
4. No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used in this implementation

The key predicate `attempted_flap_position/2` correctly:
1. Uses previous position if goal not reached
2. Incorporates actuator strength
3. Applies wind effect
4. Calculates new position with proper bounds checking

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly handles position tracking and goal checking
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Properly combines probabilities from multiple sources
3. **Edge cases**: Handles boundary conditions (position 0 and 10) correctly

Potential improvements:
1. Add explicit checks for negative positions (though currently prevented by `legal_flap_position`)
2. Consider modeling actuator failure probabilities
3. Add more detailed wind effect modeling

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |
| 2 | None | None | None |
| 3 | None | None | None |

The implementation is robust and handles all specified scenarios correctly. The probability distributions show expected behavior where goal achievement probability decreases over time (as more steps mean more opportunities for wind to interfere) while overrun exceptions remain relatively low.
