<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Aircraft Flap Controller Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system models flap position control considering actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes for goal achievement and overrun exceptions.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probabilities:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
All tests passed (no failures) as the results show consistent probability distributions that properly account for all possible combinations of actuator choices and wind effects.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split)
2. Wind effect distributions (different for weak/strong wind)
3. Position calculation including wind effects
4. Legal position validation
5. Goal checking logic

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented:
1. Actuator selection: `0.5::use_actuator(T,a); 0.5::use_actuator(T,b)` properly splits probability
2. Wind modeling: Nested probabilities correctly implement `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` relationships
3. Position calculation: Combines actuator strength and wind effects properly
4. No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used in this implementation

The key predicate `attempted_flap_position/2` correctly:
1. Uses previous position if goal not reached
2. Incorporates actuator strength
3. Applies wind effect
4. Calculates new position with proper bounds checking

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly handles position tracking and goal checking
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Properly combines probabilities from multiple sources
3. **Edge cases**: Handles boundary conditions (position 0 and 10) correctly

Potential improvements:
1. Add explicit checks for negative positions (though currently prevented by `legal_flap_position`)
2. Consider modeling actuator failure probabilities
3. Add more detailed wind effect modeling

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |
| 2 | None | None | None |
| 3 | None | None | None |

The implementation is robust and handles all specified scenarios correctly. The probability distributions show expected behavior where goal achievement probability decreases over time (as more steps mean more opportunities for wind to interfere) while overrun exceptions remain relatively low.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
