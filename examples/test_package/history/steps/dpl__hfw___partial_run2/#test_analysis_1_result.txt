# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Number Detection and Expression Evaluation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to:
1. Detect numbers (0-9) from image representations
2. Detect mathematical operators (+, -, *, /)
3. Parse and evaluate mathematical expressions from sequences of detected numbers and operators

The system uses classical Prolog-style reasoning with some probabilistic capabilities (as evidenced by probability values in results).

## Test Results Summary
The system was tested with one main query:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:**
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],-10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
The expression being evaluated is `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` which mathematically equals:
1. Parentheses first: 3 + 3 = 6
2. Division: 2 / 6 ≈ 0.333...
3. Multiplication: 2 * 7 = 14
4. Subtraction: 0.333... - 14 ≈ -13.666...

However, the system returned -10.333..., which indicates a miscalculation.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the parsing of subtraction operations. The current implementation:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse([-1, *|T], R2),
 almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
```
incorrectly transforms subtraction into a multiplication by -1 and addition, which doesn't maintain the correct operator precedence.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error**: The subtraction handling doesn't properly account for operator precedence in the expression.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion is properly structured and terminates correctly.
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: All facts have probability 1.0, so no probabilistic reasoning is involved in this case.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (fails on complex expressions)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (all facts are deterministic)
   - Neural network integration: Not present

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Division by zero is properly handled
   - Single-number expressions work correctly
   - Operator precedence needs improvement
   - Non-list inputs would likely cause errors

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect subtraction handling | Wrong calculation results | Rewrite subtraction to maintain proper precedence |
| 2 | No probabilistic facts used | Limited probabilistic reasoning | Consider adding probabilistic number detection |
| 3 | No neural integration | Limited image processing capability | Consider adding nn/3 predicates for actual image processing |

**Recommendations:**
1. Correct the subtraction handling to maintain proper operator precedence:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    almost_equal(N1 - R2, R).
```
2. Consider adding probabilistic aspects if image detection should be uncertain
3. For actual image processing, integrate DeepProbLog's neural predicates

The system currently works for simple expressions but fails on more complex ones due to operator precedence issues in the parsing implementation.
