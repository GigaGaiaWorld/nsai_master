# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Number Detection and Expression Evaluation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to:
1. Detect numbers (0-9) from image identifiers
2. Detect mathematical operators from image identifiers
3. Parse and evaluate mathematical expressions composed of these detected elements

The system uses classical Problog reasoning without probabilistic elements or DeepProbLog neural network integration.

## Test Results Summary
The system was tested with one main query:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:**
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],-10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
The expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` evaluates to:
1. Parentheses first: 3 + 3 = 6
2. Division: 2 / 6 ≈ 0.333...
3. Multiplication: 2 * 7 = 14
4. Final subtraction: 0.333... - 14 ≈ -13.666...

**Discrepancy Found:**
The system returned -10.333... instead of the expected -13.666..., indicating a calculation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the expression evaluation chain, specifically in the handling of subtraction. The problematic rule is:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse([-1, *|T], R2),
 almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
```

This incorrectly transforms `a - b` into `a + (-1 * b)` but then adds it rather than subtracting, causing the miscalculation.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error**: The subtraction rule adds the negated term instead of subtracting it
2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion works correctly, terminating properly on single-number lists
3. **Probabilistic Elements**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is present ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (fails on subtraction)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Division by zero is properly handled
   - Non-list inputs would fail gracefully
   - Deep recursion could be problematic for very long expressions
   - Floating point comparison works correctly via `almost_equal/2`

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect subtraction handling | Wrong calculation results | Fix subtraction rule to properly subtract terms |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Limited functionality | Consider adding uncertainty handling |
| 3 | No neural integration | Static detection only | Could integrate nn/3 for image recognition |

**Recommended Fix:**
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse(T, R2),
 almost_equal(N1 - R2, R).
```

This correction would properly evaluate subtraction operations and return the expected result of -13.666... for the test case.
