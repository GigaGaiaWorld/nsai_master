# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query Analysis

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided population and area data, then identifies country pairs where one density is slightly higher than the other (within a 5% margin).

## Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful queries:
```
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All queries returned expected results with probability 1.0000, indicating perfect matches within the specified density ratio criteria.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The program's core predicates (`density/2`, `query_pop/1`) and all supporting facts (`pop/2`, `area/2`) are correctly implemented and consistent with the test requirements.

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The density calculation `D is (P*100)//A` correctly computes persons per square mile (scaled by 100,000)
2. **Comparison Logic**: The ratio check `T1 is 20*D1, T2 is 21*D2, T1 < T2` properly implements the "approximately equal" condition (D1/D2 < 1.05)
3. **Termination**: The program terminates as it's non-recursive with finite facts

Probabilistic aspects:
- The results show probability 1.0000 for all matches, indicating deterministic facts
- No probabilistic facts or rules are present in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure deterministic facts)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. The integer division in density calculation could cause rounding differences
2. The 5% margin handles approximate equality well
3. All country pairs are explicitly listed - no undefined cases
4. Non-list input would fail gracefully due to Prolog's pattern matching

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete for the specified requirements. For extended functionality, consider adding:
1. Floating-point density calculations for precision
2. Additional countries and territories
3. Probabilistic population estimates
4. Time-series data for historical comparisons
