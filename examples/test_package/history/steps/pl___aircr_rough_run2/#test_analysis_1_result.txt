# Aircraft Flap Controller Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position changes over time considering actuator selection, wind effects, and goal achievement probabilities. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The system was tested with 10 queries (5 for `goal_reached` and 5 for `overrun_exception` at time steps 1-5). All test results show valid probability distributions that sum to ≤1 at each time step, indicating correct probabilistic computation.

**Query Results:**
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```

## Failure Localization
All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly handles:
1. Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split)
2. Wind effect distributions (weak/strong with proper sub-distributions)
3. Position calculation with wind effects
4. Goal checking and overrun detection

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Probability axioms are maintained (P(¬A) = 1-P(A))
2. Joint probabilities are correctly computed for actuator selection and wind effects
3. The position calculation (A5C06F43 hash block) properly combines:
   - Previous position
   - Actuator strength
   - Wind effect
   - Goal direction (sign function)

Key observations:
- Wind probabilities properly sum to 1 in both weak/strong cases
- Actuator selection maintains 0.5 probability for each option
- No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly handles position legality checks and goal verification
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Properly combines probabilities from multiple independent sources (actuators, wind)
3. **Edge cases**: Handles boundary conditions (initial position, overrun detection)

Potential improvements:
1. Add validation for wind effect magnitude vs actuator strength
2. Consider adding a maximum time limit to prevent infinite recursion
3. Could add visualization of probability distributions over time

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |
| 2 | None | None | None |
| 3 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and handles all specified scenarios properly. The probability distributions show expected behavior with decreasing likelihood of goal achievement over time (as more steps introduce more variability) and increasing then decreasing overrun probabilities (peaking around steps 3-4).
