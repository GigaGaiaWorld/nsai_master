<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Aircraft Flap Controller Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position changes over time considering actuator selection, wind effects, and goal achievement probabilities. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The system was tested with 10 queries (5 for `goal_reached` and 5 for `overrun_exception` at time steps 1-5). All test results show valid probability distributions that sum to ≤1 at each time step, indicating correct probabilistic computation.

**Query Results:**
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```

## Failure Localization
All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly handles:
1. Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split)
2. Wind effect distributions (weak/strong with proper sub-distributions)
3. Position calculation with wind effects
4. Goal checking and overrun detection

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Probability axioms are maintained (P(¬A) = 1-P(A))
2. Joint probabilities are correctly computed for actuator selection and wind effects
3. The position calculation (A5C06F43 hash block) properly combines:
   - Previous position
   - Actuator strength
   - Wind effect
   - Goal direction (sign function)

Key observations:
- Wind probabilities properly sum to 1 in both weak/strong cases
- Actuator selection maintains 0.5 probability for each option
- No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly handles position legality checks and goal verification
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Properly combines probabilities from multiple independent sources (actuators, wind)
3. **Edge cases**: Handles boundary conditions (initial position, overrun detection)

Potential improvements:
1. Add validation for wind effect magnitude vs actuator strength
2. Consider adding a maximum time limit to prevent infinite recursion
3. Could add visualization of probability distributions over time

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |
| 2 | None | None | None |
| 3 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and handles all specified scenarios properly. The probability distributions show expected behavior with decreasing likelihood of goal achievement over time (as more steps introduce more variability) and increasing then decreasing overrun probabilities (peaking around steps 3-4).

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
