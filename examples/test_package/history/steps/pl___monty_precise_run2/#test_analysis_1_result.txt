# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant picks a door (always door 1), the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the contestant can choose to keep their original choice or switch. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning correctly calculates the 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice and 2/3 chance by switching.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities match the expected Monty Hall problem solution:
- Equal 1/3 probability for each door hiding the prize
- Certainty of selecting door 1
- 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
- 2/3 probability of winning by switching

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Prize distribution (lines 1-2)
2. Door selection (line 3)
3. Host behavior rules (lines 6-15)
4. Win condition calculations (lines 16-21)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Prize distribution uses proper disjoint probabilities summing to 1
2. The host's door opening rules correctly implement:
   - Random choice between two empty doors (50/50 split)
   - Certain choice when only one empty door remains
3. Win conditions properly account for:
   - `win_keep`: Prize is behind initially selected door
   - `win_switch`: Prize is behind the remaining unopened door
4. Probability calculations follow standard rules:
   - P(¬A) = 1−P(A)
   - P(A∧B) handled through probabilistic conjunction

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct logical relationships between door states
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurate probability calculations
- **Edge cases**: Handles all door configurations (1-3 empty doors)

Key strengths:
1. Clear separation of probabilistic facts and deterministic rules
2. Proper handling of the host's constrained choices
3. Correct win probability calculations

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | - |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic reasoning. No errors were found in the 22-line code block. The solution demonstrates proper use of ProbLog for modeling conditional probabilities in game scenarios.
