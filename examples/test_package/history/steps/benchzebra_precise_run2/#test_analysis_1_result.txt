# Zebra Puzzle Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code attempts to solve the puzzle by defining constraints on house attributes (color, nationality, pet, drink, and cigarette brand) across five adjacent houses. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and identify any logical or syntactic errors.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a single failure:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs because:
1. The code uses `member/2` predicate (line 4) but doesn't provide its definition
2. While there is a `my_member/2` predicate defined later, it's not being used in the main constraints
3. Line number interval: 4-20 (all constraints using `member/2`)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Analysis**:
   - The logical structure of the puzzle constraints appears correct
   - Recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - The error is purely syntactic - using an undefined predicate

2. **ProbLog Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The error occurs before any probabilistic reasoning would take place
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (logical structure is correct but implementation incomplete)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The `houses/1` predicate properly initializes the 5-house structure
   - Recursive predicates have proper termination conditions
   - Missing input validation for non-list inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure of the program | Replace all `member/2` calls with `my_member/2` or import the proper list library |
| 2 | No error handling for malformed input | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for the Houses parameter |

## Corrective Action
To fix this implementation:
1. Replace all instances of `member/2` with `my_member/2` OR
2. Add `:- use_module(library(lists)).` at the beginning to import the standard member predicate

The corrected version would begin with:
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, spanish, dog, _, _), Houses),
    ...
```

This is a purely syntactic issue - the logical structure of the puzzle constraints appears sound and would likely solve the puzzle correctly once the predicate resolution issue is addressed.
