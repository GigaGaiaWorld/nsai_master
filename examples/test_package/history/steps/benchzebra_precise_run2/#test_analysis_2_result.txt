# Zebra Puzzle Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation against the puzzle's constraints and analyze the solution's compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a single successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 puzzle constraints and returns the valid house arrangement with full probability (1.0000).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The solution correctly handles:
- All member constraints (nationality, color, pet, drink, cigarette)
- Positional constraints (right_of, next_to)
- Special conditions (middle house drinks milk, Norwegian in first house)

## Root Cause Analysis
The classical Prolog implementation demonstrates correct logical reasoning:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All puzzle constraints are properly encoded as predicates
2. **Recursive Termination**: Helper predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) have proper base cases and recursive cases
3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: The solution satisfies all requirements:
   - Color/nationality/drink/smoke/pet associations
   - Relative positioning (green right of ivory, Norwegian next to blue)
   - Neighbor conditions (fox next to Chesterfields, horse next to Kools)

ProbLog-specific analysis:
- No probabilistic facts or rules were used (pure logical solution)
- DeepProbLog feature not used
- All deterministic constraints were correctly resolved

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets classical reasoning requirements:
1. **Complete Constraint Satisfaction**: All puzzle rules are correctly implemented
2. **Correct House Arrangement**: The solution matches known valid solutions to the puzzle
3. **Helper Predicates**: Properly defined and used

Edge cases considered:
- House list structure is properly enforced
- Position constraints handle all boundary cases
- Member checking works for all positions

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete, successfully solving the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints satisfied. No modifications are needed for this classical Prolog solution.
