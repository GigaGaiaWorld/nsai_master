System: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. You could use the available tools to complete the task.
Human: Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

0.7::burglary.
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: E353607E </HASH>
<Requirements>earthquake! (100% sure) </Requirements></Langda>
.
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 2A022806 </HASH>
<Requirements>The probablilty of alarm 1 sound an alarm is 0.9 </Requirements></Langda>
.
0.8::p_alarm2.
alarm :- burglary, earthquake, p_alarm1.
alarm :- 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 744B50FF </HASH>
<Requirements>If there's earthquake but not burglary, alarm 2 will sound an alarm </Requirements></Langda>
.
query(alarm).

</Code>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here
```

AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

0.7::burglary.
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: E353607E </HASH>
<Requirements>earthquake! (100% sure) </Requirements></Langda>

query(alarm).

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

0.7::burglary.
1.0::earthquake.
0.9::p_alarm1.
0.8::p_alarm2.
alarm :- burglary, earthquake, p_alarm1.
alarm :- \+burglary, earthquake, p_alarm2.

<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
