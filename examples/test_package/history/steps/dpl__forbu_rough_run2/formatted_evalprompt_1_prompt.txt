 Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for '!/0' at 11:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically examining its functionality and test results. The implementation was tested with a query to sort the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`, but encountered an execution error.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for '!/0' at 11:5.
```
No successful test results were recorded due to this fatal error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate implementation, specifically with the cut operator (`!`) at line 11 (as indicated by the error message). The problematic code section is:
```prolog
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, L1),
    !,  % This is where the error occurs
    bubblesort(L1, Acc, Sorted).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Analysis**:
   - The error suggests the ProbLog engine doesn't recognize the cut operator (`!`), which is a standard Prolog feature but may not be properly supported in the ProbLog environment being used.
   - The algorithm's logical structure appears correct for standard Prolog, with proper recursive termination conditions in both the base case and recursive case of `bubblesort/3`.

2. **ProbLog Specific Analysis**:
   - The implementation doesn't contain any probabilistic facts or rules, operating purely as a deterministic Prolog program.
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) are used in this implementation.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The implementation doesn't handle non-list inputs gracefully.
   - Performance with large lists could be problematic due to the O(n²) nature of bubblesort.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (algorithm is logically correct but fails due to environment limitation)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Implementation Quality**:
   - The bubblesort algorithm is correctly implemented for standard Prolog
   - The cut operator usage is appropriate for optimization but causes issues in ProbLog
   - Missing input validation for non-list cases

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Cut operator not supported in ProbLog environment | Complete failure | Rewrite without cuts or use standard Prolog |
| 2 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for list inputs |
| 3 | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic sorting | Consider adding probabilistic elements if needed |

**Recommendation**: This implementation should either be run in a standard Prolog environment that supports the cut operator, or rewritten to avoid using cuts if ProbLog compatibility is required. For a ProbLog solution, consider implementing a probabilistic version that handles uncertain comparisons or partially ordered lists.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
