# Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Analysis

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm through the `forth_sort/2` predicate. The code is intended to provide an interpretable sorting mechanism, but initial testing revealed execution failures. This analysis examines the test results, identifies failures, and provides recommendations for correction.

## Test Results Summary
The test executed a single query:
```prolog
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Test Result:**
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 1:21.
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`
   - **Expected:** Should return sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`
   - **Actual:** Runtime error due to missing predicate

2. **Error Location:**
   - Main predicate: `forth_sort/2` (line 1)
   - Missing predicate: `bubblesort/3` (called but not defined)

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue stems from a missing implementation of the `bubblesort/3` predicate. The code shows:

```prolog
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
```

Key problems identified:
1. **Logical Correctness:** The program is incomplete as it references an undefined predicate
2. **Recursive Termination:** Cannot be evaluated due to missing base case(s)
3. **Probabilistic Compliance:** N/A (no probabilistic facts or rules present)
4. **DeepProbLog Integration:** DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- ❌ Classical reasoning: Not met (missing implementation)
- ❌ Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
- ❌ Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. Undefined predicate (`bubblesort/3`)
2. No type checking for non-list inputs
3. No handling for empty lists
4. No performance considerations for deep recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `bubblesort/3` implementation | Complete failure | Implement proper bubblesort algorithm |
| 2 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for list inputs |
| 3 | No edge case handling | May fail on empty lists | Add base cases for empty/single-element lists |

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement the complete `bubblesort/3` predicate with proper recursive logic
2. Add base cases for empty lists and single-element lists
3. Consider adding input validation
4. For ProbLog compatibility, ensure proper handling of probabilistic facts if needed

The current implementation fails to meet basic requirements due to its incomplete nature. The primary correction needed is the implementation of the actual sorting algorithm before any meaningful testing can occur.
