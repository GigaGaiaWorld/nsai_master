<HASH> Hash tag of code: 47D659C8 </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable bubblesort/3 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>

query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 1:21.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Analysis

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm through the `forth_sort/2` predicate. The code is intended to provide an interpretable sorting mechanism, but initial testing revealed execution failures. This analysis examines the test results, identifies failures, and provides recommendations for correction.

## Test Results Summary
The test executed a single query:
```prolog
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Test Result:**
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 1:21.
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`
   - **Expected:** Should return sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`
   - **Actual:** Runtime error due to missing predicate

2. **Error Location:**
   - Main predicate: `forth_sort/2` (line 1)
   - Missing predicate: `bubblesort/3` (called but not defined)

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue stems from a missing implementation of the `bubblesort/3` predicate. The code shows:

```prolog
forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
```

Key problems identified:
1. **Logical Correctness:** The program is incomplete as it references an undefined predicate
2. **Recursive Termination:** Cannot be evaluated due to missing base case(s)
3. **Probabilistic Compliance:** N/A (no probabilistic facts or rules present)
4. **DeepProbLog Integration:** DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- ❌ Classical reasoning: Not met (missing implementation)
- ❌ Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
- ❌ Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. Undefined predicate (`bubblesort/3`)
2. No type checking for non-list inputs
3. No handling for empty lists
4. No performance considerations for deep recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `bubblesort/3` implementation | Complete failure | Implement proper bubblesort algorithm |
| 2 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for list inputs |
| 3 | No edge case handling | May fail on empty lists | Add base cases for empty/single-element lists |

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement the complete `bubblesort/3` predicate with proper recursive logic
2. Add base cases for empty lists and single-element lists
3. Consider adding input validation
4. For ProbLog compatibility, ensure proper handling of probabilistic facts if needed

**Word Count:** 398 words

The current implementation fails to meet basic requirements due to its incomplete nature. The primary correction needed is the implementation of the actual sorting algorithm before any meaningful testing can occur.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
