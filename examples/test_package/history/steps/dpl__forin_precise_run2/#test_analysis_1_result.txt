# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, recursive termination, and proper handling of edge cases.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorted the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly:
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (requirement 1)
2. Inserts the head element into the sorted list (requirement 2)

The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) and recursive case both function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The base case properly handles empty lists
- The recursive case correctly splits the list into head and tail
- The `insert_element/3` predicate properly handles:
  - Insertion into empty lists (line 1)
  - Insertion before smaller elements (line 2: `X =< H`)
  - Recursive insertion for larger elements (line 3: `X > H`)

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior
- No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure deterministic implementation)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty list input: Handled by base case
2. Single-element list: Handled through recursive case and base case
3. Already sorted list: Properly maintained by insertion logic
4. Duplicate elements: Handled by `=<` comparison

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add type checking for non-list inputs
2. Consider adding probabilistic version with uncertain comparisons
3. Add documentation for predicate arguments

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

The implementation is correct and handles all specified requirements. The test case demonstrates proper functionality for a typical unsorted list input. No errors were found during evaluation.
