# Merge Sort in Problog Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The code recursively splits lists, sorts sublists, and merges them back together. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and analyze its behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
Result:
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list with 100% probability, matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases for empty and single-element lists
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. Comparison operations during merging

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Problog Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The implementation follows standard merge sort logic:
   - Correct base cases (lines 1-2)
   - Proper list splitting (lines 10-13)
   - Accurate merging (lines 14-20)

2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates properly as:
   - The list length decreases with each split
   - Base cases handle lengths 0 and 1

### Probabilistic Analysis
1. The test shows 1.0000 probability, indicating deterministic behavior
2. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
3. **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met - correct sorting implementation
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used

### Edge Cases Consideration
1. **Empty List**: Handled by first clause
2. **Single Element**: Handled by second clause
3. **Odd-length Lists**: Correctly split by integer division
4. **Non-list Input**: Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | N/A |

The implementation is correct for the tested case and handles basic edge cases. For production use, additional type checking and more comprehensive test cases would be recommended to ensure robustness.
