<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program modeling a robot's actions with probabilistic outcomes. The code handles scenarios involving picking up keys, moving between locations, and managing slippery conditions. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query outcomes:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4813
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6930
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0070
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3000
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities are consistent with the defined rules and probabilistic facts in the program.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates and rules behave as expected:
- The `carrying/2` predicate correctly models key possession with probabilities
- The `at/3` predicates properly handle robot and key positioning
- All probabilistic facts (e.g., `pickup_succeeds`, `goto_succeeds`) follow proper probability distributions

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. **Negation Handling**: Properly implements `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` through `\+` operator
2. **Conjunction Handling**: Correctly computes joint probabilities for sequential actions
3. **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates have proper base cases
4. **Probability Propagation**: Probabilities combine correctly through the action sequence

Key probability calculations:
- The `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` probability of 0.4813 combines:
  - Initial pickup success (0.7)
  - Subsequent retention probabilities (0.8 for non-slippery, 0.4 for slippery)
  - Initial slipperiness probability (0.5)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly models state transitions
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Properly combines probabilistic outcomes
3. **Edge Cases**: Handles all specified scenarios without apparent issues

Potential improvements:
1. Add explicit checks for undefined positions
2. Consider performance with deeper recursion
3. Document probability calculation assumptions

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The code demonstrates correct implementation of probabilistic logic programming principles. DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
