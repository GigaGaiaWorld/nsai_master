# Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation through test case analysis and examine its compliance with Prolog's logical programming paradigm.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
Result:
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list [3,1,2,5,7,12] into [1,2,3,5,7,12] with 100% probability.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation correctly handles:
1. The base case (empty list)
2. The recursive case (non-empty list)
3. The insertion operation with proper comparison logic

## Root Cause Analysis
### Logical Correctness:
1. The algorithm follows proper insertion sort logic:
   - Line 1-3: Main predicate with accumulator initialization
   - Line 4: Base case termination
   - Line 5-7: Recursive case with proper head-tail decomposition
   - Line 8-12: Correct insertion logic with proper comparison cases

2. Recursive termination is guaranteed as:
   - Each recursive call processes a smaller list (T is always smaller than [H|T])
   - The base case handles the empty list condition

### Probabilistic Analysis:
- The result shows 1.0000 probability, indicating deterministic behavior
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
- **Classical reasoning**: Fully met - correct sorting implementation
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
- **Neural network integration**: Not applicable

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **Non-list input**: Not handled (would cause type errors)
2. **Empty list**: Handled correctly by base case
3. **Performance**: O(nÂ²) time complexity as expected for insertion sort
4. **Duplicate elements**: Handled correctly by =< and > comparisons

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input not handled | Runtime errors | Add type checking |
| 2 | No probabilistic features used | Limited to deterministic sorting | Consider adding probabilistic comparisons |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural network benefits | Consider hybrid sorting with learned comparisons |

The implementation correctly performs insertion sort in classical Prolog, though it could be enhanced with additional features and edge case handling. The core sorting functionality is logically sound and passes all basic test cases.
