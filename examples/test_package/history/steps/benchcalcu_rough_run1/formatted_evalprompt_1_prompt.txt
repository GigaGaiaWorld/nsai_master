<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Problog implementation solving the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The code uses constraint logic programming to find all valid digit assignments that satisfy the equation while adhering to arithmetic rules and uniqueness constraints.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 10 valid solutions with probability 1.0000 each:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies all constraints:
1. First digits (A,B,C) are non-zero
2. All digits are unique
3. The arithmetic relationship AB + BCD = CDE holds
4. Carry operations are correctly handled

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All expansion predicates (`digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and function as intended in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior:
1. **Classical Prolog aspects**:
   - The recursive `all_different/1` predicate correctly terminates when the list is empty
   - The `sumdigit/5` predicate properly handles both cases of addition (with and without carry)
   - Constraints prevent leading zeros through `leftdigit/1`

2. **Probabilistic aspects**:
   - All solutions have probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic facts
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The solution space is correctly enumerated without probability calculations

3. **DeepProbLog aspects**:
   - DeepProbLog features (neural networks, tensors) are not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the functional requirements:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correctly solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not utilized (as expected for this problem)
- **Neural network integration**: Not applicable

Edge cases handled correctly:
- Leading zero prevention
- Unique digit constraints
- Carry propagation in multi-digit addition

Potential improvements:
- Could add input validation for non-list inputs
- Could optimize the digit selection order for better performance

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Consider adding input validation |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Could optimize digit selection order |

The implementation correctly solves the specified cryptarithmetic puzzle with all constraints properly enforced. No errors were found in the testing process.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
