# Monty Hall Problem Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a player selects a door, after which the host opens another door revealing no prize, giving the player the choice to keep their original selection or switch to the remaining unopened door.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical error during evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:172.
```
The system failed to execute any queries due to this fundamental syntax error in the code.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate definition (lines 6-172 in the original code). The parser encountered an unexpected operator `->` without proper context, indicating malformed Prolog syntax.

Key issues identified:
1. The `open_door/1` predicate is incorrectly formatted with improper use of conditional statements
2. The probabilistic annotation `0.5::open_door(Door)` is syntactically invalid in this context
3. Missing proper clause separation and structure in the conditional branches

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation fails on multiple levels:

1. **Syntax Errors**: The conditional structure in `open_door/1` doesn't follow proper Prolog syntax for if-then-else constructs. The correct format should be:
```prolog
( Condition -> Then ; Else )
```

2. **Probabilistic Fact Placement**: The probability annotation `0.5::open_door(Door)` is incorrectly placed within a deterministic rule. Probabilistic facts must be defined separately from deterministic rules.

3. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic for Monty's door-opening behavior isn't properly translated into valid ProbLog syntax. The two required cases (random selection between two doors vs. deterministic opening of one door) need separate, clearly defined clauses.

## Overall Analysis
The current implementation fails to meet any of the functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Not functional due to syntax errors
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not properly implemented
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Key edge cases not handled:
- Invalid door numbers
- Multiple prize doors
- Already opened doors
- Non-integer inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed conditional syntax | Code cannot execute | Rewrite using proper Prolog if-then-else structure |
| 2 | Incorrect probability annotation | Invalid ProbLog syntax | Define probabilistic facts separately from rules |
| 3 | Missing base cases | Potential infinite recursion | Add proper termination conditions |
| 4 | Unvalidated inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation checks |

## Recommended Fixes
The `open_door/1` predicate should be restructured as:

```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    open_available(Len, AvailableDoors, Door).

open_available(2, [A,B], Door) :-
    0.5::door_temp(A),
    0.5::door_temp(B),
    door_temp(Door).
open_available(1, [A], A).
```

This corrected version:
1. Separates the probabilistic and deterministic cases
2. Uses proper Prolog syntax
3. Maintains the original logical requirements
4. Properly handles both cases of available doors
