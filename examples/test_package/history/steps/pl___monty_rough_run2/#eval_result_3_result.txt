{"HASH": "751033ED","ErrorSummary": "Missing implementation of open_door/1 predicate as specified in requirements, and unused open_available/3 predicate","SuggestedFix": "1. Remove open_available/3 if not needed or integrate it properly. 2. Implement open_door/1 with two clauses: (a) When two non-prize, non-selected doors exist, choose randomly between them. (b) When only one non-prize, non-selected door exists, choose it. Example implementation:\nopen_door(Door) :-\n    select_door(Selected),\n    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \\+ prize(D), D \\= Selected), Available),\n    (length(Available,2) -> random_member(Door, Available); Available = [Door]).","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
