# Monty Hall Problem Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a player selects one of three doors with a prize behind one door. The implementation should model the host's behavior when opening a door and calculate probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for 'open_door/1' at 14:5
```

All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) fail because the essential predicate `open_door/1` is undefined, making the entire model non-functional.

## Failure Localization
The primary failure occurs due to:
- Missing implementation of `open_door/1` predicate (required at line 14)
- The `open_available/3` helper predicate is defined but never used
- The requirements specify two specific behaviors for `open_door/1` that are not implemented

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**:
   - The prize distribution and door selection are correctly modeled with probabilistic facts
   - The winning conditions (`win_keep` and `win_switch`) are logically sound but depend on the undefined `open_door/1`

2. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - Prize distribution correctly uses 1/3 probability for each door
   - The negation in `win_switch` (`\+ open_door(A)`) would work probabilistically if `open_door/1` were defined

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet functional requirements because:
1. The core predicate `open_door/1` is missing entirely
2. The specified behaviors for Monty's door opening strategy are not implemented
3. The existing helper predicate `open_available/3` is not integrated into the solution

Edge cases not considered:
- No handling for invalid door numbers
- No validation for door selection
- No protection against infinite recursion in list membership

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `open_door/1` implementation | Entire model fails | Implement as specified: random choice between two non-prize doors or forced choice when only one option exists |
| 2 | Unused `open_available/3` predicate | Dead code | Either remove or properly integrate into solution |
| 3 | No error handling for invalid inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for door numbers and selections |

```prolog
% Suggested implementation for open_door/1
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), Available),
    random_member(Door, Available).
```

The implementation requires approximately 50 more lines of code to fully meet the requirements, including proper handling of both specified scenarios for Monty's door opening behavior and integration with the existing prize and selection predicates.
