</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Monty Hall Problem Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a player selects one of three doors with a prize behind one door. The implementation should model the host's behavior when opening a door and calculate probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for 'open_door/1' at 14:5
```

All queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`) fail because the essential predicate `open_door/1` is undefined, making the entire model non-functional.

## Failure Localization
The primary failure occurs due to:
- Missing implementation of `open_door/1` predicate (required at line 14)
- The `open_available/3` helper predicate is defined but never used
- The requirements specify two specific behaviors for `open_door/1` that are not implemented

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**:
   - The prize distribution and door selection are correctly modeled with probabilistic facts
   - The winning conditions (`win_keep` and `win_switch`) are logically sound but depend on the undefined `open_door/1`

2. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - Prize distribution correctly uses 1/3 probability for each door
   - The negation in `win_switch` (`\+ open_door(A)`) would work probabilistically if `open_door/1` were defined

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet functional requirements because:
1. The core predicate `open_door/1` is missing entirely
2. The specified behaviors for Monty's door opening strategy are not implemented
3. The existing helper predicate `open_available/3` is not integrated into the solution

Edge cases not considered:
- No handling for invalid door numbers
- No validation for door selection
- No protection against infinite recursion in list membership

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `open_door/1` implementation | Entire model fails | Implement as specified: random choice between two non-prize doors or forced choice when only one option exists |
| 2 | Unused `open_available/3` predicate | Dead code | Either remove or properly integrate into solution |
| 3 | No error handling for invalid inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for door numbers and selections |

```prolog
% Suggested implementation for open_door/1
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), Available),
    random_member(Door, Available).
```

The implementation requires approximately 50 more lines of code to fully meet the requirements, including proper handling of both specified scenarios for Monty's door opening behavior and integration with the existing prize and selection predicates.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
