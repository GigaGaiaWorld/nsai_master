# Monty Hall Problem Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, where a player selects a door and the host opens another door revealing no prize, giving the player the option to switch doors. The code aims to model the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate. The error message indicates an "Unmatched character '(' at 8:12" during parsing. No queries could be executed successfully due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate definition (lines 8-12):
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), Doors),  % Syntax error here
    findall(D, (member(D,Doors), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    open_available(Len, AvailableDoors, Door).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The first `findall/3` call is malformed - it's missing a closing parenthesis and has an undefined variable `Doors`.
2. **Logical Structure**: Even if syntactically correct, the predicate doesn't properly implement the Monty Hall rules:
   - It doesn't correctly identify available doors to open
   - The probabilistic choice between doors isn't properly structured

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax errors
   - Probabil reasoning: Prize distribution is correctly defined, but rules for door opening are broken
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined variable `Doors` would cause runtime errors
   - Non-list input isn't handled
   - Recursive cases aren't properly terminated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unmatched parenthesis in findall | Code won't compile | Fix parentheses and variable references |
| 2 | Undefined variable 'Doors' | Runtime error | Define Doors as [1,2,3] |
| 3 | Improper rule structure | Logical incorrectness | Rewrite open_door to properly implement Monty Hall rules |
| 4 | Missing edge case handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(Door) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), Doors),
    findall(D, (member(D,Doors), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), AvailableDoors),
    length(AvailableDoors, Len),
    open_available(Len, AvailableDoors, Door).
```

The analysis reveals fundamental syntax and logical issues preventing the code from executing as intended. The core probability distributions are correctly defined, but the rule implementations need significant revision to properly model the Monty Hall scenario.
