# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query Analysis

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates densities from population and area data, then finds country pairs where densities are within 5% of each other (using integer arithmetic for approximation). The evaluation verifies logical correctness and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 successful query outputs:
```
query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each result shows valid country pairs with density ratios between 0.95 and 1.05 (verified by the 20/21 ratio approximation).

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The predicates function as intended:
- `query_pop/1` (lines 1-6) correctly implements the density comparison logic
- `density/2` (lines 8-10) properly calculates integer densities using floor division

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The density calculation `D is (P*100) // A` matches requirements
   - The inequality chain `20*D1 < 21*D2, 20*D2 < 21*D1` properly approximates Â±5% density difference
   - The `C1 @< C2` constraint prevents duplicate pairs

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - All results show probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic facts
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are present in this classical Prolog implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets functional requirements:
- **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly finds country pairs with similar densities
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Country ordering constraint prevents duplicates
  - Integer arithmetic avoids floating-point precision issues
  - All listed countries have valid population/area data

Potential improvements:
1. Adding input validation for undefined countries
2. Including more countries for comprehensive testing
3. Adding probabilistic dimensions (e.g., uncertain population data)

The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. The arithmetic-based approximation for density comparison proves particularly effective in avoiding floating-point operations while maintaining precision.
