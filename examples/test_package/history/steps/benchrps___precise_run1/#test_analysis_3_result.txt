# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The system should correctly identify win/lose/draw outcomes for each round and calculate the final winner.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
No tests passed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate definition (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (cut off mid-implementation)
2. Malformed if-then-else construct in the original code
3. The correct implementation (provided in the Langda block) wasn't properly integrated

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issues are:
1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate was left incomplete with dangling `:-` operator
2. **Logical Structure**: The correct implementation requires proper if-then-else handling
3. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The recursive `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates are correctly defined
   - Termination conditions are properly handled for empty lists
   - The win/lose/draw logic follows standard rock-paper-scissors rules

The probabilistic aspects and DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Classical reasoning requirements are partially met (correct game logic but broken main predicate)
- Probabilistic reasoning and neural network integration are not implemented

**Edge Cases**:
- Non-list inputs aren't handled
- Uneven move lists would cause failure
- No input validation for invalid moves
- Deep recursion could be problematic for very long move sequences

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Compilation fails | Use complete implementation from Langda block |
| 2 | Malformed if-then-else | Logical flow broken | Properly format conditional statements |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation checks |

```prolog
% Corrected implementation
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The implementation would work correctly with the proper `determine_winner` predicate, as the core game logic in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is sound. The test case `([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor])` should return `player2` as the winner (score -1).
