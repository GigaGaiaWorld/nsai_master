# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The system should calculate round-by-round results and compute an overall winner.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
This indicates a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate (line 41) due to:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (missing closing parenthesis)
2. Improper use of the conditional operator `->/2`

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issues are:
1. **Syntax Error**: The `determine_winner` predicate is not properly closed and formatted
2. **Logical Structure**: The conditional logic for determining the winner needs proper Prolog syntax

The classical Prolog logic for the game rules is correct:
- `move/1` correctly defines valid gestures (rock, paper, scissor)
- `beats/2` properly encodes the game's win conditions
- `result/3` correctly determines round outcomes
- `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have valid recursive structures with proper termination

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not used in this implementation
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases**:
- Non-list inputs aren't handled
- Unequal move list lengths would cause issues
- No input validation for invalid moves

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Compilation fails | Fix syntax and properly close the predicate |
| 2 | Improper conditional operator usage | Logical error | Use proper Prolog if-then-else structure |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation and length checking |

## Corrected Code
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1 ; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2 ; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The corrected implementation would properly:
1. Calculate round results using `play/3`
2. Compute the total score with `compute_score/2`
3. Determine the winner based on the score
