  "ErrorSummary": "Missing implementations for 5 required predicates (implies/2, opposite/1, includes/2, extend/3, expand/2) despite being listed in requirements. Only refute/1 is implemented.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Add the following predicate implementations:\n1. implies(A, B) :- \\+ A; B.\n2. opposite(A) :- \\+ A.\n3. includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).\n4. extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).\n5. expand/2 is already defined in the examples section but should be moved to the extended logic processing section.",
