# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against test cases and evaluate its compliance with ProbLog semantics.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability 0.0000, indicating complete failure:
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob)))` failed
2. `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` failed
3. `prove(expand(double(3),6))` failed
4. `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` failed
5. `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` failed

## Failure Localization
The core issue is that none of the required extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) were actually implemented in the code, despite being listed in requirements. Only `refute/1` was partially implemented (line 10).

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Implementations**: The code lacks definitions for all required extended predicates except `refute/1`
2. **Probabilistic Semantics**: The current implementation doesn't handle probabilistic implications (P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B))
3. **Classical Logic**: Basic meta-interpreter works correctly for simple cases, but extended functionality is missing
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration detected ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Basic meta-interpreter works
   - Extended predicates: Not implemented
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not properly implemented
   - Neural integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined `expand/2` cases would fail
   - Non-list inputs to list predicates would cause errors
   - No protection against infinite recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `implies/2` | Cannot prove implications | Implement using ProbLog's probabilistic implication rules |
| 2 | Missing `opposite/1` | Cannot prove negations | Implement as `opposite(G) :- \+ prove(G)` |
| 3 | Missing `includes/2` | Cannot check list membership | Implement using existing `member/2` |
| 4 | Missing `extend/3` | Cannot prepend elements | Implement as `extend(List,Elem,[Elem|List])` |
| 5 | Incomplete `refute/1` | Limited negation capability | Ensure proper probabilistic negation handling |

```prolog
% Suggested implementations for missing predicates
implies(A,B) :- \+ prove(A); prove(B).
opposite(G) :- \+ prove(G).
includes(L,E) :- member(E,L).
extend(L,E,[E|L]).
```

The code requires significant expansion to meet all requirements. The basic meta-interpreter framework is sound, but all extended functionality needs to be properly implemented with attention to both classical and probabilistic semantics.
