# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes basic predicates like `member/2`, a meta-interpreter `prove/1`, and several extended logic predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.). The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability 0.0000, indicating complete failure:
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob)))` failed
2. `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` failed
3. `prove(expand(double(3),6))` failed
4. `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` failed
5. `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` failed

## Failure Localization
The core issue is that none of the required extended predicates were actually implemented in the code, despite being listed in requirements. The code only contains:
- Basic `prove/1` implementation (lines 4-12)
- A single `prove(refute(Goal))` rule (line 15)
- Example data and queries (lines 22-32)

Missing implementations:
1. `implies/2` predicate
2. `opposite/1` predicate
3. `includes/2` predicate
4. `extend/3` predicate
5. Complete `expand/2` rules (only examples given)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. The meta-interpreter cannot process the unimplemented predicates
2. No recursive termination checks exist for the unimplemented predicates
3. Probabilistic rules like P(¬A)=1−P(A) aren't implemented

Probabilistic aspects:
- All queries return 0.0 probability because the required predicates don't exist
- No probabilistic facts or rules are defined in the program
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements met:
- ❌ Classical reasoning (incomplete)
- ❌ Probabilistic reasoning (missing)
- ❌ Neural network integration (not attempted)

Edge case considerations:
- No handling of undefined `expand/2` cases
- No type checking for list operations
- No depth limiting for recursive predicates
- Missing error handling for malformed inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `implies/2` implementation | Cannot process implications | Implement proper implication logic |
| 2 | Missing `opposite/1` implementation | Cannot handle negations | Add negation handling with probabilistic rules |
| 3 | Incomplete `expand/2` rules | Only examples, no base implementation | Add proper predicate definition |
| 4 | Missing `includes/2` and `extend/3` | List operations fail | Implement list membership and extension |
| 5 | No probabilistic facts/rules | All queries return 0 probability | Add proper probabilistic elements |

The code currently fails all test cases due to incomplete implementation of required predicates. To fix this, all listed extended predicates need proper implementations that align with both classical and probabilistic logic rules.
