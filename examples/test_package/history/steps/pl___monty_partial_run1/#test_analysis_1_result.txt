# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a game show host reveals one of three doors after the contestant's initial selection. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and identify any implementation errors.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a parsing error:
```
problog.parser.ParseError: Operator priority clash at 8:29.
```

No queries could be evaluated successfully due to this syntax error preventing the program from running.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs at line 8, character 29 in the source code. The problematic section appears to be in the definition of probabilistic choices for opening doors when both remaining doors are empty.

The specific issue stems from incorrect syntax in the probabilistic choice statement:
```prolog
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The parser cannot handle the probabilistic choice syntax as written. In ProbLog, probabilistic choices must be properly formatted with clear separation between alternatives.

2. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic appears correct (random selection between two empty doors), but the implementation syntax is invalid.

3. **Probabilistic Rules**: The code attempts to implement:
   - P(open_door(A)) = 0.5 when both A and B are empty
   - P(open_door(B)) = 0.5 when both A and B are empty
   - P(open_door(A)) = 1 when A is empty and the other door has the prize

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but not testable due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Conceptually correct but syntactically invalid
   - Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where both remaining doors are empty
   - The code handles the case where one remaining door has the prize
   - List operations are properly implemented via member/2

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in probabilistic choice | Prevents entire program execution | Rewrite using proper ProbLog syntax for probabilistic disjunction |
| 2 | Missing proper rule termination | Potential infinite recursion risk | Ensure all recursive predicates have proper base cases |
| 3 | Unverified probabilistic calculations | Cannot confirm correctness | After fixing syntax, verify P(win_keep)≈1/3 and P(win_switch)≈2/3 |

## Recommended Fixes
The probabilistic choice should be rewritten using valid ProbLog syntax:
```prolog
open_door(A):0.5; open_door(B):0.5 :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    A \= B,
    A \= Selected,
    B \= Selected,
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ prize(B).
```

This report identifies the critical syntax error preventing execution and provides recommendations for correction. The underlying logic appears sound once the syntax issues are resolved.
