# Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`). The analysis verifies the correctness of the sorting functionality, checks recursive termination conditions, and examines edge case handling in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case demonstrates the following result:
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The single test case correctly sorts the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following components were verified:
- Base cases (lines 1-2) correctly handle empty and single-element lists
- Recursive case (lines 3-8) properly splits, recursively sorts, and merges sublists
- Split predicate (lines 9-11) correctly divides lists at midpoint
- Merge predicate (lines 12-18) accurately combines sorted sublists

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Analysis:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The implementation follows standard merge sort algorithm:
   - Base cases cover termination conditions
   - Recursive division maintains list integrity
   - Merge operation preserves sorted order

2. **Recursive Termination**: 
   - Length check (`Len > 1`) prevents infinite recursion
   - Split operation guarantees smaller sublists

### Probabilistic Analysis:
- The result shows deterministic behavior (probability 1.0)
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- "DeepProbLog feature not used"

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
- **Classical reasoning**: Fully implemented merge sort algorithm
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
- **Neural network integration**: Not used

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **Non-list input**: Would cause type errors (no explicit handling)
2. **Large lists**: Recursive depth could impact performance
3. **Duplicate elements**: Properly handled by merge predicate (line 14: `LeftH =< RightH`)
4. **Already sorted lists**: Works correctly but performs full sort anyway

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | Consider adding edge case tests |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Could optimize for already-sorted cases |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Add input validation for non-list cases |

```prolog
% Key predicates verified:
merge_sort([], []).                      % Base case 1
merge_sort([X], [X]).                    % Base case 2
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-              % Recursive case
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, LeftSorted),
    merge_sort(Right, RightSorted),
    merge(LeftSorted, RightSorted, Sorted).
```

The implementation correctly handles the demonstrated test case and appears structurally sound for standard merge sort operations. Additional test cases covering edge conditions would further validate robustness.
