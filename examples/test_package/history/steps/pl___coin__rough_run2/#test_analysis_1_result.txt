# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program that models coin tossing with a biased coin (probability of heads = 0.8). The program recursively counts the number of heads (S) when tossing CNT coins, with the test case showing results for CNT=4.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 heads when tossing 4 coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```
All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly follow the binomial distribution with n=4 and p=0.8, where:
- P(4 heads) = 0.8⁴ = 0.4096
- P(3 heads) = 4 × 0.8³ × 0.2 = 0.4096
- P(2 heads) = 6 × 0.8² × 0.2² = 0.1536
- P(1 head) = 4 × 0.8 × 0.2³ = 0.0256
- P(0 heads) = 0.2⁴ = 0.0016

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly implements the counting mechanism, handling both success (coin head) and failure (coin tail) cases.

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. The probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).` properly defines a biased coin
2. The recursive counting handles both cases:
   - When `coin(CNT)` succeeds (probability 0.8), it increments the count
   - When `coin(CNT)` fails (probability 0.2), it continues without incrementing
3. The negation `\+ coin(CNT)` correctly represents the tail case with P(¬A)=1−P(A)=0.2
4. The recursion properly terminates when CNT reaches 0

DeepProbLog features were not used in this program.

## Overall Analysis
The program successfully meets its functional requirements:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct recursive counting implementation
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper handling of probabilistic facts and their negations
- **Neural network integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used)

Edge cases considered:
- The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0).` ensures termination
- The count decrement `CNT1 is CNT - 1` prevents infinite recursion
- The probability calculations maintain proper distribution

## Error Summary

The program correctly implements a binomial probability distribution calculator for coin tossing scenarios with clear recursive logic and proper probabilistic handling. The test results validate the implementation matches expected mathematical probabilities.
