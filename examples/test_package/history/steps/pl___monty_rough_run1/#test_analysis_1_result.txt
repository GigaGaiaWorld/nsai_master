# Monty Hall Problem Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a player selects a door, after which the host opens another door revealing no prize, giving the player the choice to keep their initial selection or switch to the remaining unopened door.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities match the expected theoretical values:
- Each door has equal probability (1/3) of containing the prize
- The player's initial selection is fixed to door 1
- The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice is 1/3
- The probability of winning by switching is 2/3

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Uniform distribution of prizes (lines 1-2)
2. Player's initial selection (line 3)
3. Door opening logic (Langda block)
4. Win condition calculations (win_keep and win_switch predicates)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. Prize distribution uses proper probabilistic facts with P(prize(X)) = 1/3 for each door
2. The negation in `win_switch` correctly computes P(¬select_door(A)) = 2/3
3. The door opening logic properly handles both cases:
   - When two non-prize doors are available (uniform random selection)
   - When only one non-prize door is available (deterministic selection)

The implementation satisfies all probabilistic rules:
- P(¬A) = 1−P(A) is correctly handled in negations
- No implications are used that would require P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)+P(A∧B)
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly implements the game rules and player strategies
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes probabilities for all scenarios
3. **Neural network integration**: Not applicable (not used)

Edge cases handled correctly:
- The member/2 predicate safely handles list membership
- The findall/3 in open_door/1 ensures all valid doors are considered
- Recursion in member/2 is well-bounded by list length

Potential improvements:
1. Make select_door/1 probabilistic to allow for different initial choices
2. Add explicit handling for invalid inputs
3. Consider adding visualization of the probability distributions

## Error Summary
