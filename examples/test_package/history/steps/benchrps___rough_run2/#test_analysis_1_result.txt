# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates the implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The code defines the basic game rules, calculates game outcomes between two players, computes scores, and determines the winner. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and its adherence to the game's rules.

## Test Results Summary
The test query provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
The result was:
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The result correctly identifies player2 as the winner with a probability of 1.0, which matches the expected outcome based on the game rules:
1. rock vs paper → player2 wins
2. rock vs paper → player2 wins
3. rock vs scissor → player1 wins
Final score: -1 (1 win for player1, 2 wins for player2)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates function as intended:
- `move/1` correctly defines the valid moves (lines 3-5)
- `beats/2` correctly implements the game rules (lines 7-9)
- `outcome/3` properly determines win/lose/draw (lines 14-16)
- `play/3` correctly processes move lists (lines 18-21)
- `compute_score/2` accurately calculates the score (lines 23-26)
- `determine_winner/3` properly interprets the score (lines 27-31)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All rules correctly implement the rock-paper-scissors game logic. The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) properly handle base and recursive cases.
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both recursive predicates have proper base cases (`play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`) ensuring termination.
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: The implementation uses only deterministic facts and rules, with no probabilistic facts or complex probabilistic operations. The 1.0000 probability in the result reflects this determinism.

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the functional requirements for classical reasoning about the rock-paper-scissors game. Key observations:

1. **Edge Cases Handled**:
   - Empty move lists are properly handled
   - Draw situations are correctly identified
   - All possible move combinations are covered

2. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Input validation for non-move elements
   - Handling of unequal length move lists
   - Extension to probabilistic versions of the game

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - The recursive implementation is efficient for reasonable game lengths
   - Deep recursion could be problematic for extremely long games

## Error Summary
