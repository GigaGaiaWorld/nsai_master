</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes basic predicates like `member/2`, a meta-interpreter (`prove/1`), and several extended logic predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.). The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning aspects.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability 0.0000, indicating complete failure:
```
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 0.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000
```

## Failure Localization
All test cases failed because:
1. The required extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) were declared in requirements but never implemented in the code
2. While `expand/2` and `refute/1` were implemented, they weren't properly integrated with the `prove/1` meta-interpreter
3. The `clause/2` predicate is used but never defined for the custom predicates

## Root Cause Analysis
Key issues identified:
1. **Missing Implementations**: The extended predicates listed in requirements were not coded (lines 10-15 in requirements)
2. **Meta-interpreter Integration**: The `prove/1` predicate relies on `clause/2` but custom predicates aren't registered this way
3. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The code doesn't properly handle probabilistic implications (P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)+P(A∧B))
4. **Classical Logic**: Recursive termination is correct for `member/2` but missing for other predicates

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements assessment:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (only `member/2` works)
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (all queries return 0 probability)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge case considerations:
1. Undefined `expand/2` cases would fail silently
2. Non-list inputs to list predicates would cause errors
3. No protection against infinite recursion in custom predicates

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing predicate implementations | All extended logic fails | Implement all required predicates |
| 2 | Improper meta-interpreter integration | Can't prove custom goals | Add clause/2 facts or modify prove/1 |
| 3 | Incorrect probability handling | All results show 0 probability | Implement proper probabilistic reasoning |
| 4 | No error handling | Edge cases cause failures | Add input validation |
| 5 | Unused DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Either remove or implement neural components |

The main issue is that the extended predicates were specified in requirements but never implemented in code. The meta-interpreter architecture is sound but needs proper integration with the custom predicates. All test failures stem from these missing implementations rather than logical errors in existing code.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
