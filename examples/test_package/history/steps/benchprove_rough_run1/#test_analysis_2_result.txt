# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes basic predicates like `member/2` and several extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) for enhanced logical reasoning. The purpose is to verify correctness in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability 0.0000, indicating complete failure:
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` failed
2. `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` failed
3. `prove(expand(double(3),6))` failed
4. `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` failed
5. `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` failed

## Failure Localization
The core issue is that none of the required extended predicates were actually implemented in the code, despite being listed in requirements. The code only contains:
- Basic `member/2` (lines 1-3)
- Basic meta-interpreter `prove/1` (lines 5-13)
- One extended predicate `refute/1` (line 16)

Missing implementations:
1. `implies/2` (required but not implemented)
2. `opposite/1` (required but not implemented)
3. `expand/2` (rules exist but no prove handler)
4. `includes/2` (required but not implemented)
5. `extend/3` (required but not implemented)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. The meta-interpreter cannot process the unimplemented predicates
2. Recursive termination is correct for existing predicates
3. No probabilistic facts/rules are defined (only pure logic)

Probabilistic rules analysis:
- No probabilistic facts are used (all queries return 0.0000)
- The `refute/1` implementation (line 16) correctly follows P(¬A)=1−P(A)
- No implications are properly implemented for P(A⇒B) calculation

DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements status:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (basic meta-interpreter works)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not properly implemented
- Neural network integration: Not used

Edge case considerations:
- No handling for undefined `expand/2` cases
- No type checking for non-list inputs
- Recursive performance untested for deep structures
- Missing error handling for malformed queries

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `implies/2` implementation | All implication queries fail | Implement proper implication logic |
| 2 | Missing `opposite/1` implementation | Opposite checks fail | Add opposite/1 using negation |
| 3 | No prove handler for `expand/2` | Expand queries fail | Add prove(expand(X,Y)) :- expand(X,Y) |
| 4 | Missing `includes/2` implementation | Inclusion checks fail | Implement via member/2 |
| 5 | Missing `extend/3` implementation | List extension fails | Add extend(List,Elem,[Elem|List]) |
| 6 | No probabilistic facts/rules | All probabilities 0 | Add some probabilistic facts |

The main issue is incomplete implementation of required predicates. The meta-interpreter framework is correctly structured but cannot process unimplemented operations. All test failures stem from this fundamental implementation gap rather than logical errors in existing code.
