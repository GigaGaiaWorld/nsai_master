# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes basic predicates like `member/2`, a meta-interpreter (`prove/1`), and several extended logic predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.). The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning aspects.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability 0.0000, indicating complete failure:
```
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 0.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000
```

## Failure Localization
All test cases failed because:
1. The required extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) were declared in requirements but never implemented in the code
2. While `expand/2` and `refute/1` were implemented, they weren't properly integrated with the `prove/1` meta-interpreter
3. The `clause/2` predicate is used but never defined for the custom predicates

## Root Cause Analysis
Key issues identified:
1. **Missing Implementations**: The extended predicates listed in requirements were not coded (lines 10-15 in requirements)
2. **Meta-interpreter Integration**: The `prove/1` predicate relies on `clause/2` but custom predicates aren't registered this way
3. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The code doesn't properly handle probabilistic implications (P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)+P(A∧B))
4. **Classical Logic**: Recursive termination is correct for `member/2` but missing for other predicates

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements assessment:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (only `member/2` works)
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (all queries return 0 probability)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge case considerations:
1. Undefined `expand/2` cases would fail silently
2. Non-list inputs to list predicates would cause errors
3. No protection against infinite recursion in custom predicates

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing predicate implementations | All extended logic fails | Implement all required predicates |
| 2 | Improper meta-interpreter integration | Can't prove custom goals | Add clause/2 facts or modify prove/1 |
| 3 | Incorrect probability handling | All results show 0 probability | Implement proper probabilistic reasoning |
| 4 | No error handling | Edge cases cause failures | Add input validation |
| 5 | Unused DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Either remove or implement neural components |

The main issue is that the extended predicates were specified in requirements but never implemented in code. The meta-interpreter architecture is sound but needs proper integration with the custom predicates. All test failures stem from these missing implementations rather than logical errors in existing code.
