# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The purpose is to verify the correctness of classical and probabilistic reasoning, evaluate test results, and identify potential issues in the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
All 5 test queries returned probability 0.0000, indicating complete failure:
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob)))` = 0.0000
2. `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` = 0.0000
3. `prove(expand(double(3),6))` = 0.0000
4. `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` = 0.0000
5. `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` = 0.0000

## Failure Localization
All tests failed because the required extended predicates were not properly implemented:
1. Missing `implies/2` predicate (required for first test)
2. Missing `opposite/1` predicate (required for second test)
3. `expand/2` exists but isn't properly integrated with `prove/1`
4. Missing `includes/2` predicate (required for fourth test)
5. Missing `extend/3` predicate (required for fifth test)

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issues stem from incomplete implementation:
1. Classical Prolog aspects:
   - Recursive termination is correct in `member/2` and `prove/1`
   - Missing predicate definitions violate logical completeness
2. ProbLog aspects:
   - No probabilistic facts/rules are used in the program
   - Negation handling (`refute/1`) is correctly implemented
3. DeepProbLog: Feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements assessment:
1. Classical reasoning: Partially met (basic meta-interpreter works, but extended predicates missing)
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts/rules)
3. Neural network integration: Not applicable

Edge case considerations:
1. Undefined `expand/2` cases would fail silently
2. Non-list inputs to list predicates would cause type errors
3. Deep recursion performance untested
4. No error handling for malformed goals

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `implies/2` | First test fails | Implement implication logic |
| 2 | Missing `opposite/1` | Second test fails | Define opposite/1 using negation |
| 3 | `expand/2` not integrated | Third test fails | Add prove(expand(X,Y)) :- expand(X,Y) |
| 4 | Missing `includes/2` | Fourth test fails | Implement as alias for member/2 |
| 5 | Missing `extend/3` | Fifth test fails | Define extend(List,Elem,[Elem|List]) |

```prolog
% Suggested fixes for missing predicates
prove(implies(A,B)) :- prove((refute(A); B)).
prove(opposite(A)) :- refute(A).
prove(expand(X,Y)) :- expand(X,Y).
prove(includes(List,Elem)) :- member(Elem,List).
prove(extend(List,Elem,NewList)) :- NewList = [Elem|List].
```

The implementation requires completion of all specified extended predicates and proper integration with the meta-interpreter. The current version returns 0 probability for all tests because the required predicates are either missing or not properly connected to the prove/1 framework.
