# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query Analysis

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided facts and implements an efficient comparison method using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 successful query results:
```
query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results correctly identify country pairs with similar population densities (within 5% of each other) as specified by the inequality constraints.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly:
1. Calculates densities using floor division (`//`) as specified
2. Filters country pairs with `C1 @< C2` to avoid duplicate pairs
3. Applies the 5% tolerance check via integer inequalities

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical Prolog:
1. **Density calculation**: Correctly computes `(P * 100) // A` (lines 3-5)
2. **Comparison logic**: Properly implements approximate equality check via:
   ```prolog
   20*D1 < 21*D2,
   20*D2 < 21*D1
   ```
3. **Termination**: Guaranteed as all predicates are non-recursive and facts are finite

Probabilistic aspects:
- All results show probability 1.0000 as this is deterministic classical Prolog
- No probabilistic facts or rules are present in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented population density comparison
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure deterministic logic)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge cases considered:**
1. **Undefined countries**: Would safely fail if pop/2 or area/2 missing
2. **Zero area**: Division would fail (but no such cases in provided facts)
3. **Duplicate prevention**: `C1 @< C2` correctly handles pair ordering

**Code quality observations:**
1. Efficient integer arithmetic avoids floating-point issues
2. Clear variable naming (C1/C2 for countries, D1/D2 for densities)
3. Proper use of `@<` for standard term comparison
