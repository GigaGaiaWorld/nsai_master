System: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. You could use the available tools to complete the task.
Human: Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 501F546D </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

</Code>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here
```
</Final_Answer>


AI: 

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>
<origin_code>

<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: 501F546D </HASH>
<Requirements>This Prolog program should implement an interpretable insertion_sort/2 algorithm. </Requirements></Langda>
.
 
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).

</origin_code>
<generated_code>

insertion_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(List, [], Sorted).

insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc).
insertion_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    insert(H, Acc, NewAcc),
    insertion_sort(T, NewAcc, Sorted).

insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :-
    X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :-
    X > Y,
    insert(X, Ys, Zs).

<Final_Answer>
For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
