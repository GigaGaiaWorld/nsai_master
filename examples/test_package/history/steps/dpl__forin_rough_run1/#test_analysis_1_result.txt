# Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against test cases and analyze its compliance with Prolog's logical programming paradigm.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with 100% probability.

## 3. Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
- Base case (empty list)
- Recursive case (inserting elements in order)
- Comparison operations (`=<` and `>`)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The algorithm follows standard insertion sort logic:
  1. Starts with an empty accumulator (line 2)
  2. Inserts each element in order (lines 5-6)
  3. Uses proper comparison predicates (lines 9-12)

**Recursive Termination:**
- The recursion terminates properly when the input list is empty (line 4)
- Each recursive call reduces the problem size (line 6)

**Probabilistic Aspects:**
- The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure deterministic implementation)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
1. Empty list: Handled by base case (line 4)
2. Single-element list: Handled by `insert/3` base case (line 8)
3. Already sorted list: Handled by comparison clauses (lines 9-12)
4. Non-list input: Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)
5. Duplicate elements: Handled correctly via `=<` comparison

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

**Code Quality Observations:**
1. The implementation is clean and follows Prolog idioms
2. Could add type checking for non-list inputs
3. Could optimize tail recursion further (though current implementation is correct)

**Word Count:** 398

% Correct implementation for reference
insertion_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(List, [], Sorted).

insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc).
insertion_sort([H|T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    insert(H, Acc, NewAcc),
    insertion_sort(T, NewAcc, Sorted).

insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :-
    X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :-
    X > Y,
    insert(X, Ys, Zs).
