# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program that models a simple alarm system with probabilistic events (burglary, earthquake) and their impact on alarm activation. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and evaluate whether the implementation meets the specified requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The program contains one query:
- `query(alarm).` which returned probability 0.8700

All tests passed (no failures). The computed probability matches expectations based on the defined probabilistic rules and facts.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All requirements specified in the Langda blocks were correctly implemented:
1. Earthquake is defined as 100% certain (1.0 probability) as required
2. Alarm1 has correct 0.9 probability
3. The rule for alarm activation when earthquake occurs without burglary is properly implemented

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic computation is correct:
1. The probability of alarm is calculated as:
   - P(alarm) = P(burglary ∧ earthquake ∧ p_alarm1) ∨ P(¬burglary ∧ earthquake ∧ p_alarm2)
   - = (0.7 * 1.0 * 0.9) + (0.3 * 1.0 * 0.8) = 0.63 + 0.24 = 0.87

The implementation correctly handles:
- Probabilistic facts (burglary, earthquake, p_alarm1, p_alarm2)
- Logical conjunction (∧) through comma separation
- Logical negation (¬) through `\+` operator
- Disjunction (∨) through multiple rules with same head

## Overall Analysis
The program successfully meets its functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly implements logical relationships between events
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes joint probabilities
3. **Neural network integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases considered:
- The 100% certain earthquake simplifies some calculations
- The mutual exclusivity between burglary/¬burglary is properly handled
- All probabilities sum correctly (no probability leaks)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic computation follows standard probability rules and the logical relationships are properly encoded. No errors or warnings were detected during analysis.

```problog
0.7::burglary.
1.0::earthquake.  % E353607E - earthquake! (100% sure)
0.9::p_alarm1.    % 2A022806 - The probability of alarm 1 sound an alarm is 0.9
0.8::p_alarm2.
alarm :- burglary, earthquake, p_alarm1.
alarm :- \+burglary, earthquake, p_alarm2.  % 744B50FF - If there's earthquake but not burglary, alarm 2 will sound an alarm
query(alarm).
```

The computed probability of 0.87 for the alarm is correct given the defined model.
