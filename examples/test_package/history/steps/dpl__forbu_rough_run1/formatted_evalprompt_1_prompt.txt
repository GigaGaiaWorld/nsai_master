<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:13.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically examining its functionality and identifying any errors in the implementation. The code was tested with a query to sort the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`, but encountered an execution error.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:13.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at line 4 where the if-then-else construct (`->/2`) is used. The ProbLog engine cannot recognize this Prolog-specific control structure.

**Problematic Code Section:**
```prolog
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    (X > Y) ->
        bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted)
    ;
        bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Context**: The logical structure is correct for standard Prolog, but the implementation uses Prolog-specific control structures that aren't compatible with ProbLog.
2. **ProbLog Context**: ProbLog doesn't support the Prolog `->/2` operator directly. In ProbLog, conditional logic should be implemented differently, typically through separate clauses or probabilistic facts.
3. **DeepProbLog**: The code doesn't use any DeepProbLog features (neural network integration or tensor operations).

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct algorithm but incompatible syntax)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The implementation handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly
   - Non-list input would cause type errors
   - Recursive depth is appropriate for bubblesort (O(n²))

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog doesn't support Prolog's `->/2` operator | Code cannot execute | Rewrite using separate clauses or ProbLog-compatible conditionals |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | Limited to deterministic sorting | Add probabilistic facts or weighted choices if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | May fail on non-list inputs | Add type checking clauses |

**Recommendation**: Rewrite the bubblesort implementation using ProbLog-compatible syntax, either by:
1. Using separate clauses for each case (X > Y and X =< Y), or
2. Implementing a probabilistic version with weighted choices if probabilistic behavior is desired

Example rewrite (option 1):
```prolog
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X > Y,
    bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted).
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X =< Y,
    bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted).
```

This solution would maintain the algorithm's logic while being compatible with ProbLog's execution model.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
