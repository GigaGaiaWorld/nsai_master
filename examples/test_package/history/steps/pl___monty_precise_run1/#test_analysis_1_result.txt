# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, which demonstrates probability theory concepts through a game show scenario. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and ensure the implementation matches the well-known theoretical probabilities of winning by keeping or switching doors.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query probabilities:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results perfectly match the expected probabilities:
- Equal 1/3 probability for the prize behind each door
- Always selecting door 1 (as per `select_door(1)` fact)
- 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice
- 2/3 chance of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly implements:
1. Uniform prize distribution (lines 1-2)
2. Host behavior rules (lines 4-15)
3. Win condition definitions (lines 16-21)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. **Prize distribution**: `1/3::prize(X)` correctly implements uniform distribution
2. **Host behavior**:
   - When two empty doors available: random selection (50/50) via `0.5::open_door(A)`
   - When one empty door available: deterministic selection via `open_door(A)`
3. **Probability calculations**:
   - `P(win_keep) = P(prize(1)) = 1/3` (matches theory)
   - `P(win_switch) = 2/3` via `1 - P(win_keep)` (correct negation)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correct use of Prolog predicates (`member/2`, negation)
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper handling of probabilistic facts and rules
3. **Edge cases**: Handles all door selection scenarios (1 or 2 empty doors)
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

The code properly handles edge cases:
- Always exactly one prize exists
- Host never opens selected door or prize door
- All possible door configurations are considered

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete, demonstrating proper probabilistic reasoning for the Monty Hall problem scenario. All test cases pass with expected probabilities, confirming the code's validity.
