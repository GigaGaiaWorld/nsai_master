# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Problog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query population and area data to find countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program calculates population density from given facts about countries' populations and areas, then finds pairs of countries meeting the density similarity criteria.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 8 successful query results:
```
query_pop([china, 244.0828402366864, france, 246.4788732394366]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223.859649122807, pakistan, 219.2926045016077]) = 1.0000
query_pop([pakistan, 219.2926045016077, indonesia, 223.859649122807]) = 1.0000
query_pop([mexico, 76.04712041884817, ethiopia, 77.71428571428571]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477.58620689655174, philippines, 461.1111111111111]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246.4788732394366, china, 244.0828402366864]) = 1.0000
query_pop([philippines, 461.1111111111111, italy, 477.58620689655174]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77.71428571428571, mexico, 76.04712041884817]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The program correctly identifies country pairs with population densities within 5% of each other, and all calculated density values match expected results.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The program successfully:
1. Calculates population densities correctly using the `density/2` predicate
2. Compares densities within the specified 5% range
3. Ensures country pairs are distinct (Country1 \= Country2)
4. Returns results in both possible orderings (A,B and B,A)

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical Prolog terms:
1. The `density/2` predicate correctly computes density as (Pop*100000)/(Area*1000)
2. The `query_pop/1` predicate properly implements the 5% similarity check (Ratio >= 0.95, Ratio =< 1.05)
3. All recursive operations terminate properly as there are no recursive calls
4. The probabilistic aspect is minimal (all facts are certain with probability 1.0)

**DeepProbLog Feature:** DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
The program fully meets its functional requirements for classical reasoning about population densities. Key strengths include:
1. Correct density calculation accounting for unit scaling (100000s of people and 1000s of square miles)
2. Proper handling of the similarity threshold (5%)
3. Comprehensive pair generation without duplicates

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. Input validation for non-country names (currently handled by failing the query)
2. Handling of missing data (currently all countries have both population and area)
3. Performance with very large datasets (currently not an issue with 22 countries)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No modifications are needed for the current functionality. For extended use, consider adding input validation and handling for missing data cases.
