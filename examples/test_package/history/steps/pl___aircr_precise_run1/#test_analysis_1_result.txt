# Aircraft Flap Controller Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The system models flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against specified requirements and analyze the probabilistic behavior.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probabilities for queries between time steps 1-5:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
- goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
- goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
- goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
- goal_reached(5) = 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114

All tests passed (no failures) as the results show consistent probabilistic behavior without any contradictory outcomes.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Goal checking (prevents new position calculation when goal is reached)
2. Actuator selection and strength determination
3. Direction calculation and wind effect integration
4. Legal position validation

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic model correctly implements:
- Actuator selection (50/50 probability between actuators a and b)
- Wind strength modeling (weak/strong with different effect distributions)
- Position calculation (combining actuator thrust and wind effects)
- Legal position validation (0-10 range)

Probability rules are correctly applied:
- `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` for negative conditions
- `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` for implications
- Joint probabilities correctly calculated for combined events

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly handles the flap position logic
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Properly models uncertainties in actuator selection and wind effects
3. **Neural network integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used)

Edge cases handled:
- Position bounds checking (0-10 range)
- Goal state termination condition
- Wind effect magnitude variations
- Actuator strength differences

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation shows robust probabilistic modeling of the aircraft flap control system with proper handling of all specified requirements and edge cases. The decreasing probability of reaching the goal over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty in the system's behavior.
