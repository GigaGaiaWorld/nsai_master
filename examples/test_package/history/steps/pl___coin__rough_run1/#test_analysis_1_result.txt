# ProbLog Code Analysis Report

## Background and Purpose
This report analyzes a ProbLog program that models coin tossing behavior. The code defines a probabilistic coin with an 80% chance of landing heads and implements a recursive counting mechanism to tally heads from multiple tosses. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both the logical structure and probabilistic computations.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 heads when tossing 4 coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```
All test cases match the expected binomial distribution probabilities for n=4 trials with p=0.8 success probability. **All tests passed (no failures)**.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly implements the counting mechanism, and the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` with probability 0.8 is properly defined.

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. The probability of ¬coin(C) is correctly computed as 1-0.8 = 0.2
2. The recursive counting follows binomial distribution rules:
   - P(4 heads) = 0.8⁴ = 0.4096 ✓
   - P(3 heads) = C(4,3)*0.8³*0.2 = 4*0.512*0.2 = 0.4096 ✓
   - P(2 heads) = C(4,2)*0.8²*0.2² = 6*0.64*0.04 = 0.1536 ✓
   - P(1 head) = C(4,1)*0.8*0.2³ = 4*0.8*0.008 = 0.0256 ✓
   - P(0 heads) = 0.2⁴ = 0.0016 ✓

The recursive termination condition `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` is properly defined to stop recursion when CNT reaches 0.

## Overall Analysis
The program successfully meets its functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correct recursive counting implementation
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurate probability calculations
3. **Neural network integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases considered:
- The base case (CNT=0) properly terminates recursion
- The probabilistic fact handling covers both success and failure cases
- The counting mechanism correctly accumulates results

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The code demonstrates correct implementation of probabilistic logic programming principles with proper handling of both success and failure cases in the recursive counting mechanism. All test cases match the expected binomial distribution probabilities, confirming the implementation's correctness.
