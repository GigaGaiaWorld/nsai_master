# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Digit Addition

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to perform simple digit addition using image-based inputs. The program consists of digit facts (img_1 to img_0) and an addition rule that sums the numeric values associated with these images. The evaluation verifies the correctness of both the fact declarations and the addition logic.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show one query execution:
```
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
```
With result:
```
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
```

All tests passed (no failures). The query correctly returns that the sum of digit 5 (img_5) and digit 6 (img_6) is 11 with 100% probability, which matches the expected behavior.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The program successfully:
1. Correctly associates images with their corresponding digits (img_1 to img_0)
2. Properly implements the addition logic through the `addition/3` predicate
3. Returns the correct sum with appropriate probability (1.0 for deterministic facts)

## Root Cause Analysis
In this classical ProbLog scenario:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The program is logically sound. Each `digit/2` fact correctly maps an image to its numeric value, and the addition rule properly sums these values.
2. **Termination**: The program is non-recursive and will always terminate.
3. **Probabilistic Rules**: All facts are deterministic (probability 1.0), so no complex probability computations are needed. The simple addition operation maintains the deterministic nature of the results.

DeepProbLog features were not used in this program (no neural network integration).

## Overall Analysis
The program meets its functional requirements for classical reasoning:
- Correctly represents digit-image relationships
- Accurately performs addition operations
- Returns deterministic results as expected

Edge cases considered:
1. The program handles all single-digit additions (0-9) correctly
2. No list inputs are used, so non-list cases don't apply
3. No recursion is present, so performance isn't a concern
4. All possible digit combinations are covered by the facts

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

The program is correctly implemented and passes all tests. No errors or improvements were identified in the current implementation. For future extensions, consider adding probabilistic digit recognition or neural network integration for more complex scenarios.
