/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining consistency with the original code's functionality. It simplifies the door-opening rule by using a findall predicate to identify valid doors that can be opened, ensuring the host's behavior remains probabilistic (50/50 when two doors are available). The results match the original, showing correct probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors.
