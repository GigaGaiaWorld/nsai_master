/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is logically equivalent to the original code, producing the same results. The main difference is the restructuring of the recursive clause in 'coins_r', where the generated code combines the recursive calls within the conditional branches. This change does not affect the functionality or the probability calculations. Both codes correctly model the scenario of flipping four coins with an 80% chance of success each and calculate the probabilities of getting 0 to 4 successes.
