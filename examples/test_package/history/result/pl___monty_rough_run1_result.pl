/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, producing the same probabilities as the original code. It simplifies the door-opening mechanism by using findall to select a non-prize, non-selected door deterministically, while the original used probabilistic rules. Both versions correctly show a 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice and 2/3 chance by switching. The generated code is more concise but equally valid for this problem.
