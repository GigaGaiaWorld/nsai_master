0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-
 
 between(1, N, I), I < N, pick(I, b), pick(I + 1, b).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is syntactically correct and maintains the same logical structure as the original code. However, the implementation of the 'bb' predicate differs slightly. The original code uses 'Max is N-1' and checks 'between(1,Max,I)', while the generated code directly checks 'I < N' within the 'between' predicate. This change affects the probability calculation, leading to a different result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is valid but produces inconsistent results due to the altered condition in the 'bb' predicate.
