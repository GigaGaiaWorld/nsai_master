/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code has syntax errors and does not run successfully, as indicated by the ParseError. The main issue is with the operator priority clash in the probabilistic rules. The original code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem with proper probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors. The generated code fails to maintain this correctness due to syntax issues and incomplete rule definitions.
