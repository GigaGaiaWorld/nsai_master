0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-
 
 between(1, N, I), I < N, pick(I, b), pick(I+1, b).
len(5).
evidence(palindrome(X)) :- len(X).
query(bb(X)) :- len(X).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, the 'bb' predicate in the generated code has been simplified by combining conditions, which changes its behavior. The original code checks for consecutive 'b's up to N-1, while the generated code checks for consecutive 'b's up to N, leading to a different probability calculation. This results in a different output probability (0.6484 vs 0.3750).
