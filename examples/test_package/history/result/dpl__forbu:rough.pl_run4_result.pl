/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not valid as it results in an error during execution. The error indicates that there are no clauses found for a specific operation, suggesting that the implementation of the sorting logic is incorrect or incomplete. The original code successfully sorts the list using a bubble sort algorithm, while the generated code fails to execute due to syntax or logical errors. The generated code does not maintain the consistency with the original code's functionality.
