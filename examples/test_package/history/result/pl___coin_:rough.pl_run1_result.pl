/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause by using 'coin(C)' without binding C to a specific value, which leads to an error during execution. The original code correctly uses 'coin(CNT)' within a disjunction to count successful coin flips. The generated code's approach of using 'C = heads' is also problematic as it doesn't align with the original code's logic of counting successes.
