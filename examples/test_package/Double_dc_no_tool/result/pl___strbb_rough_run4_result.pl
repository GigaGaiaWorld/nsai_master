% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes compute the probability of two adjacent 'b' picks in a palindrome of length 5, resulting in the same probability of 0.3750. The generated code simplifies the 'bb' predicate by directly using 'between' and 'J is I + 1' without needing to calculate 'Max' separately, which is a minor improvement. The logic and probabilistic outcomes remain unchanged.
