% Basic rules of rock-paper-scissors
% -------------------------
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).
% -------------------------
% Calculate the result of the game
% -------------------------
% Same gestures are considered a draw
result(X, X, draw) :-
 move(X).
 
% If X beats Y, then X wins
result(X, Y, win) :-
beats(X, Y).
% If Y beats X, then X loses
result(X, Y, lose) :-
beats(Y, X).
 
% End of recursion: empty list corresponds to empty result
play([], [], []).
% Recursive advancement: take out each round of gestures, calculate the results, and continue
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
% The correct call is result(P1,P2,R), not semicolon
result(P1, P2, R),
% (Optional) Update the score according to R
play(P1T, P2T, Rs).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it introduces a syntax error in the 'determine_winner' predicate by using an arrow (->) operator incorrectly, which is not valid in standard Prolog syntax. This causes the code to fail during execution. The original code uses semicolons (;) for disjunction, which is correct. The logic for determining the winner and computing scores remains the same in both codes.
