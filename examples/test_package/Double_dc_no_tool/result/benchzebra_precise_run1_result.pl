/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code has several issues compared to the original code. First, the order of attributes in the house predicates is inconsistent, which affects the logic. For example, 'house(english, red, _, _, _)' should be 'house(red, english, _, _, _)'. Second, some attribute placements are incorrect, like 'snail' instead of 'snails' and 'dog' being in the wrong position. These inconsistencies lead to a different solution structure, though the final answer still identifies the zebra owner correctly. The generated code is valid in form but produces a result with attribute positions swapped compared to the original.
