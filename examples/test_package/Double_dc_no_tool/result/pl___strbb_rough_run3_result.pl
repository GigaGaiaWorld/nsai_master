0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code has a syntax error in the 'between' predicate call, where 'N-1' is not properly evaluated before being passed as an argument. This causes a CallModeError because 'between/3' expects integer arguments. The original code correctly computes 'Max is N-1' before calling 'between'. The logic of both codes is otherwise identical, but the generated code fails to run due to this error.
