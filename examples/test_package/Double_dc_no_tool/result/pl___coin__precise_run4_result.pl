/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to simplify the original code by using a conditional statement (->) instead of separate clauses with disjunction (;). However, this approach is syntactically incorrect in Prolog/ProbLog, leading to a runtime error. The original code correctly uses disjunction to handle both cases of coin(CNT) being true or false, while the generated code's syntax is not valid in this context. The error message indicates that the '->' operator is not recognized as a valid clause.
