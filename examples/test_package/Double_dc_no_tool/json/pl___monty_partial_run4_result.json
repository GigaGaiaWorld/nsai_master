  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It simplifies the conditions in the `open_door` rules by explicitly stating the constraints on the selected door (S) and ensuring A and B are distinct and not the selected door. This makes the code clearer while maintaining the same probabilistic outcomes. Both codes produce identical results for the Monty Hall problem, with win_keep at 0.3333 and win_switch at 0.6667."
