  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally equivalent to the original code, producing the same result for the query bb(5). The main difference is in the implementation of the bb/1 predicate, where the generated code uses a more concise approach with between/3 and direct arithmetic comparison, while the original uses Max and separate conditions. Both versions correctly check for consecutive 'b' picks. The generated code is valid and maintains the same probabilistic behavior as the original."
