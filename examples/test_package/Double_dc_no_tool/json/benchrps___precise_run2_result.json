  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it introduces a syntax error in the 'determine_winner' predicate by using an arrow (->) operator incorrectly, which is not valid in standard Prolog syntax. This causes the code to fail during execution. The original code uses semicolons (;) for disjunction, which is correct. The logic for determining the winner and computing scores remains the same in both codes."
