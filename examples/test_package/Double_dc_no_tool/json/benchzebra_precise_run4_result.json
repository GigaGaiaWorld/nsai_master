  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues compared to the original code. The order of attributes in the house predicates is inconsistent, leading to incorrect mappings (e.g., 'english' and 'red' are swapped, 'dog' is placed in the wrong position). Some predicates are also malformed, such as 'snail' instead of 'snails'. Despite these issues, the generated code is syntactically valid and produces a result, but the result is not consistent with the original due to the attribute misordering."
