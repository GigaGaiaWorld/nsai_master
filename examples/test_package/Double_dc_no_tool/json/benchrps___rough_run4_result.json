  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It correctly implements the rock-paper-scissors game rules and computes the winner based on the moves provided. The main difference is the use of 'outcome/3' predicate instead of 'result/3', but this change does not affect the logic or results. Both codes produce the same output for the given query."
