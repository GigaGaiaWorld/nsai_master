  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct but has some inconsistencies with the original code. The order of attributes in the house predicates is different, which affects readability but not functionality. Some predicates like 'my_member(house(_, _, _, winstons, snail), Houses)' have swapped arguments (snail should be snails). Despite these issues, the generated code produces a valid and consistent result with the original code, solving the zebra puzzle correctly."
