  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog and produce the same sorted result for the given input. However, the generated code has a formatting issue where the line 'insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),' is not properly aligned, which could lead to readability concerns but does not affect the execution. The logic and structure of the generated code remain intact, and it correctly performs the sorting operation as expected."
