  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues. First, it uses 'member/2' instead of 'my_member/2', which causes an error since 'member/2' is not defined. Second, the order of attributes in some house predicates is inconsistent with the original code (e.g., 'house(english, red, _, _, _)' vs 'house(red, english, _, _, _)'). These inconsistencies lead to a runtime error and incorrect results. The generated code does not meet the requirements due to these syntax and logical errors."
