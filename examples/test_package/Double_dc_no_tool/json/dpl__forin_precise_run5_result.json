  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes implement the insertion sort algorithm in Prolog and produce the same correct sorted output for the given input. However, the generated code has an unnecessary line break after the first clause of insertion_sort/2, which does not affect functionality but is a minor formatting inconsistency. The logic and structure of both codes are identical, and they yield the same result."
