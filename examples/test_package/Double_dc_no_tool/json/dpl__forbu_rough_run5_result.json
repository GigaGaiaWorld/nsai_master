  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm but contains syntax errors and logical issues. The main problem is the use of '->' operator which is not correctly implemented in Problog, leading to an 'UnknownClause' error. The original code correctly implements bubble sort using a different approach with swap predicates and works as expected. The generated code fails to run due to syntax issues, while the original code produces the correct sorted output."
