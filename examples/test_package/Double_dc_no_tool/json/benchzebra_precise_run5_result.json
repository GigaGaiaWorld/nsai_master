  "final_report": "The generated code has several issues compared to the original code. The order of attributes in the house predicates is inconsistent, leading to incorrect mappings (e.g., 'english' and 'red' are swapped, 'dog' is placed in the wrong position). Some predicates are malformed (e.g., 'snail' instead of 'snails'). Despite these issues, the generated code runs and produces a result, but the result is not consistent with the original code's output due to the attribute misordering and malformed predicates."
