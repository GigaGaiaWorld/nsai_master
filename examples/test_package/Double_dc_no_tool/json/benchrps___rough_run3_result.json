  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It simplifies the original code by combining the result predicates into a single play_round predicate, which improves readability without changing the behavior. Both codes correctly implement the rock-paper-scissors game logic and compute the winner based on the same scoring system. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
