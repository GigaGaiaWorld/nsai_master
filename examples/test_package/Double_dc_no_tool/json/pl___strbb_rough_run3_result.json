  "final_report": "The generated code has a syntax error in the 'between' predicate call, where 'N-1' is not properly evaluated before being passed as an argument. This causes a CallModeError because 'between/3' expects integer arguments. The original code correctly computes 'Max is N-1' before calling 'between'. The logic of both codes is otherwise identical, but the generated code fails to run due to this error."
