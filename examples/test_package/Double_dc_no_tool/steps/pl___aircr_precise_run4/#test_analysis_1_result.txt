# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system models actuator selection, wind effects, and flap position control with probabilistic components. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in the implementation.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probabilities for queries:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
```

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
```
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results show logically consistent probabilities that decrease over time for goal achievement and show minimal overrun exceptions.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Goal checking (`goal_reached/1`)
- Actuator selection (`use_actuator/2`)
- Wind effect calculation (`wind_effect/2`)
- Position calculation (`attempted_flap_position/2`)
- Legal position validation (`legal_flap_position/1`)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented:
1. Actuator selection follows the 50/50 distribution between actuators a and b
2. Wind strength probabilities are properly cascaded to wind effects
3. Probability calculations for combined effects (actuator + wind) are mathematically sound
4. The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` correctly computes the overrun probability
5. No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are used in this implementation

## 5. Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:

**Classical Reasoning:**
- Correctly models the flap position dynamics
- Properly handles termination when goal is reached
- Validates legal positions (0-10 range)

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**
- Accurately combines probabilities from multiple sources (actuators, wind)
- Correctly handles probabilistic facts and their combinations
- Properly computes joint probabilities for complex events

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Initial position (6) and goal (4) are within legal range
- Wind effects can push position beyond limits (handled by overrun)
- All time steps properly consider previous position

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

**Code Quality Observations:**
1. The implementation would benefit from comments explaining the probability calculations
2. Consider adding validation that initial position is legal
3. The wind effect probabilities could be parameterized for flexibility

**Word Count:** 423 words

```prolog
% Well-implemented core logic example:
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time-1,
    flap_position(Prev,Old),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time,A),
    actuator_strength(A,AS),
    goal(GP),
    Direction is sign(GP - Old),
    AE is Direction * AS,
    wind_effect(Time,WE),
    Pos is Old + AE + WE.
```

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning with proper handling of both success and failure cases in the aircraft control scenario.
