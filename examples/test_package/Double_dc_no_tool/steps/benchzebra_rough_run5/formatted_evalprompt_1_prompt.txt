</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of constraints involving nationalities, beverages, pets, and other attributes. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly satisfied.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned a single solution with probability 1.0000:
```prolog
[house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
 house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
 house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
 house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
 house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution satisfies all 15 constraints specified in the puzzle:
1. Englishman in the red house
2. Spaniard owns the dog
3. Coffee drunk in green house
4. Ukrainian drinks tea
5. Green house immediately to right of ivory
6. Snails eater owns Winstons
7. Kools smoked in yellow house
8. Milk drunk in middle house
9. Norwegian in first house
10. Chesterfields smoker lives next to fox
11. Kools smoker lives next to horse
12. Lucky Strikes smoker drinks orange juice
13. Japanese smokes Parliaments
14. Norwegian lives next to blue house
15. Zebra and water drinker identified

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and support the main puzzle constraints.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical Prolog reasoning:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All constraints are properly translated into Prolog rules
2. **Recursive Termination**: Helper predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`) have proper base cases
3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: The solution satisfies all puzzle constraints simultaneously

Probabilistic aspects:
- The solution shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic satisfaction
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure logical puzzle)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. House ordering constraints properly handled via `right_of/3`
2. All attribute combinations properly constrained
3. Positional constraints (e.g., milk in middle house) correctly implemented
4. Next-to relationships properly defined via `next_to/3`

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Could add input validation for house structures
2. Could optimize the constraint ordering for better performance
3. Could add explanatory comments for each constraint

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct | 

**Word Count**: 398 words

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly satisfied. The code is well-structured and demonstrates proper use of Prolog's logical reasoning capabilities.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
