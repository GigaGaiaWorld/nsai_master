# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of constraints involving nationalities, beverages, pets, and other attributes. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly satisfied.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned a single solution with probability 1.0000:
```prolog
[house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
 house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
 house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
 house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
 house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution satisfies all 15 constraints specified in the puzzle:
1. Englishman in the red house
2. Spaniard owns the dog
3. Coffee drunk in green house
4. Ukrainian drinks tea
5. Green house immediately to right of ivory
6. Snails eater owns Winstons
7. Kools smoked in yellow house
8. Milk drunk in middle house
9. Norwegian in first house
10. Chesterfields smoker lives next to fox
11. Kools smoker lives next to horse
12. Lucky Strikes smoker drinks orange juice
13. Japanese smokes Parliaments
14. Norwegian lives next to blue house
15. Zebra and water drinker identified

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and support the main puzzle constraints.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical Prolog reasoning:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All constraints are properly translated into Prolog rules
2. **Recursive Termination**: Helper predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`) have proper base cases
3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: The solution satisfies all puzzle constraints simultaneously

Probabilistic aspects:
- The solution shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic satisfaction
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure logical puzzle)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. House ordering constraints properly handled via `right_of/3`
2. All attribute combinations properly constrained
3. Positional constraints (e.g., milk in middle house) correctly implemented
4. Next-to relationships properly defined via `next_to/3`

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Could add input validation for house structures
2. Could optimize the constraint ordering for better performance
3. Could add explanatory comments for each constraint
