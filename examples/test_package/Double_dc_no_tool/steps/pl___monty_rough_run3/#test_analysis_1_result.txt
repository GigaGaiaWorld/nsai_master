# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a player selects a door, the host (Monty) opens another door, and the player decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The purpose is to verify the correct probabilistic modeling of this scenario and validate the implementation against expected outcomes.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected probabilities:
- Each door has an equal 1/3 chance of hiding the prize
- The player initially selects door 1 (fixed)
- Keeping the initial choice wins 1/3 of the time
- Switching doors wins 2/3 of the time

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Uniform random selection between two available doors when Monty has a choice
2. Forced selection when only one door is available for Monty to open

## Root Cause Analysis
The code correctly implements probabilistic logic:
1. Prize distribution uses proper probabilistic facts with `1/3::prize(X)`
2. The `open_door` predicate correctly models Monty's behavior:
   - When two doors are available (`length(Doors, 2)`), it assigns equal probability (0.5)
   - When only one door is available, it must be opened (implicit in the logic)
3. Probability calculations follow standard rules:
   - `P(win_keep)` = P(prize(1)) = 1/3
   - `P(win_switch)` = 1 - P(win_keep) = 2/3
4. No DeepProbLog features were used (neural network integration not required)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correctly handles deterministic door selection
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately models probability distributions
- **Edge cases**: Properly handles both scenarios for Monty's door opening

Potential improvements:
1. Make door selection probabilistic rather than fixed
2. Add validation for input parameters
3. Consider generalizing for N doors

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with appropriate probabilistic reasoning and produces the expected results. No errors were found in the current implementation.
