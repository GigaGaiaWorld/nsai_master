</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog: Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, which simulates a game show scenario where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host then opens a non-selected, non-prize door, and the player can choose to keep their original selection or switch. The implementation should correctly model the probabilistic nature of the host's door-opening behavior and calculate the winning probabilities for both strategies.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition. The error message indicates "No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:132", suggesting malformed conditional logic in the implementation.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Component**: The `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-12)
2. **Error Type**: Syntax error in conditional logic
3. **Specific Issue**: The if-then-else construct is improperly formatted, causing the parser to fail

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic for Monty's door selection is correct conceptually but syntactically invalid in ProbLog:
   - When two non-prize, non-selected doors exist, choose randomly (50/50)
   - When only one such door exists, Monty must open it

2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The implementation attempts to use probabilistic facts (0.5 probabilities) correctly but fails due to syntax issues

3. **Termination**: The recursive `member/2` predicate is correctly defined with proper base and recursive cases

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (member/2 works, but main logic fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Attempted but not functional due to syntax error
   - Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code doesn't handle cases where all doors might have prizes (invalid scenario)
   - No input validation for door numbers
   - The conditional logic structure is problematic

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed if-then-else syntax in open_door/1 | Complete failure | Rewrite using proper ProbLog conditional syntax |
| 2 | Missing whitespace in operator | Parser error | Add spaces around operators |
| 3 | Improper line breaks in predicate definition | Syntax error | Format clauses with proper line structure |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors),
    (
        Doors = [A,B] -> 
            0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)
    ;
        Doors = [A] -> 
            open_door(A)
    ).
```

The main issues preventing successful execution are purely syntactic. The logical structure of the solution is appropriate for modeling the Monty Hall problem, but the implementation needs proper ProbLog syntax for conditional statements and probabilistic facts. Once corrected, the implementation should properly calculate the different winning probabilities for keeping versus switching doors.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
