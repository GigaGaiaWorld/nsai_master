# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, where a player selects a door behind which may be a prize, and the host opens another door based on specific rules. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and implementation against the problem's requirements.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical error during evaluation:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:139
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error. The error occurs when trying to process the `open_door/1` predicate definition.

## 3. Failure Localization
The error originates from line 6 (character 139) in the `open_door/1` definition. The problematic code block is:
```prolog
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected), 
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors), 
    length(Doors, Len), 
    (Len =:= 2 -> member(D, Doors), 0.5::open_door(D) ; Len =:= 1 -> member(D, Doors), open_door(D)).
```

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs because:
1. The syntax for probabilistic facts is incorrectly used inside the deterministic rule body
2. The conditional structure is malformed - missing parentheses around the second branch
3. The recursive call to `open_door(D)` creates an infinite loop when `Len =:= 1`

Probabilistic rules violations:
- The `0.5::open_door(D)` is invalid syntax - probabilistic facts must be defined at the top level
- The negation `\+ prize(X)` in `findall` doesn't properly account for the probabilistic nature of `prize/1`

## 5. Overall Analysis
Functional requirements:
- Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but with syntax errors
- Probabilistic reasoning: Incorrect implementation of probabilistic choices
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases overlooked:
- Invalid probabilistic fact placement
- Malformed conditional structure
- Potential infinite recursion
- Probabilistic negation handling

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid probabilistic fact in rule body | Compilation error | Move probabilistic choices to top level |
| 2 | Malformed conditional structure | Syntax error | Add proper parentheses around branches |
| 3 | Infinite recursion risk | Runtime error | Remove recursive call, use different approach |
| 4 | Probabilistic negation handling | Incorrect probabilities | Use proper probabilistic negation methods |

## Recommended Fix
```prolog
% Probabilistic facts at top level
0.5::open_door_a(1); 0.5::open_door_a(2) :- 
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), [A,B]),
    select_door(Selected).

open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors),
    (Doors = [A,B] -> open_door_a(D)
    ; Doors = [A] -> D = A
    ).
```

This solution separates the probabilistic choice from the deterministic logic and handles both cases (1 or 2 available doors) correctly. The probabilistic choice is made at the top level when there are two available doors.
