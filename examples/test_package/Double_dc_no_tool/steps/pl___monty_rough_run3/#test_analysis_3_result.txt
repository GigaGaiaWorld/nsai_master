# Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog: Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, which simulates a game show scenario where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host then opens a non-selected, non-prize door, and the player can choose to keep their original selection or switch. The implementation should correctly model the probabilistic nature of the host's door-opening behavior and calculate the winning probabilities for both strategies.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition. The error message indicates "No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:132", suggesting malformed conditional logic in the implementation.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Component**: The `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-12)
2. **Error Type**: Syntax error in conditional logic
3. **Specific Issue**: The if-then-else construct is improperly formatted, causing the parser to fail

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic for Monty's door selection is correct conceptually but syntactically invalid in ProbLog:
   - When two non-prize, non-selected doors exist, choose randomly (50/50)
   - When only one such door exists, Monty must open it

2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The implementation attempts to use probabilistic facts (0.5 probabilities) correctly but fails due to syntax issues

3. **Termination**: The recursive `member/2` predicate is correctly defined with proper base and recursive cases

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (member/2 works, but main logic fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Attempted but not functional due to syntax error
   - Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code doesn't handle cases where all doors might have prizes (invalid scenario)
   - No input validation for door numbers
   - The conditional logic structure is problematic

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed if-then-else syntax in open_door/1 | Complete failure | Rewrite using proper ProbLog conditional syntax |
| 2 | Missing whitespace in operator | Parser error | Add spaces around operators |
| 3 | Improper line breaks in predicate definition | Syntax error | Format clauses with proper line structure |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors),
    (
        Doors = [A,B] -> 
            0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)
    ;
        Doors = [A] -> 
            open_door(A)
    ).
```

The main issues preventing successful execution are purely syntactic. The logical structure of the solution is appropriate for modeling the Monty Hall problem, but the implementation needs proper ProbLog syntax for conditional statements and probabilistic facts. Once corrected, the implementation should properly calculate the different winning probabilities for keeping versus switching doors.
