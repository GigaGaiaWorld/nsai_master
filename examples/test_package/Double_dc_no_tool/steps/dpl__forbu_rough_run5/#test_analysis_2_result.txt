# Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubble Sort Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, specifically examining the `bubblesort/3` predicate and its wrapper `forth_sort/2`. The code was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` but resulted in an execution error. The purpose is to identify the root cause of failure and verify compliance with Prolog/ProbLog requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The single test case failed with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 5:12.
```
No queries successfully executed, and no probability results were generated as the code failed during parsing/compilation.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate at line 5, specifically in the conditional expression:
```prolog
(X > Y ->
    bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted)
;
    bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted)
)
```
The ProbLog engine cannot process the Prolog-style conditional operator `->/2`.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Compatibility**: ProbLog uses a different syntax for conditionals than standard Prolog. The `->/2` operator is not natively supported in ProbLog's engine.
2. **Logical Structure**: While the bubble sort algorithm is logically correct for standard Prolog, it's not compatible with ProbLog's syntax requirements.
3. **Probabilistic Context**: The implementation doesn't include any probabilistic facts or rules, making it purely deterministic Prolog code.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3` or `tensor` operations) was attempted. "DeepProbLog feature not used".

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Compliance**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (algorithm is correct but incompatible syntax)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural integration: Not attempted

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input would cause type errors
   - Deep recursion could cause stack overflow for large lists
   - Empty list case is correctly handled
   - Singleton list case is correctly handled

3. **Main Issues**:
   - Syntax incompatibility with ProbLog
   - Missing probabilistic elements
   - No error handling for non-integer/non-comparable elements

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog incompatible conditional syntax | Code won't execute | Rewrite using ProbLog's `if/3` predicate |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Doesn't utilize ProbLog's features | Add probabilistic facts or rules |
| 3 | No type checking | May fail on non-list input | Add input validation |
| 4 | No neural integration | Not using DeepProbLog | Consider adding NN components if needed |

## Recommended Fixes
1. Replace the Prolog conditional with ProbLog's `if/3`:
```prolog
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    if(X > Y,
        bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted),
        bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted)
    ).
```

2. Consider adding probabilistic elements if sorting under uncertainty is required:
```prolog
0.8::gt(X,Y) :- X > Y.  % Uncertain comparison
```

3. Add input validation:
```prolog
forth_sort(L, L2) :- is_list(L), bubblesort(L, [], L2).
```

The current implementation shows good algorithmic structure but needs adaptation for ProbLog compatibility and could benefit from proper probabilistic extensions to fulfill ProbLog's intended use cases.
