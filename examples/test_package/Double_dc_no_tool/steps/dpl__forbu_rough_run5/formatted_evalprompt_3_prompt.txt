problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its functionality and identifying any issues in the code. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning since no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed with an error message indicating an unknown clause for the `->/2` operator. No successful test results were recorded.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at the conditional statement (line 4-7 in the code block). The Prolog interpreter cannot process the `->/2` operator in this context, suggesting either a syntax error or an unsupported operator in the current environment.

Key problematic sections:
- Lines 4-7: Conditional execution using `->/2` operator
- The entire `bubblesort/3` predicate depends on this conditional logic

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Analysis**:
   - The logical structure of the bubblesort algorithm is correctly implemented in principle
   - The recursive termination condition (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`) is properly defined
   - The issue stems from the syntax of the conditional statement, which may not be supported in all Prolog implementations

2. **ProbLog/DeepProbLog Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are present in the code
   - No neural network integration (DeepProbLog feature not used)
   - The error is purely syntactic and unrelated to probabilistic reasoning

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet functional requirements due to the syntax error. While the algorithm's logic appears correct, the conditional operator usage prevents successful execution.

Edge case considerations:
- Non-list input handling is not addressed
- Performance with deep recursion isn't optimized
- Empty list case is properly handled through the base case
- The implementation doesn't include any type checking

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unknown clause for `->/2` operator | Complete failure of execution | Replace with standard Prolog conditional syntax or verify environment support |
| 2 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors with non-list inputs | Add type checking predicates |
| 3 | No probabilistic features used | Limited to classical Prolog functionality | Consider adding probabilistic elements if needed |

```prolog
% Suggested alternative syntax for the conditional
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, [], NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped = true
     -> bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
     ;  append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)
    ).
```

The evaluation reveals that while the algorithm's logic is fundamentally sound, the implementation fails due to syntax issues with conditional statements. The code requires modification to use standard Prolog conditional syntax or verification of environment support for the current syntax. No probabilistic or neural network features were utilized in this implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
