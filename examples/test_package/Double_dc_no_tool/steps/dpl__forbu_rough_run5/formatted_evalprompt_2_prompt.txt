problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 5:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubble Sort Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, specifically examining the `bubblesort/3` predicate and its wrapper `forth_sort/2`. The code was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` but resulted in an execution error. The purpose is to identify the root cause of failure and verify compliance with Prolog/ProbLog requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The single test case failed with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 5:12.
```
No queries successfully executed, and no probability results were generated as the code failed during parsing/compilation.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate at line 5, specifically in the conditional expression:
```prolog
(X > Y ->
    bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted)
;
    bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted)
)
```
The ProbLog engine cannot process the Prolog-style conditional operator `->/2`.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Compatibility**: ProbLog uses a different syntax for conditionals than standard Prolog. The `->/2` operator is not natively supported in ProbLog's engine.
2. **Logical Structure**: While the bubble sort algorithm is logically correct for standard Prolog, it's not compatible with ProbLog's syntax requirements.
3. **Probabilistic Context**: The implementation doesn't include any probabilistic facts or rules, making it purely deterministic Prolog code.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3` or `tensor` operations) was attempted. "DeepProbLog feature not used".

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Compliance**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (algorithm is correct but incompatible syntax)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural integration: Not attempted

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input would cause type errors
   - Deep recursion could cause stack overflow for large lists
   - Empty list case is correctly handled
   - Singleton list case is correctly handled

3. **Main Issues**:
   - Syntax incompatibility with ProbLog
   - Missing probabilistic elements
   - No error handling for non-integer/non-comparable elements

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog incompatible conditional syntax | Code won't execute | Rewrite using ProbLog's `if/3` predicate |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements | Doesn't utilize ProbLog's features | Add probabilistic facts or rules |
| 3 | No type checking | May fail on non-list input | Add input validation |
| 4 | No neural integration | Not using DeepProbLog | Consider adding NN components if needed |

## Recommended Fixes
1. Replace the Prolog conditional with ProbLog's `if/3`:
```prolog
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    if(X > Y,
        bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted),
        bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted)
    ).
```

2. Consider adding probabilistic elements if sorting under uncertainty is required:
```prolog
0.8::gt(X,Y) :- X > Y.  % Uncertain comparison
```

3. Add input validation:
```prolog
forth_sort(L, L2) :- is_list(L), bubblesort(L, [], L2).
```

The current implementation shows good algorithmic structure but needs adaptation for ProbLog compatibility and could benefit from proper probabilistic extensions to fulfill ProbLog's intended use cases.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
