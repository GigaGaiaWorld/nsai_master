# Problog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Problog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm. The code should correctly sort lists using the classic bubblesort approach while being compatible with Problog's probabilistic reasoning framework. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, error handling, and Problog compatibility.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:19
```
The query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` could not be executed due to this syntax error in the implementation.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at line 4 (character 19) where the if-then-else construct `(Changed == 1 -> ... ; ...)` is not properly recognized by Problog. 

Key problematic components:
1. The if-then-else syntax (`->/2`) is not supported in standard Problog (lines 4-7)
2. The entire sorting logic depends on this conditional branching

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Compatibility**: Problog uses a different syntax for conditional statements than standard Prolog. The `->/2` operator is not recognized.
2. **Logical Structure**: While the bubblesort algorithm is logically correct for standard Prolog, it needs adaptation for Problog's syntax rules.
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: The implementation doesn't include any probabilistic facts or rules, making it purely deterministic.
4. **DeepProbLog Integration**: No neural network components (`nn/3`, `tensor`) are used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (algorithm is correct but syntax incompatible)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Empty list case is correctly handled
   - Performance with large lists not tested
   - No probabilistic facts or rules included

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported if-then-else syntax | Complete failure | Replace with Problog-compatible conditionals |
| 2 | No probabilistic components | Limited to deterministic sorting | Add probabilistic facts or rules |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for list inputs |
| 4 | No DeepProbLog integration | Missed opportunity for hybrid reasoning | Consider adding neural network components |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Problog-compatible bubblesort implementation
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Changed),
    (Changed =:= 1,
     bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
    (Changed =\= 1,
     append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)).
```

The implementation requires complete restructuring to use only Problog-supported syntax elements. The sorting logic itself is correct, but needs to be expressed in a way compatible with Problog's execution model.
