# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system models actuator selection, wind effects, and flap position control with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in the implementation.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probability distributions:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
- goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
- goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
- goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
- goal_reached(5) = 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities show a logical progression where:
1. The chance of reaching the goal decreases over time as more steps are needed
2. Overrun exceptions only appear after the first step and remain at low probabilities
3. All probabilities sum to valid values within the 0-1 range

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates function as intended:
- `flap_position/2` correctly handles legal positions (Hash: B79F5C58)
- `overrun_exception/1` properly detects illegal positions (Hash: E185A34B)
- `goal_reached/1` accurately checks goal achievement (Hash: 779B4ADF)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection follows the defined 50/50 distribution
2. Wind effects properly condition their probabilities on wind strength
3. The computation of `attempted_flap_position` correctly combines:
   - Actuator strength (discrete values)
   - Wind effect (probabilistic)
   - Goal direction (deterministic)

Probability rules are correctly implemented:
- All probabilistic facts sum to 1.0 within their contexts
- Negation is properly handled in the overrun condition
- Joint probabilities are correctly computed in the combined effects

**DeepProbLog Feature:** DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully met (deterministic position checking)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Fully met (actuator/wind probability handling)
- Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge Cases Verified:**
- Initial position (time=0) is properly handled
- Illegal positions correctly trigger exceptions
- Wind effects cover both positive and negative values
- All time steps up to the limit (5) are computed

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add validation for actuator strength values
2. Consider adding a maximum time limit guard
3. Could extend with failure probabilities for actuators

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The implementation correctly models the aircraft flap control system with proper probabilistic handling of actuator selection and wind effects. All test cases pass with logically consistent probability distributions.
