</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the classical Prolog implementation and assess its compliance with specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and handling of edge cases.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list and returns the expected output with full certainty (probability 1.0), which is appropriate for deterministic sorting in classical Prolog.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base case (empty list)
2. Recursive case (non-empty list)
3. Insertion of elements in sorted order

All predicates (`insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3`) function as intended without errors.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm correctly implements insertion sort by:
   - Recursively sorting the tail (line 2)
   - Inserting the head in the correct position (lines 4-7)
2. **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates properly when the input list is empty (line 1)

**ProbLog Analysis:**
1. The result shows probability 1.0, indicating deterministic behavior
2. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
3. The computation follows classical Prolog semantics

**DeepProbLog Check:** DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network calls or tensor operations present)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met - correctly implements insertion sort
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (pure classical Prolog implementation)
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list input:** Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)
2. **Deep recursion:** Performance may degrade with very long lists
3. **Mixed elements:** Works with comparable elements but may fail with mixed types
4. **Duplicate elements:** Handled correctly (maintains order of duplicates)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | Consider adding input validation for non-list cases |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | For probabilistic needs, explicit probability facts could be added |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Consider tail-recursive optimization for large lists |

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation is correct for its specified purpose as a classical Prolog insertion sort algorithm. For extended functionality (probabilistic or neural aspects), additional implementation would be required.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
