# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the classical Prolog implementation and assess its compliance with specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and handling of edge cases.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list and returns the expected output with full certainty (probability 1.0), which is appropriate for deterministic sorting in classical Prolog.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base case (empty list)
2. Recursive case (non-empty list)
3. Insertion of elements in sorted order

All predicates (`insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3`) function as intended without errors.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm correctly implements insertion sort by:
   - Recursively sorting the tail (line 2)
   - Inserting the head in the correct position (lines 4-7)
2. **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates properly when the input list is empty (line 1)

**ProbLog Analysis:**
1. The result shows probability 1.0, indicating deterministic behavior
2. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
3. The computation follows classical Prolog semantics

**DeepProbLog Check:** DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network calls or tensor operations present)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met - correctly implements insertion sort
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (pure classical Prolog implementation)
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list input:** Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)
2. **Deep recursion:** Performance may degrade with very long lists
3. **Mixed elements:** Works with comparable elements but may fail with mixed types
4. **Duplicate elements:** Handled correctly (maintains order of duplicates)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | Consider adding input validation for non-list cases |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | For probabilistic needs, explicit probability facts could be added |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Consider tail-recursive optimization for large lists |

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation is correct for its specified purpose as a classical Prolog insertion sort algorithm. For extended functionality (probabilistic or neural aspects), additional implementation would be required.
