</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates results between players, computes scores, and determines winners. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, test verification, and edge case analysis.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** 
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 as the winner with probability 1.0, which matches expected behavior:
- Round 1: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 2: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 3: rock beats scissor (player1 wins)
- Final score: -1 (player2 wins)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates are correctly defined:
1. `move/1` correctly declares all three gestures (lines 2-4)
2. `beats/2` properly defines all win-lose relationships (lines 7-9)
3. `result/3` handles all game outcomes (draw, win, lose) (lines 12-19)
4. `play/3` and `compute_score/2` correctly process move lists recursively (lines 22-32)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog aspects:
1. **Logical Correctness:** All rules follow correct game logic with proper termination conditions
2. **Recursive Termination:** Base cases are properly defined for both `play/3` (empty list) and `compute_score/2` (score 0)
3. **Probabilistic Rules:** Since no probabilistic facts are used, standard logical evaluation applies

**DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Classical reasoning: Fully met - correctly implements game rules and result calculation
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts)
3. Neural network integration: Not required

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty input lists handled by base cases
2. All possible move combinations covered by `beats/2`
3. Draw condition properly implemented in `result/3`

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for non-move atoms
2. Consider adding probabilistic versions of moves
3. Add tie-breaking mechanisms for extended games

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct | 

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation correctly models the rock-paper-scissors game with proper handling of all game scenarios. While currently limited to classical ProbLog features, it provides a solid foundation that could be extended with probabilistic or DeepProbLog components if needed.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
</Final_Answer>
