# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates results between players, computes scores, and determines winners. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, test verification, and edge case analysis.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** 
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 as the winner with probability 1.0, which matches expected behavior:
- Round 1: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 2: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Round 3: rock beats scissor (player1 wins)
- Final score: -1 (player2 wins)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates are correctly defined:
1. `move/1` correctly declares all three gestures (lines 2-4)
2. `beats/2` properly defines all win-lose relationships (lines 7-9)
3. `result/3` handles all game outcomes (draw, win, lose) (lines 12-19)
4. `play/3` and `compute_score/2` correctly process move lists recursively (lines 22-32)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog aspects:
1. **Logical Correctness:** All rules follow correct game logic with proper termination conditions
2. **Recursive Termination:** Base cases are properly defined for both `play/3` (empty list) and `compute_score/2` (score 0)
3. **Probabilistic Rules:** Since no probabilistic facts are used, standard logical evaluation applies

**DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Classical reasoning: Fully met - correctly implements game rules and result calculation
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts)
3. Neural network integration: Not required

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty input lists handled by base cases
2. All possible move combinations covered by `beats/2`
3. Draw condition properly implemented in `result/3`

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for non-move atoms
2. Consider adding probabilistic versions of moves
3. Add tie-breaking mechanisms for extended games

The implementation correctly models the rock-paper-scissors game with proper handling of all game scenarios. While currently limited to classical ProbLog features, it provides a solid foundation that could be extended with probabilistic or DeepProbLog components if needed.
