</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Insertion Sort Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The primary purpose is to verify the correctness of the sorting functionality and analyze its compliance with Prolog's logical programming paradigm. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning since no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with complete certainty (probability 1.0000).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base case for empty list (line 1)
2. Recursive case for list with head and tail (lines 2-3)
3. Insertion logic for all comparison cases (lines 4-8)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical Prolog:
1. **Logical Correctness:** The recursive decomposition and insertion operations follow standard insertion sort algorithm principles
2. **Termination:** The recursion terminates properly as each recursive call processes a shorter list until reaching the empty list base case
3. **Probabilistic Aspects:** Not applicable (pure classical Prolog implementation)
4. **DeepProbLog Features:** DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets the functional requirements for classical reasoning:
1. Correctly implements insertion sort algorithm
2. Handles the provided test case successfully
3. Maintains proper recursive structure

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list input:** The code doesn't explicitly handle non-list inputs (would fail with type error)
2. **Performance:** Recursive implementation may face stack issues with very long lists
3. **Duplicate elements:** The implementation correctly handles duplicates due to `=<` and `>` comparisons
4. **Empty list:** Explicitly handled by the base case

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No explicit type checking | May fail unexpectedly with non-list inputs | Add input validation |
| 2 | No tail recursion optimization | Potential stack overflow with large lists | Consider iterative implementation |
| 3 | No probabilistic features used | Limited to classical Prolog functionality | N/A (if not required) |

**Word Count:** 398 words

The implementation is correct for the tested case and demonstrates proper insertion sort logic, though could be enhanced with additional edge case handling and optimization considerations.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
