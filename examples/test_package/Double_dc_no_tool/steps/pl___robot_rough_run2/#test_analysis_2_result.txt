# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's key carrying behavior and movement between locations. The code combines probabilistic facts with logical rules to simulate realistic scenarios where actions may succeed or fail with given probabilities.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query probabilities:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4813
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6300
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3630
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0070
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities are consistent with the defined rules and probabilistic facts:
1. The carrying probability combines pickup success (0.7) with retention probabilities
2. Robot location probabilities follow the 90% success rate for goto actions
3. Key location probabilities properly combine robot movement with carrying status

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
- `carrying/2` (lines 1-6)
- `drops/2` (lines 10-14)
- `slippery/2` (lines 18-22)
- `at/3` (lines 27-37)
- Movement predicates (lines 27-33)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic calculations are correct:
1. Negation probabilities: `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is properly used in all negated conditions
2. Conjunction probabilities correctly multiply independent event probabilities
3. Recursive cases all have proper base cases (time=0) and termination
4. DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

Key probability calculations:
- `carrying` combines pickup success (0.7) with retention (0.8 × 0.4 = 0.32)
- `goto` actions follow the 0.9 success rate definition
- Key location combines robot movement with carrying status

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. Classical reasoning: Correctly models state transitions
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Accurately computes joint probabilities
3. Neural integration: Not required for this scenario

Edge cases handled:
1. Time=0 cases are properly defined for all predicates
2. Recursion depth is managed through time increments
3. All negations have defined positive cases

Potential improvements:
1. Add validation for position values
2. Consider adding max time limit for recursion
3. Could add more comments explaining probability calculations

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The code is well-structured and correctly implements the specified probabilistic logic scenario. All test cases pass with expected probability values, demonstrating correct implementation of both the logical rules and probabilistic calculations.
