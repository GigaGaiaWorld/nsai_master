# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that includes move definitions, result calculation, score computation, and winner determination. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and identify any implementation errors.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed to execute due to a syntax error in the code.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate implementation (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. An incomplete predicate definition before the query
2. Malformed if-then-else syntax in the final implementation

The problematic section shows:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :-
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; Winner = draw).</Code_Block>
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The code contains an incomplete predicate definition before the properly formatted version, causing parser confusion.
2. **Logical Structure**: The core logic (when properly formatted) is sound:
   - Correctly uses `play/3` to generate results
   - Properly computes scores with `compute_score/2`
   - Implements correct winner determination
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: The implementation currently uses only classical ProbLog features (no probabilistic facts or neural network integration).

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core logic works but syntax error prevents execution)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Uneven move lists would cause failure
   - Deep recursion not a concern for typical game lengths

3. **Correct Implementation** (when syntax fixed):
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Code cannot execute | Remove partial definition before complete one |
| 2 | Malformed if-then-else structure | Parser error | Ensure proper Prolog syntax for conditionals |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for move lists |

The implementation shows correct game logic but requires syntax correction to become functional. The core rules for moves, beating relationships, and result calculation are properly defined. With the syntax fixes, this would correctly implement classical rock-paper-scissors gameplay in ProbLog.
