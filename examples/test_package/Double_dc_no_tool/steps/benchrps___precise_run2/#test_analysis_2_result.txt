# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code should determine the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, predicate definitions, and error handling.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test query provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

The test failed with the error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition - the predicate body was cut off in the middle
2. Syntax error in the conditional statement implementation
3. The correct implementation (provided in the `<Langda>` block) wasn't properly integrated

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues are:

1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
- The `determine_winner` predicate is incomplete in the main code
- The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct
- Logical relationships in `beats/2` and `result/3` are properly defined

2. **ProbLog Specifics**:
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- The code is purely deterministic classical Prolog
- DeepProbLog features are not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Basic game logic is correctly implemented in `beats/2` and `result/3`
- The list processing in `play/3` is structurally sound
- Score computation in `compute_score/2` follows correct logic
- The main predicate (`determine_winner`) is incomplete, preventing successful execution

**Edge Cases**:
- Non-list inputs aren't handled
- Unequal length move lists would cause failure
- Undefined moves would fail silently in `result/3`

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete `determine_winner` predicate | Code cannot execute | Use the complete implementation from the `<Langda>` block |
| 2 | Syntax error in conditional | Parser failure | Fix the if-then-else structure |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for move lists |

**Correct Implementation**:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

The code shows good structure for the game logic but fails due to the incomplete main predicate. The solution is to properly integrate the complete `determine_winner` implementation as shown above. After this fix, the test case should correctly return `Winner = 'Player 2'` since paper beats rock in two rounds and scissors loses to rock in one round, resulting in a net score of -1.
