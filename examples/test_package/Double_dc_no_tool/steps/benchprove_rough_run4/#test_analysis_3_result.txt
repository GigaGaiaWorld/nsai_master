# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The code includes basic predicates like `member/2` and several extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) as required. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning principles.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries failed due to a critical error in the implementation. The system reported: "No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 16:35". This indicates the meta-interpreter cannot process the `implies/2` predicate correctly.

## Failure Localization
1. **Primary Error**: 
   - Location: Line containing `prove(implies(A, B)) :- (prove(A) -> prove(B); true).`
   - Problem: ProbLog cannot process the Prolog `->/2` operator directly in this context
   - Impact: All implication-based queries fail

2. **Affected Queries**:
   - `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` - Failed
   - `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` - Failed (missing implementation)
   - `prove(expand(double(3),6))` - Failed (missing implementation)
   - `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` - Failed (missing implementation)
   - `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` - Failed (missing implementation)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Issues**:
   - The meta-interpreter cannot handle Prolog's control structures (`->/2`)
   - Missing implementations for required predicates (`opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.)
   - No recursive termination checks for potential infinite recursion cases

2. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are defined in the program
   - Missing implementations for probabilistic operations (negations, implications)
   - The current implementation doesn't comply with `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but non-functional
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: Not implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined `expand/2` cases not handled
   - No type checking for list operations
   - No protection against infinite recursion
   - Missing implementations for most required predicates

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Cannot process `->/2` operator | All implication queries fail | Rewrite `implies/2` using pure ProbLog |
| 2 | Missing predicate implementations | All extended queries fail | Implement all required predicates |
| 3 | No probabilistic handling | Cannot compute probabilities | Add probabilistic facts/rules |
| 4 | No type checking | May fail on invalid inputs | Add input validation |

```prolog
% Suggested fix for implies/2
prove(implies(A, B)) :-
    prove(not(A)); prove(A), prove(B).
```

The implementation requires significant revision to meet all requirements. The meta-interpreter structure is fundamentally sound but needs complete predicate implementations and proper ProbLog-compatible control flow handling.
