  "ErrorSummary": "The provided implementation in the Langda block is correct, but it's not properly integrated into the main code. The main code shows an incomplete predicate definition.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the incomplete 'determine_winner/3' predicate in the main code with the correct implementation from the Langda block. The correct implementation should be: determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').",
