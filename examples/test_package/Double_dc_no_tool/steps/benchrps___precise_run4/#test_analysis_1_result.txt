# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines move relationships, win/lose conditions, and scoring logic to determine the winner between two players. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test case coverage, and proper handling of probabilistic reasoning where applicable.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W))` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 44:16
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate implementation. The issue stems from:
1. An incomplete predicate definition (line 44) where the arrow operator `->` is not properly formatted
2. Missing proper termination of the predicate with a period before the query

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented
2. The logical relationships between moves (`beats/2`) are properly defined
3. The scoring logic correctly implements win/lose/draw conditions (hash FB0E8901 and 133D6BEE verify this)

The error is purely syntactic - the `determine_winner` predicate isn't properly closed before the query begins. ProbLog cannot parse the incomplete predicate definition.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but top predicate fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not used in this implementation
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases:**
1. Non-list inputs would cause type errors
2. Uneven move lists would cause failure
3. The current error prevents any successful execution

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Entire program fails to run | Properly terminate the determine_winner predicate with a period |
| 2 | Query mixed with code | Syntax error | Separate query from predicate definitions |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Limited functionality | Consider adding move probabilities if desired |

**Corrected Code Block:**
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1;
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2;
     Winner = draw).
```

The core game logic appears sound, but the implementation error prevents successful execution. Fixing the syntax would allow proper testing of the actual game mechanics.
