# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The code should correctly calculate round results and determine the overall winner.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate implementation. The specific issue is:
- Line 41: The predicate definition is incomplete (cut off mid-implementation)
- The correct implementation (provided in the Langda block) wasn't properly integrated into the main code

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The main predicate `determine_winner/3` is syntactically incomplete
   - The recursive predicates `play/3` and `compute_score/2` are correctly defined with proper termination conditions
   - The basic game rules (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`) are correctly implemented

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The report "DeepProbLog feature not used" as there are no neural network integrations

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning requirements are partially met (core game logic works but main predicate is broken)
   - Probabilistic reasoning requirements are not applicable
   - Neural network integration is not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs aren't handled
   - Unequal length move lists aren't checked
   - Invalid moves aren't validated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete `determine_winner` predicate | Critical failure | Integrate the correct implementation from Langda block |
| 2 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation and length checking |
| 3 | No error handling | Unclear failures | Add failure cases for invalid inputs |

```prolog
% Correct implementation should be:
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

The core game logic is sound, but the main interface predicate needs to be properly implemented. Once fixed, the system should correctly determine winners from move sequences. The implementation would benefit from additional input validation and error handling.
