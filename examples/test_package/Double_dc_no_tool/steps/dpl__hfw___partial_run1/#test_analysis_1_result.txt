# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Number Detection and Expression Evaluation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to:
1. Detect numbers (0-9) from image representations
2. Detect basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
3. Parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from sequences of detected numbers and operators

The system uses classical Prolog-style reasoning with some probabilistic elements (as evidenced by probability values in results).

## Test Results Summary
The system was tested with one main query:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:**
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],-10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
The expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` evaluates to:
1. Parentheses first: 3 + 3 = 6
2. Division: 2 / 6 ≈ 0.333...
3. Multiplication: 2 * 7 = 14
4. Final subtraction: 0.333... - 14 ≈ -13.666...

**Discrepancy Found:**
The system returned -10.333... instead of the expected -13.666...

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the parsing of subtraction operations. The relevant rule is:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse([-1, *|T], R2),
 almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
```

This implementation incorrectly transforms `A - B` into `A + (-1 * B)` but then mishandles the operator precedence in complex expressions.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error**: The subtraction rule doesn't properly maintain expression structure during parsing
2. **Precedence Handling**: The current implementation doesn't fully respect arithmetic operator precedence
3. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion is properly structured but computes incorrect values
4. **Probabilistic Aspect**: All probabilities are 1.0, indicating this is purely deterministic reasoning
5. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration detected ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (basic operations work but subtraction is flawed)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not significantly utilized
- Neural network integration: Not present

**Edge Cases Not Handled:**
1. Division by zero (though there's a check `N2 \== 0`)
2. Non-list inputs to `detect_all/2`
3. Malformed expressions (like operators at start/end)
4. Unrecognized image tokens

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect subtraction handling | Wrong calculation results | Rewrite subtraction rule to properly maintain expression structure |
| 2 | Operator precedence not fully respected | Incorrect evaluation order | Implement proper precedence handling or use parenthetical grouping |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for input lists |
| 4 | Limited error handling | Silent failures on bad input | Add more comprehensive error checking |

**Recommendations:**
1. Rewrite the subtraction rule to directly compute `N1 - R2`
2. Consider implementing proper operator precedence handling
3. Add more input validation and error cases
4. Expand test cases to cover more complex expressions and edge cases

The system shows promise but requires correction in its arithmetic evaluation logic, particularly for subtraction operations in complex expressions.
