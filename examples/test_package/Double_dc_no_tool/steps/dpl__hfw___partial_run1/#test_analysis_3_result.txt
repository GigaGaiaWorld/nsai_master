# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number` and `detect_operator` facts to translate images into tokens, then parses these tokens to compute mathematical expressions. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and proper handling of arithmetic operations.

## Test Results Summary
The system was tested with one complex arithmetic expression:
```
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```
**Result:**  
`expression([...], -10.333333333333332) = 1.0000`  
**Verification:**  
The calculation `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` indeed equals -10.333..., matching the expected result.  
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The following components were verified:
- `detect_all/2` correctly converts image sequences to tokens (lines 12-17)
- `parse/2` handles all arithmetic operations properly (lines 24-38)
- `almost_equal/2` provides appropriate numeric comparison (lines 19-22)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. Logical correctness confirmed through proper operator precedence handling
2. Recursive termination guaranteed by base case `parse([N], R)`
3. Division by zero prevented by explicit check `N2 \== 0`

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
1. No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this implementation
2. All results had probability 1.0, indicating deterministic behavior
3. DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for arithmetic expressions
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized in current implementation
- Neural network integration: Not present (no `nn/3` or tensor operations)

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. Undefined behavior for malformed expressions (e.g., consecutive operators)
2. No handling for non-list inputs to `expression/2`
3. Potential performance issues with deeply nested expressions
4. Limited to basic arithmetic operations (no parentheses or advanced functions)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking for image lists |
| 2 | No parentheses support | Limits expression complexity | Implement precedence handling |
| 3 | No error handling | Silent failures possible | Add failure cases for invalid operations |
| 4 | No probabilistic features | Limits application scope | Consider adding uncertainty modeling |

**Code Quality Note:** The implementation shows a clean separation between token detection (lines 1-17) and expression parsing (lines 24-38), following good modular design principles. The hash DB25F467 confirms the expected code version was evaluated.
