# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to translate images into mathematical tokens, then processes them through a recursive parser. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the expression evaluation and identify any potential issues in the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided evaluates the expression:  
`2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`  
which should yield `-13.666...` as the result.

**Test Result:**  
`expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], -10.333333333333332) = 1.0000`

**Verdict:** Test **failed**  
Expected result: `-13.666...`  
Actual result: `-10.333...`

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the subtraction handling within the `parse/2` predicate (lines containing the subtraction rule). The current implementation:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
    parse([-1, *|T], R2),
    almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
```
incorrectly transforms `a - b` into `a + (-1 * b)` instead of properly handling operator precedence.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error**: The subtraction rule doesn't maintain proper arithmetic precedence, causing operations to be evaluated left-to-right without considering operator priority.
2. **Recursive Processing**: While the recursion itself is sound, the transformation of subtraction operations disrupts the expected evaluation order.
3. **Probabilistic Aspect**: The program currently uses no probabilistic facts or neural network integration ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: 
   - Classical reasoning partially works but fails on complex expressions
   - Probabilistic reasoning not implemented
   - Neural network integration not present

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Division by zero is properly handled
   - Non-list inputs would cause failures
   - Deep recursion could cause stack overflow for very long expressions

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect subtraction handling | Wrong calculation results | Rewrite subtraction rule to maintain proper precedence |
| 2 | No operator precedence handling | Incorrect evaluation order | Implement proper precedence handling with parentheses support |
| 3 | No input validation | Crashes on invalid input | Add type checking for image lists |

**Recommendation**: The parser needs significant revision to properly handle operator precedence, either through:
1. Implementing a proper shunting-yard algorithm, or
2. Transforming the expression into proper parse tree structure before evaluation

The current implementation can only correctly evaluate completely left-associative expressions without operator precedence considerations.
