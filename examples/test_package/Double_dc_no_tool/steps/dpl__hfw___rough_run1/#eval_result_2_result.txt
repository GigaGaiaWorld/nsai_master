  "ErrorSummary": "Non-ground arithmetic comparisons in parse/2 rules causing CallModeError. Missing division by zero check.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Restructure parse/2 rules to ensure ground terms before comparison. Example fix for division:\nparse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :-\n    N2 =\\= 0,\n    Res is N1 / N2,\n    parse([Res | T], R).\nSimilar changes needed for other operations (+,-,*). Also modify almost_equal/2 to require ground terms.",
