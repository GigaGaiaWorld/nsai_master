# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, then computes the result of the arithmetic expression. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, error handling, and compliance with ProbLog's operational requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test case `query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X))` failed with a CallModeError. The error occurs when comparing floating-point results using the `almost_equal/2` predicate.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: 
   ```prolog
   expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)
   ```
2. **Error Location**: 
   - Line 23 (in `almost_equal/2` predicate)
   - The error occurs when trying to compare non-ground arithmetic expressions using `abs/1`

3. **Problematic Code**:
   ```prolog
   almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
     ground(Y), 
     abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.  % Fails when X is not ground
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Issue**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate attempts to compare values before they are fully instantiated, violating ProbLog's requirement for ground terms in arithmetic comparisons.
2. **Probabilistic Compliance**: The program doesn't use probabilistic facts or neural network integration (DeepProbLog features not used).
3. **Recursive Termination**: The recursive parsing logic is structurally sound but fails due to the comparison issue.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning partially works but fails on floating-point comparisons
   - Probabilistic reasoning not implemented
   - Neural network integration not required/used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Division by zero is properly handled
   - Non-list inputs would cause failure
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with very long expressions

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground arithmetic comparison | Prevents expression evaluation | Restructure `almost_equal/2` to ensure ground terms |
| 2 | Floating-point precision handling | Incorrect comparisons | Use ProbLog's built-in comparison operators |
| 3 | Error propagation | Unclear error messages | Add validation predicates |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Revised almost_equal/2 predicate
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), ground(Y), 
    float(X) - float(Y) < 0.0001,
    float(Y) - float(X) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(Y), 
    Y = float(X).
```

The main issue stems from attempting to perform arithmetic comparisons before all variables are properly instantiated. The solution requires ensuring all terms are ground before comparison while maintaining the floating-point precision checking functionality.

The evaluation shows the core logic is sound but requires proper handling of ProbLog's operational constraints regarding ground terms in arithmetic operations. With the suggested fixes, the expression parser should function correctly for all valid arithmetic expressions.
