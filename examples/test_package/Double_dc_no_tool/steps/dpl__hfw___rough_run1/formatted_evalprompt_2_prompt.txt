</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, converts them to symbols, then parses the expression using recursive arithmetic operations. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, error handling, and compliance with ProbLog's operational requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical failure during testing:
- Query: `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)`
- Error: `CallModeError` for `</2` operation due to non-ground arguments in `almost_equal/2`

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `almost_equal/2` predicate (line 23) when processing division operations. The specific issues are:

1. **Error Location**: 
   - Predicate: `almost_equal/2` (lines 22-26)
   - Called from: All `parse/2` rules for arithmetic operations (lines in Code_Block)

2. **Problem**: 
   - The predicate attempts to compare non-ground variables using `abs(X-Y) < 0.0001` before ensuring both arguments are ground
   - Violates ProbLog's requirement that arithmetic comparisons require ground terms

## Root Cause Analysis

### Classical Prolog Issues
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The recursive parsing logic is structurally sound but fails due to evaluation order
   - The `almost_equal` check should occur *after* arithmetic computation

2. **Termination**:
   - Recursion is properly structured with base case (`parse([N], R)`)
   - No risk of infinite recursion with valid input lists

### ProbLog Specific Issues
1. **Probability Handling**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are present in this implementation
   - The `almost_equal` predicate doesn't account for possible uncertainty in neural network outputs

2. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog features not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` operations)
   - Pure symbolic processing without neural network integration

## Overall Analysis

### Requirements Met
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Basic expression parsing is implemented for all four operations
   - Image-to-symbol conversion works correctly
   - Recursive evaluation structure is properly designed

2. **Missing Elements**:
   - No handling of probabilistic inputs or neural network uncertainty
   - No error handling for malformed expressions

### Edge Cases
1. **Critical Oversights**:
   - Non-ground arithmetic comparisons
   - No input validation for empty lists or invalid sequences
   - No handling of division by zero

2. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Recursion depth equals expression length (acceptable for typical expressions)
   - No memoization of intermediate results

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground arithmetic in almost_equal | Prevents evaluation | Restructure to ensure ground terms before comparison |
| 2 | No division by zero handling | Potential runtime error | Add validation before division |
| 3 | No input validation | May crash on malformed input | Add list structure checks |
| 4 | No probabilistic handling | Limited to crisp logic | Consider adding probability annotations |

## Corrective Recommendations

```prolog
% Revised almost_equal/2 predicate
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), ground(Y), 
    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(Y), 
    ground(X), 
    Y is float(X).

% Revised parse/2 for operations (example for division)
parse([N1, /, N2 | T], R) :-
    N2 =\= 0,  % Division by zero check
    Res is N1 / N2,
    parse([Res | T], R).
```

The primary issue stems from attempting arithmetic comparisons before ensuring ground terms. The solution requires restructuring the evaluation flow to ensure all arithmetic operands are ground before comparison operations. The revised version properly sequences the computation and comparison steps while adding essential safety checks.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
