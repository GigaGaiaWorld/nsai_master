</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, then computes the result of the arithmetic expression. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, error handling, and compliance with ProbLog's operational requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test case `query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X))` failed with a CallModeError. The error occurs when comparing floating-point results using the `almost_equal/2` predicate.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: 
   ```prolog
   expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)
   ```
2. **Error Location**: 
   - Line 23 (in `almost_equal/2` predicate)
   - The error occurs when trying to compare non-ground arithmetic expressions using `abs/1`

3. **Problematic Code**:
   ```prolog
   almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
     ground(Y), 
     abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.  % Fails when X is not ground
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Issue**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate attempts to compare values before they are fully instantiated, violating ProbLog's requirement for ground terms in arithmetic comparisons.
2. **Probabilistic Compliance**: The program doesn't use probabilistic facts or neural network integration (DeepProbLog features not used).
3. **Recursive Termination**: The recursive parsing logic is structurally sound but fails due to the comparison issue.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning partially works but fails on floating-point comparisons
   - Probabilistic reasoning not implemented
   - Neural network integration not required/used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Division by zero is properly handled
   - Non-list inputs would cause failure
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with very long expressions

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground arithmetic comparison | Prevents expression evaluation | Restructure `almost_equal/2` to ensure ground terms |
| 2 | Floating-point precision handling | Incorrect comparisons | Use ProbLog's built-in comparison operators |
| 3 | Error propagation | Unclear error messages | Add validation predicates |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Revised almost_equal/2 predicate
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), ground(Y), 
    float(X) - float(Y) < 0.0001,
    float(Y) - float(X) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(Y), 
    Y = float(X).
```

The main issue stems from attempting to perform arithmetic comparisons before all variables are properly instantiated. The solution requires ensuring all terms are ground before comparison while maintaining the floating-point precision checking functionality.

The evaluation shows the core logic is sound but requires proper handling of ProbLog's operational constraints regarding ground terms in arithmetic operations. With the suggested fixes, the expression parser should function correctly for all valid arithmetic expressions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
