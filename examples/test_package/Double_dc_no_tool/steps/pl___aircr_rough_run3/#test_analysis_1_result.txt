# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position changes over time considering actuator choices and wind effects. The system should calculate probabilities of reaching the target position (4) from initial position (6) within 5 steps, while detecting potential overrun exceptions.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The code fails to compile due to a syntax error in the parser:
```
problog.parser.ParseError: Expected binary operator at 33:200
```
No queries could be executed due to this compilation failure.

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate where the ternary conditional operator syntax is incorrect for ProbLog. The problematic section is:
```prolog
Pos is PrevPos + (Target > PrevPos ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect
```

ProbLog doesn't support the C-style ternary operator (`? :`). This needs to be rewritten using standard Prolog conditional constructs.

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue is syntactic incompatibility:
1. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic (adjusting position based on target direction, actuator strength, and wind effect) is sound
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The probability distributions for actuators and wind effects are correctly specified
3. **Termination**: The recursion is properly bounded by the `at(5)` constraint

The error prevents any probabilistic evaluation from occurring, though the model appears to correctly specify:
- Prior probabilities for actuator selection (50/50)
- Wind strength distributions (weak/strong with different effect distributions)
- Proper handling of legal/illegal positions

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (logical structure is correct but syntax prevents execution)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly specified but not testable due to syntax error
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases:**
1. The model doesn't explicitly handle cases where wind effect could cause multiple illegal positions
2. No validation for actuator strength values
3. The time-bound constraint (`at(5)`) prevents infinite recursion

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid ternary operator syntax | Compilation failure | Replace with Prolog's `-> ;` conditional |
| 2 | No test results available | Cannot verify probabilities | Fix syntax first |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog integration | Limited to basic ProbLog | Consider neural wind prediction |

**Recommended Fix:**
```prolog
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time-1,
    flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time,Actuator),
    actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),
    goal(Target),
    wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),
    (Target > PrevPos -> 
        DirectionChange = Strength
    ; 
        DirectionChange = -Strength
    ),
    Pos is PrevPos + DirectionChange + WindEffect.
```

The model shows good potential but requires syntax correction before proper evaluation. The probabilistic framework is appropriately structured for the described scenario once the syntax issue is resolved.
