<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position changes over time considering actuator choices and wind effects. The system should calculate probabilities of reaching the target position (4) from initial position (6) within 5 steps, while detecting potential overrun exceptions.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The code fails to compile due to a syntax error in the parser:
```
problog.parser.ParseError: Expected binary operator at 33:200
```
No queries could be executed due to this compilation failure.

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate where the ternary conditional operator syntax is incorrect for ProbLog. The problematic section is:
```prolog
Pos is PrevPos + (Target > PrevPos ? Strength : -Strength) + WindEffect
```

ProbLog doesn't support the C-style ternary operator (`? :`). This needs to be rewritten using standard Prolog conditional constructs.

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue is syntactic incompatibility:
1. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic (adjusting position based on target direction, actuator strength, and wind effect) is sound
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The probability distributions for actuators and wind effects are correctly specified
3. **Termination**: The recursion is properly bounded by the `at(5)` constraint

The error prevents any probabilistic evaluation from occurring, though the model appears to correctly specify:
- Prior probabilities for actuator selection (50/50)
- Wind strength distributions (weak/strong with different effect distributions)
- Proper handling of legal/illegal positions

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (logical structure is correct but syntax prevents execution)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly specified but not testable due to syntax error
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases:**
1. The model doesn't explicitly handle cases where wind effect could cause multiple illegal positions
2. No validation for actuator strength values
3. The time-bound constraint (`at(5)`) prevents infinite recursion

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid ternary operator syntax | Compilation failure | Replace with Prolog's `-> ;` conditional |
| 2 | No test results available | Cannot verify probabilities | Fix syntax first |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog integration | Limited to basic ProbLog | Consider neural wind prediction |

**Recommended Fix:**
```prolog
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time-1,
    flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time,Actuator),
    actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),
    goal(Target),
    wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),
    (Target > PrevPos -> 
        DirectionChange = Strength
    ; 
        DirectionChange = -Strength
    ),
    Pos is PrevPos + DirectionChange + WindEffect.
```

The model shows good potential but requires syntax correction before proper evaluation. The probabilistic framework is appropriately structured for the described scenario once the syntax issue is resolved.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
