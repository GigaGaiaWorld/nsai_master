# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under wind effects using probabilistic actuators. The system aims to move flaps from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps while handling potential overrun exceptions.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test queries executed successfully with the following probability distributions:

**Goal Achievement Probabilities:**
- `goal_reached(1)`: 26.25%
- `goal_reached(2)`: 18.73%
- `goal_reached(3)`: 12.69%
- `goal_reached(4)`: 8.41%
- `goal_reached(5)`: 5.70%

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- `overrun_exception(1)`: 0.00%
- `overrun_exception(2)`: 0.30%
- `overrun_exception(3)`: 1.10%
- `overrun_exception(4)`: 1.27%
- `overrun_exception(5)`: 1.14%

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities follow expected patterns where goal achievement likelihood decreases over time while overrun risks emerge after initial steps.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Actuator selection (50/50 probability)
2. Wind effect distributions (weak/strong with appropriate offsets)
3. Position boundary checks (legal_flap_position/1)
4. Goal condition verification

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The recursive position calculation (lines 20-23) properly considers:
  - Previous position (`flap_position(Prev,PrevPos)`)
  - Actuator strength (`actuator_strength/2`)
  - Wind effects (`wind_effect/2`)
  - Direction calculation (`sign(Target - PrevPos)`)

**Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**
- Actuator selection: Proper 50/50 distribution via `0.5::use_actuator(T,a); 0.5::use_actuator(T,b)`
- Wind model: Correct conditional probabilities for weak/strong wind scenarios
- Negation: Proper use of `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` for overrun detection

**DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for position tracking
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correct handling of actuator/wind uncertainties
- Neural integration: Not applicable (no `nn/3` or tensor operations)

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. Boundary handling: Legal position check prevents invalid states
2. Wind extremes: Model accounts for strong wind offsets (Â±3)
3. Time termination: Fixed at 5 steps prevents infinite recursion
4. Actuator fallback: No single-point failure (two actuators available)

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

**Code Quality Note:** The implementation would benefit from adding:
1. Comments explaining the wind effect probability distributions
2. A safety margin check for near-boundary positions
3. Visualization predicates for debugging trajectories
