# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using recursive list processing. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, logical structure, and compliance with ProbLog requirements.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Test Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list and returns the expected output with full probability (1.0000).

## 3. Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation correctly:
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (requirement 1)
2. Inserts the head element into the sorted list (requirement 2)

The base case (`insertion_sort([], [])`) and recursive case are both properly implemented.

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The classical Prolog implementation correctly follows insertion sort logic:
  - Base case handles empty lists (line 1)
  - Recursive case splits list into head/tail (line 2)
  - `insert_element/3` properly handles element insertion (lines 4-8)

**Probabilistic Aspects:**
- The deterministic nature of sorting yields probability 1.0000
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are utilized

**Termination:**
- Recursion terminates properly as each call processes a shorter list
- All clauses are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (deterministic sorting)
- Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

**Edge Cases Considered:**
- Empty list: Handled by base case
- Single-element list: Handled through recursive path
- Already sorted list: Correctly handled by insertion logic
- Duplicate elements: Properly maintained (test case doesn't verify)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add tests for edge cases (duplicates, single-element, pre-sorted lists)
2. Consider adding probabilistic elements if needed
3. Add input validation for non-list inputs

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No probabilistic features used | Limited ProbLog utilization | Consider adding probabilistic sorting rules if needed |
| 2 | Limited test coverage | Potential undetected edge cases | Add tests for duplicates, pre-sorted lists |
| 3 | No input validation | May fail on non-list inputs | Add type checking for list inputs |
