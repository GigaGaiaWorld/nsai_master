# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of constraints involving nationalities, pets, drinks, and other attributes. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and its adherence to ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with a single query:
```prolog
query(zebra(Houses)).
```

**Result:**
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as evidenced by the complete and consistent house arrangement returned with probability 1.0.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and function as expected.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The classical Prolog constraints are correctly implemented, with proper use of list membership checks (`my_member/2`) and positional relationships (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`).
   - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) correctly terminate when the element is found or the list is exhausted.

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The solution uses no probabilistic facts or rules, operating purely in deterministic mode (all probabilities are 1.0).
   - No DeepProbLog features (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used, as this is a purely logical puzzle.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All constraints are correctly implemented and solved.
   - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules used).
   - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code assumes valid list inputs for `houses/1`. Non-list inputs would cause errors but are not relevant for this puzzle context.
   - Recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and complete for solving the Zebra Puzzle using classical ProbLog reasoning. No errors or improvements were identified.
