# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on the correctness of game rules implementation, outcome determination, and score calculation. The analysis verifies classical logical reasoning without probabilistic elements or neural network integration.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Returned the correct result:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The implementation correctly:
1. Identifies win/lose/draw outcomes for each move pair
2. Calculates the aggregate score
3. Determines the final winner

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following predicates were verified:
- `move/1` (lines 3-5): Correctly defines valid moves
- `beats/2` (lines 7-9): Correctly implements game rules
- `outcome/3` (lines 13-15): Correctly determines game outcomes
- `play/3` (lines 17-20): Properly processes move lists
- `compute_score/2` (lines 22-25): Accurately calculates scores
- `determine_winner/3` (lines 26-31): Correctly identifies the winner

## Root Cause Analysis
The classical Prolog implementation shows correct:
1. **Logical correctness**: All rules properly implement rock-paper-scissors semantics
2. **Recursive termination**: Base cases properly terminate list processing
3. **Score calculation**: Win/lose/draw outcomes correctly affect the score

Probabilistic aspects were not used in this implementation. The result shows probability 1.0000 because this is a deterministic calculation in classical Prolog.

**DeepProbLog feature not used**

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for classical reasoning about the rock-paper-scissors game. Edge cases considered:
1. **Empty lists**: Handled by base case in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`
2. **Draw situations**: Correctly identified when moves are equal
3. **List length mismatch**: Not explicitly handled but Prolog would fail if lists are unequal length

Potential improvements:
1. Add input validation for move legality
2. Handle unequal length move lists
3. Add type checking for input parameters

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
