</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on the correctness of game rules implementation, outcome determination, and score calculation. The analysis verifies classical logical reasoning without probabilistic elements or neural network integration.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Returned the correct result:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The implementation correctly:
1. Identifies win/lose/draw outcomes for each move pair
2. Calculates the aggregate score
3. Determines the final winner

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following predicates were verified:
- `move/1` (lines 3-5): Correctly defines valid moves
- `beats/2` (lines 7-9): Correctly implements game rules
- `outcome/3` (lines 13-15): Correctly determines game outcomes
- `play/3` (lines 17-20): Properly processes move lists
- `compute_score/2` (lines 22-25): Accurately calculates scores
- `determine_winner/3` (lines 26-31): Correctly identifies the winner

## Root Cause Analysis
The classical Prolog implementation shows correct:
1. **Logical correctness**: All rules properly implement rock-paper-scissors semantics
2. **Recursive termination**: Base cases properly terminate list processing
3. **Score calculation**: Win/lose/draw outcomes correctly affect the score

Probabilistic aspects were not used in this implementation. The result shows probability 1.0000 because this is a deterministic calculation in classical Prolog.

**DeepProbLog feature not used**

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for classical reasoning about the rock-paper-scissors game. Edge cases considered:
1. **Empty lists**: Handled by base case in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`
2. **Draw situations**: Correctly identified when moves are equal
3. **List length mismatch**: Not explicitly handled but Prolog would fail if lists are unequal length

Potential improvements:
1. Add input validation for move legality
2. Handle unequal length move lists
3. Add type checking for input parameters

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The implementation is correct for the given requirements and test case. No errors were found in the evaluation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
