# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Digit Addition

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to perform simple digit addition using image identifiers. The program consists of digit facts (img_1 to img_0) and an addition rule that sums the corresponding digits. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, requirement compliance, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The program was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
```
**Result:**
```
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows that adding the digits represented by img_5 (5) and img_6 (6) yields 11 with 100% probability.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The program successfully:
1. Maps all image identifiers to their correct digits (img_1 to img_0)
2. Implements the addition logic correctly
3. Returns the expected sum with proper probability

## Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The digit/2 facts are properly defined for all cases (0-9)
- The addition/3 rule correctly retrieves digit values and performs arithmetic
- No recursion is used, so termination is guaranteed

**Probabilistic Aspects:**
- Since all facts are deterministic (probability 1.0), the probabilistic rules simplify to classical logic
- The computation follows P(Aâˆ§B) = P(A)*P(B) where both P(A) and P(B) are 1.0
- No negations or implications are used in this simple program

**DeepProbLog Integration:**
DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network calls or tensor operations present)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Properly handles deterministic facts
- Neural network integration: Not required/implemented

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. All digits (0-9) are properly defined
2. The addition handles all valid combinations
3. No list inputs or complex structures are involved

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Could add input validation for non-existent image IDs
2. Could extend to handle probabilistic digit recognition
3. Could add error handling for non-numeric results

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

The program meets all specified requirements with correct implementation. The test case verifies basic functionality, though additional test cases covering all digit combinations would provide more comprehensive validation. The simple deterministic nature of the current implementation limits potential errors, but also limits the demonstration of ProbLog's full probabilistic capabilities.
