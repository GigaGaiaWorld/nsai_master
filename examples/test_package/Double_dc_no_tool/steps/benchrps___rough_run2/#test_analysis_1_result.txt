# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning aspects. The code defines game rules, outcome determination, and scoring logic to determine a winner from a series of moves.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Returned the correct result:
```
determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly:
1. Calculates individual round outcomes (win/lose/draw)
2. Computes the aggregate score
3. Determines the final winner based on score

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the implementation. All predicates function as intended:
- `move/1` (lines 3-5) correctly defines valid moves
- `beats/2` (lines 7-9) accurately represents game rules
- `outcome/3` (lines 14-16) properly determines round results
- `play/3` (lines 18-21) correctly processes move sequences
- `compute_score/2` (lines 23-26) accurately tallies results
- `determine_winner/3` (lines 27-31) properly interprets final outcome

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog analysis:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All rules follow correct logical relationships with proper:
   - Base cases (`play([],[],[])`, `compute_score([],0)`)
   - Recursive cases (properly chained through move sequences)
2. **Termination**: All recursive predicates have:
   - Decreasing list length in recursive calls
   - Proper base cases
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: 
   - No probabilistic facts are used (pure logical implementation)
   - All deterministic results correctly return probability 1.0
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning fully implemented
- Probabilistic reasoning not required (simple deterministic game)
- Neural network integration not required

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Non-move inputs would fail (expected behavior)
   - Uneven move lists would fail (expected behavior)
2. **Performance**: 
   - Linear recursion O(n) for n moves
   - No risk of stack overflow for reasonable game lengths
3. **Special Cases**:
   - Empty move lists correctly handled
   - All-draw games correctly scored
