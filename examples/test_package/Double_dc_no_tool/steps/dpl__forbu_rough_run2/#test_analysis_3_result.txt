# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its correctness and performance in sorting a list of integers. The implementation was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` to verify proper sorting functionality.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with an error message indicating an unknown clause for the `->/2` operator. The specific error occurred at line 6, character 22 in the code. No successful query results were obtained due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The failure occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically in the conditional statement at line 6:
```prolog
(Swapped == true ->
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
;
    append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)
)
```

The error indicates Problog doesn't recognize the standard Prolog `->/2` conditional operator syntax. This is a syntax compatibility issue between standard Prolog and Problog implementations.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm structure appears logically correct for a bubblesort implementation, with proper recursive cases and base cases.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion is properly bounded with base cases for empty lists and single-element lists.
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: Not applicable in this purely deterministic sorting implementation.
4. **DeepProbLog Features**: DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

The core issue is a syntax incompatibility - Problog requires different syntax for conditional statements compared to standard Prolog.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The implementation fails to meet basic functionality due to the syntax error. The classical reasoning aspect cannot be properly evaluated until the syntax is corrected.
2. **Edge Cases**: The implementation appears to handle edge cases (empty list, single-element list) correctly in its logic, though this cannot be verified without fixing the syntax error.
3. **Performance Considerations**: The recursive structure suggests potential performance issues with large lists due to the O(nÂ²) nature of bubblesort, but this is expected for this algorithm.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Problog doesn't recognize Prolog's `->/2` syntax | Complete failure to execute | Replace with Problog-compatible conditional syntax or use standard Prolog |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | N/A for this deterministic sort | Consider adding probabilistic components if required |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog features used | N/A | Add neural network integration if probabilistic sorting is needed |

**Recommendation**: The immediate fix would be to either:
1. Use standard Prolog instead of Problog for this deterministic algorithm, or
2. Rewrite the conditional using Problog's supported syntax for conditionals

The implementation shows proper algorithmic structure for bubblesort but cannot be properly evaluated until the syntax incompatibility is resolved. The word count for this report is approximately 420 words.
