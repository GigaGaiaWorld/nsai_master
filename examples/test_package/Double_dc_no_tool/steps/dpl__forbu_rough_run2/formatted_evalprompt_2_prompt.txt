</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its correctness and performance in sorting a list of integers. The code was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` to verify proper sorting functionality.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the error message:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:22.
```
The test failed to execute due to a syntax/implementation issue in the conditional statement within the bubblesort predicate.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-7), specifically at line 4 where a conditional `->/2` operator is used. The Problog engine cannot find the implementation for this conditional operator, indicating either:
1. The conditional syntax is incorrect for the Problog environment, or
2. The operator needs to be explicitly defined for Problog

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical Prolog, the implementation would work as it uses standard conditional syntax (`->/2`). However, in Problog:
1. The conditional operator may need different handling
2. The recursive logic appears correct for termination (base case exists)
3. No probabilistic facts or neural network integration is used in this implementation

Key findings:
- The algorithm's logical structure is sound for classical Prolog
- No probabilistic rules or DeepProbLog features are utilized ("DeepProbLog feature not used")
- The error stems from Problog's handling of conditionals rather than the algorithm itself

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet requirements because:
1. **Functional Requirements**: Fails in Problog environment due to conditional syntax
2. **Edge Cases**: Not properly tested for:
   - Empty lists (though base case exists)
   - Already sorted lists
   - Lists with duplicate elements
   - Non-integer inputs

The bubblesort logic itself appears correct for classical Prolog, but the Problog compatibility issue prevents proper execution.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Problog conditional operator not recognized | Complete failure | Rewrite using Problog-compatible conditionals or use pure Prolog |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | Limited functionality | Add probabilistic facts if needed |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog integration | Missing advanced features | Consider neural network integration if required |

```prolog
% Problem area in original code:
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Changed),
    (Changed == true ->  % Line causing the error
        bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
        append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).
```

Recommendations:
1. Either use pure Prolog environment for this implementation
2. Or rewrite the conditional using Problog-compatible constructs
3. Add proper test cases for edge scenarios
4. Consider adding probabilistic elements if probabilistic sorting is required

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
