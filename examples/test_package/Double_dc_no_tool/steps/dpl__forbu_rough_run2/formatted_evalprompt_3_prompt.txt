</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its correctness and performance in sorting a list of integers. The implementation was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` to verify proper sorting functionality.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with an error message indicating an unknown clause for the `->/2` operator. The specific error occurred at line 6, character 22 in the code. No successful query results were obtained due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The failure occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically in the conditional statement at line 6:
```prolog
(Swapped == true ->
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
;
    append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)
)
```

The error indicates Problog doesn't recognize the standard Prolog `->/2` conditional operator syntax. This is a syntax compatibility issue between standard Prolog and Problog implementations.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm structure appears logically correct for a bubblesort implementation, with proper recursive cases and base cases.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The recursion is properly bounded with base cases for empty lists and single-element lists.
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: Not applicable in this purely deterministic sorting implementation.
4. **DeepProbLog Features**: DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

The core issue is a syntax incompatibility - Problog requires different syntax for conditional statements compared to standard Prolog.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The implementation fails to meet basic functionality due to the syntax error. The classical reasoning aspect cannot be properly evaluated until the syntax is corrected.
2. **Edge Cases**: The implementation appears to handle edge cases (empty list, single-element list) correctly in its logic, though this cannot be verified without fixing the syntax error.
3. **Performance Considerations**: The recursive structure suggests potential performance issues with large lists due to the O(n²) nature of bubblesort, but this is expected for this algorithm.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Problog doesn't recognize Prolog's `->/2` syntax | Complete failure to execute | Replace with Problog-compatible conditional syntax or use standard Prolog |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | N/A for this deterministic sort | Consider adding probabilistic components if required |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog features used | N/A | Add neural network integration if probabilistic sorting is needed |

**Recommendation**: The immediate fix would be to either:
1. Use standard Prolog instead of Problog for this deterministic algorithm, or
2. Rewrite the conditional using Problog's supported syntax for conditionals

The implementation shows proper algorithmic structure for bubblesort but cannot be properly evaluated until the syntax incompatibility is resolved. The word count for this report is approximately 420 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
