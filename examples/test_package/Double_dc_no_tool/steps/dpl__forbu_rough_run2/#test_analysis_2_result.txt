# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its correctness and performance in sorting a list of integers. The code was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` to verify proper sorting functionality.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the error message:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:22.
```
The test failed to execute due to a syntax/implementation issue in the conditional statement within the bubblesort predicate.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-7), specifically at line 4 where a conditional `->/2` operator is used. The Problog engine cannot find the implementation for this conditional operator, indicating either:
1. The conditional syntax is incorrect for the Problog environment, or
2. The operator needs to be explicitly defined for Problog

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical Prolog, the implementation would work as it uses standard conditional syntax (`->/2`). However, in Problog:
1. The conditional operator may need different handling
2. The recursive logic appears correct for termination (base case exists)
3. No probabilistic facts or neural network integration is used in this implementation

Key findings:
- The algorithm's logical structure is sound for classical Prolog
- No probabilistic rules or DeepProbLog features are utilized ("DeepProbLog feature not used")
- The error stems from Problog's handling of conditionals rather than the algorithm itself

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet requirements because:
1. **Functional Requirements**: Fails in Problog environment due to conditional syntax
2. **Edge Cases**: Not properly tested for:
   - Empty lists (though base case exists)
   - Already sorted lists
   - Lists with duplicate elements
   - Non-integer inputs

The bubblesort logic itself appears correct for classical Prolog, but the Problog compatibility issue prevents proper execution.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Problog conditional operator not recognized | Complete failure | Rewrite using Problog-compatible conditionals or use pure Prolog |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | Limited functionality | Add probabilistic facts if needed |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog integration | Missing advanced features | Consider neural network integration if required |

```prolog
% Problem area in original code:
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble_pass(List, NewList, Changed),
    (Changed == true ->  % Line causing the error
        bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
        append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).
```

Recommendations:
1. Either use pure Prolog environment for this implementation
2. Or rewrite the conditional using Problog-compatible constructs
3. Add proper test cases for edge scenarios
4. Consider adding probabilistic elements if probabilistic sorting is required
