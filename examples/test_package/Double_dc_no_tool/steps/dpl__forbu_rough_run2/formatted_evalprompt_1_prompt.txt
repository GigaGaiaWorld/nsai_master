</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its correctness and performance in sorting a list of integers. The implementation was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` which should return the sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the error message:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:22.
```

The test failed to execute due to a syntax error in the conditional statement implementation.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-7), specifically at line 4 where the conditional operator `->` is used. The Prolog implementation contains incorrect syntax for the conditional statement.

Problematic code section:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped == true ->          % Line 4: Incorrect conditional syntax
        bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
        append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The conditional operator `->` is not properly implemented in this context. Prolog's if-then-else construct requires proper formatting and parentheses.
2. **Logical Structure**: While the overall algorithm structure is correct (bubble pass followed by recursive sort), the implementation fails due to syntax issues.
3. **ProbLog Context**: The error suggests the code was evaluated in a ProbLog environment, but no probabilistic features were actually used in the implementation.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The implementation fails to meet basic functional requirements due to syntax errors.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code doesn't handle:
   - Empty lists (though the base case is defined)
   - Non-integer inputs
   - Already sorted lists
3. **Probabilistic Features**: No probabilistic facts or rules are present ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
4. **Performance**: The recursive structure appears correct but cannot be verified due to syntax errors.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect conditional syntax in bubblesort/3 | Complete failure to execute | Rewrite using proper Prolog if-then-else structure |
| 2 | Missing probabilistic context | Not actually using ProbLog features | Either remove ProbLog dependency or add probabilistic elements |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors with bad inputs | Add type checking for list elements |

**Recommendation**: Rewrite the conditional statement using proper Prolog syntax:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (   Swapped == true
    ->  bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;   append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).
```

The implementation shows understanding of the bubblesort algorithm but fails due to basic syntax issues that prevent execution. Correcting the conditional statement should allow proper testing of the sorting functionality.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
