# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its correctness and performance in sorting a list of integers. The implementation was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` which should return the sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the error message:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:22.
```

The test failed to execute due to a syntax error in the conditional statement implementation.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate (lines 1-7), specifically at line 4 where the conditional operator `->` is used. The Prolog implementation contains incorrect syntax for the conditional statement.

Problematic code section:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (Swapped == true ->          % Line 4: Incorrect conditional syntax
        bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;
        append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The conditional operator `->` is not properly implemented in this context. Prolog's if-then-else construct requires proper formatting and parentheses.
2. **Logical Structure**: While the overall algorithm structure is correct (bubble pass followed by recursive sort), the implementation fails due to syntax issues.
3. **ProbLog Context**: The error suggests the code was evaluated in a ProbLog environment, but no probabilistic features were actually used in the implementation.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The implementation fails to meet basic functional requirements due to syntax errors.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code doesn't handle:
   - Empty lists (though the base case is defined)
   - Non-integer inputs
   - Already sorted lists
3. **Probabilistic Features**: No probabilistic facts or rules are present ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
4. **Performance**: The recursive structure appears correct but cannot be verified due to syntax errors.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect conditional syntax in bubblesort/3 | Complete failure to execute | Rewrite using proper Prolog if-then-else structure |
| 2 | Missing probabilistic context | Not actually using ProbLog features | Either remove ProbLog dependency or add probabilistic elements |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors with bad inputs | Add type checking for list elements |

**Recommendation**: Rewrite the conditional statement using proper Prolog syntax:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(List, NewList, Swapped),
    (   Swapped == true
    ->  bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ;   append(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
    ).
```

The implementation shows understanding of the bubblesort algorithm but fails due to basic syntax issues that prevent execution. Correcting the conditional statement should allow proper testing of the sorting functionality.
