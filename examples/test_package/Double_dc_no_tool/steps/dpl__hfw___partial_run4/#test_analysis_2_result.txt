# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to translate images into tokens, then parses these tokens to compute mathematical expressions. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the expression evaluation logic and its handling of basic arithmetic operations.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided evaluates the expression:  
`2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`  
which should yield `-13.666...` (or approximately `-13.6667`)

**Actual Test Result**:  
`expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], -10.333333333333332) = 1.0000`

**Verdict**: Test **failed**  
Expected: `-13.6667`  
Actual: `-10.3333`

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the parsing logic for subtraction operations (lines 23-25). The current implementation:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
    parse([-1, *|T], R2),
    almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
```
incorrectly transforms `a - b` into `a + (-1 * b)` instead of properly handling operator precedence. This causes the expression to be evaluated as `(2/(3+3)) + (-1*(2*7))` = `0.333 - 14` = `-10.333` instead of the correct `0.333 - 14` = `-13.666`.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Logic Issues**:
   - The subtraction rule doesn't maintain proper arithmetic precedence
   - The transformation should preserve the original structure rather than converting to addition

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this program
   - All detections are certain (probability 1.0)
   - DeepProbLog features are not utilized (no `nn/3` or tensor operations)

3. **Recursion Analysis**:
   - Recursive parsing terminates correctly on well-formed expressions
   - No stack overflow risks for reasonable expression lengths

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Basic arithmetic operations are implemented but with incorrect precedence handling
- Image-to-token translation works correctly
- Probabilistic reasoning requirements are not applicable here
- Neural network integration is not used

**Edge Cases Not Handled**:
- Division by zero (currently checks but doesn't handle gracefully)
- Unbalanced parentheses (not supported in current grammar)
- Non-list inputs would cause failures
- Very long expressions might risk stack overflow

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect subtraction precedence | Major calculation errors | Rewrite subtraction rule to maintain proper precedence |
| 2 | No graceful division by zero handling | Potential runtime errors | Add explicit failure case with error message |
| 3 | No parentheses support | Limited expression complexity | Implement proper parenthetical expression parsing |

**Recommendation**:  
Revise the subtraction rule to:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    almost_equal(N1 - R2, R).
```
This will properly maintain arithmetic precedence while keeping the recursive structure intact. The test case should then produce the correct result of `-13.6667`.
