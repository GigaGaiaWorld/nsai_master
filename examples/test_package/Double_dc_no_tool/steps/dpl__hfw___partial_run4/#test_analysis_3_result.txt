# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to translate images into tokens, then parses these tokens to compute mathematical expressions. The primary goal is to verify the correctness of the expression evaluation logic.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided evaluates the expression:  
`2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`  
Expected result: `-13.666...`  
Actual result: `-10.333...`  

**Test Outcome**:  
1. `query(expression([image_2,...],X))` failed (Actual: -10.333 vs Expected: -13.666)

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the parsing logic, specifically in the subtraction rule:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse([-1, *|T], R2),  % Line 32-33
 almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
```
This implementation incorrectly transforms subtraction into multiplication by -1 and addition, which doesn't maintain proper operator precedence.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Logic Issues**:
   - The subtraction rule violates arithmetic precedence by converting `A-B` into `A+(-1*B)`
   - No parentheses handling in the parser affects expression grouping

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts/rules used (pure deterministic logic)
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used"

3. **Recursion**:
   - Recursive termination works correctly via base case `parse([N], R)`
   - Recursive cases properly reduce the token list

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met**:
- Basic arithmetic operations work (+, *, /)
- Image-to-token translation functions correctly
- Recursive parsing structure is sound

**Deficiencies**:
- Missing operator precedence handling
- No parentheses support
- Incorrect subtraction implementation

**Edge Cases Not Handled**:
- Division by zero (though checked, not properly propagated)
- Non-list inputs to `detect_all/2`
- Empty input lists
- Invalid operator sequences

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect subtraction implementation | Wrong calculation results | Implement proper subtraction handling |
| 2 | Missing operator precedence | Incorrect evaluation order | Add precedence rules or use AST |
| 3 | No parentheses support | Can't handle nested expressions | Add parenthesis parsing |
| 4 | No error handling | Crashes on invalid input | Add input validation |

**Word Count**: 423

The core issue lies in the arithmetic expression parsing logic, which needs to properly handle operator precedence and subtraction operations. The probabilistic aspects of ProbLog are not utilized in this implementation.
