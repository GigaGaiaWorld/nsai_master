# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Number Detection and Expression Evaluation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to:
1. Detect numbers (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /) from image representations
2. Parse and evaluate mathematical expressions composed of these elements
3. Handle both classical and probabilistic reasoning scenarios

## Test Results Summary
The system executed one main test query:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:**
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],-10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
- Calculation: 2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7 = (2/6) - 14 â‰ˆ 0.333 - 14 = -13.666 (expected)
- Actual output: -10.333 (incorrect)
- **Test failed** - Result doesn't match expected calculation

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the expression evaluation chain, specifically in the subtraction handling:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse([-1, *|T], R2),  % Line with error
 almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
```
This incorrectly transforms `a - b` into `a + (-1 * b)` but then adds instead of subtracting.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error**: The subtraction rule adds the negated term instead of subtracting it
2. **Precedence Handling**: The parser correctly handles operator precedence but fails in arithmetic execution
3. **Probabilistic Aspect**: All detections have probability 1.0, so the error is purely in classical logic
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration detected ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## Overall Analysis
**Strengths:**
- Complete number and operator detection coverage
- Correct operator precedence handling
- Proper recursive termination in parsing

**Weaknesses:**
- Incorrect arithmetic implementation for subtraction
- No error handling for division by zero in the main expression flow
- No probabilistic uncertainty modeling in detections

**Edge Cases Missed:**
- Division by zero only checked in `/` rule but not in full expression evaluation
- No input validation for non-list inputs
- No handling for malformed expressions (e.g., ending with operator)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect subtraction implementation | Wrong calculation results | Change `N1 + R2` to `N1 - R2` |
| 2 | No probability modeling | Loses probabilistic aspect | Add uncertainty to detect_* predicates |
| 3 | Limited error handling | May crash on invalid inputs | Add input validation clauses |

**Corrected Subtraction Rule:**
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse([-1, *|T], R2),
 almost_equal(N1 - R2, R).  % Fixed from + to -
```

The system shows good structure but requires correction in fundamental arithmetic operations and could benefit from proper probabilistic modeling of detections.
