# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that models coin tossing with a biased coin (probability 0.8 for heads). The program recursively counts the number of heads (S) when tossing CNT independent coins, with a specific test case of tossing 4 coins (CNT=4).

## Test Results Summary
The test results show probability distributions for getting 0-4 heads when tossing 4 biased coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```
All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly follow binomial distribution probabilities for 4 trials with p=0.8:
- P(4 heads) = 0.8⁴ = 0.4096
- P(3 heads) = 4 × 0.8³ × 0.2 = 0.4096
- P(2 heads) = 6 × 0.8² × 0.2² = 0.1536
- P(1 head) = 4 × 0.8 × 0.2³ = 0.0256
- P(0 heads) = 0.2⁴ = 0.0016

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the test results. The implementation correctly:
1. Defines the biased coin with `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` and `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8)`
2. Implements recursive counting in `coins_r/3` (lines 4-15)
3. Properly handles base case and two recursive cases (head or tail outcomes)

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. The probability of ¬coin (tails) is correctly computed as 1-0.8 = 0.2
2. The recursive cases properly accumulate probabilities:
   - When `coin(CNT)` succeeds (probability 0.8), it increments the head count
   - When `\+ coin(CNT)` succeeds (probability 0.2), it continues without incrementing
3. The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` correctly terminates recursion
4. DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
- Classical reasoning (correct recursive counting)
- Probabilistic reasoning (proper probability accumulation)
Edge cases handled correctly:
- Base case (CNT=0) properly terminates recursion
- Probability calculations maintain proper distributions
- No list inputs or undefined predicates to consider

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

The implementation is correct and complete for the specified requirements. The probabilistic calculations follow proper probability theory rules, and the recursive logic properly accumulates results. No errors or improvements were identified in this evaluation.
