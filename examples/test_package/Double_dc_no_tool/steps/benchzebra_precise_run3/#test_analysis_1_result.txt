# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given clues. The implementation uses logical constraints to solve the puzzle by defining relationships between house attributes.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Primary Failure**:
   - Error occurs at line 4, column 1
   - Missing predicate definition for `member/2`
   - While the code includes a `my_member/2` definition, it incorrectly calls `member/2`

2. **Secondary Issue**:
   - The `houses/1` predicate is defined but not properly integrated with the constraints
   - The `query(zebra(Houses))` is at the end but the error prevents it from being reached

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The code mixes standard Prolog predicates (`member/2`) with custom implementations (`my_member/2`)
   - Recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) appear correct but aren't tested due to earlier failure
   - Logical constraints are properly structured but never executed

2. **ProbLog Specifics**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are utilized
   - Pure logical constraint satisfaction problem

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but not executable
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized
   - Neural network integration: Not present ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined `member/2` predicate prevents any execution
   - House structure constraints appear correct but untested
   - Recursive predicates might work but cannot be verified

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure | Replace with `my_member/2` or import lists module |
| 2 | Unused `houses/1` definition | Potential confusion | Integrate with main zebra predicate |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical Prolog | Consider adding probabilistic constraints if needed |

## Corrective Recommendations
1. Replace all instances of `member/2` with `my_member/2` or add:
   ```prolog
   :- use_module(library(lists)).
   ```
2. Ensure the `houses/1` predicate is properly utilized in the main zebra predicate
3. Consider adding proper query formatting for ProbLog execution

The corrected version should begin with:
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(spanish, _, _, _, dog), Houses),
    % ... rest of constraints ...
```
