# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code attempts to solve the puzzle by defining constraints on house attributes (nationality, color, pet, drink, and cigarette) across five adjacent houses.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a fundamental error:
```
Error: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1
```
The test fails completely as the program cannot even start execution due to this missing predicate definition.

## 3. Failure Localization
- **Failed Component**: Missing `member/2` predicate
- **Location**: The error occurs at the very first constraint line (line 4) where `member/2` is called
- **Impact**: All subsequent constraints cannot be evaluated
- **Root Cause**: While the code defines `my_member/2`, it incorrectly uses `member/2` in the constraints

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The error stems from a naming inconsistency:
1. The code defines a custom membership predicate `my_member/2`
2. However, all constraints use the standard Prolog `member/2` predicate
3. ProbLog doesn't automatically import Prolog's built-in predicates

Key observations:
- Classical logic structure appears correct (all constraints properly represent puzzle rules)
- Recursive definitions for `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` are properly implemented
- No probabilistic elements or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (logic appears correct but can't execute)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules)
- Neural integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

**Edge Cases:**
- Missing predicate handling (critical failure)
- List structure validation (not checked but Houses is properly initialized)
- Recursive performance (not an issue due to small problem size)

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure | Replace with `my_member/2` or import lists module |
| 2 | No error handling for malformed input | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements used | Limited to classical reasoning | Consider adding probabilistic constraints |

**Corrected Code Block:**
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(spanish, _, dog, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, green, _, coffee, _), Houses),
    % ... (all other constraints using my_member instead of member)
```

The solution requires either:
1. Replacing all `member/2` calls with `my_member/2`, or
2. Adding `:- use_module(library(lists)).` to import the standard member predicate
