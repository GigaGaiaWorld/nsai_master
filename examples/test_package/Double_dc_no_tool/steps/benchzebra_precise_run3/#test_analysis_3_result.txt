# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given clues. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and identify any errors in the ProbLog code.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs because:
1. The code uses `member/2` predicate (line 4) but this predicate is not defined in the ProbLog environment
2. While there is a custom `my_member/2` defined later in the code, it's not being used in the main zebra/1 predicate

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Analysis**:
   - The logical structure of the puzzle constraints appears correct
   - The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are properly defined and should terminate
   - The main issue is the missing `member/2` implementation

2. **Probabilistic Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The code is purely deterministic logical programming
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used" - no neural network integration present

3. **Implementation Issues**:
   - The code mixes standard Prolog predicates (`member/2`) with ProbLog syntax without proper adaptation
   - The custom `my_member/2` is defined but not utilized where needed

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (logic is correct but implementation fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The house list structure is properly initialized
   - Recursion depth is limited (5 houses) so performance isn't an issue
   - Input validation isn't needed as the problem is self-contained

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Code cannot execute | Replace with `my_member/2` or define `member/2` |
| 2 | Unused `my_member/2` definition | Redundant code | Either use it or remove it |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical reasoning | Consider adding probabilistic constraints if needed |

## Corrective Action
The main fix required is to replace all instances of `member/2` with `my_member/2` in the zebra/1 predicate. The corrected code block should begin:
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(spanish, _, dog, _, _), Houses),
    ...
```

This change would allow the puzzle to execute properly while maintaining all the logical constraints. The rest of the implementation appears correct and properly structured for solving the zebra puzzle.
