</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given clues. The implementation uses logical constraints to solve the puzzle by defining relationships between house attributes.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

## Failure Localization
1. **Primary Failure**:
   - Error occurs at line 4, column 1
   - Missing predicate definition for `member/2`
   - While the code includes a `my_member/2` definition, it incorrectly calls `member/2`

2. **Secondary Issue**:
   - The `houses/1` predicate is defined but not properly integrated with the constraints
   - The `query(zebra(Houses))` is at the end but the error prevents it from being reached

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The code mixes standard Prolog predicates (`member/2`) with custom implementations (`my_member/2`)
   - Recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) appear correct but aren't tested due to earlier failure
   - Logical constraints are properly structured but never executed

2. **ProbLog Specifics**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are utilized
   - Pure logical constraint satisfaction problem

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but not executable
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized
   - Neural network integration: Not present ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined `member/2` predicate prevents any execution
   - House structure constraints appear correct but untested
   - Recursive predicates might work but cannot be verified

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure | Replace with `my_member/2` or import lists module |
| 2 | Unused `houses/1` definition | Potential confusion | Integrate with main zebra predicate |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Limited to classical Prolog | Consider adding probabilistic constraints if needed |

## Corrective Recommendations
1. Replace all instances of `member/2` with `my_member/2` or add:
   ```prolog
   :- use_module(library(lists)).
   ```
2. Ensure the `houses/1` predicate is properly utilized in the main zebra predicate
3. Consider adding proper query formatting for ProbLog execution

The corrected version should begin with:
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(spanish, _, _, _, dog), Houses),
    % ... rest of constraints ...
```

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
