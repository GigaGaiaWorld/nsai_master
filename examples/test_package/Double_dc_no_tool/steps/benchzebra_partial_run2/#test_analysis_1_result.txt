# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly encoded.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows one successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as evidenced by the complete match between the generated solution and puzzle requirements.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All constraints were properly encoded and verified:
1. House color-nationality constraints (red-English, blue-Norwegian neighbor)
2. Pet ownership constraints (Spanish-dog, snail-Winstons)
3. Beverage preferences (green-coffee, milk in middle house)
4. Smoking preferences (yellow-Kools, Japanese-Parliaments)
5. Positional relationships (green right of ivory, Norwegian in first house)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical Problog reasoning:
1. All recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) properly terminate
2. Constraints are logically sound with no contradictions
3. The puzzle's deterministic nature is reflected in the 1.0000 probability result

Probabilistic aspects:
- No probabilistic facts or rules were used (pure logical puzzle)
- No DeepProbLog features (`nn/3`, `tensor`) were utilized
- All constraints are hard constraints with probability 1.0

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Fully satisfies all puzzle constraints
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not utilized (not needed for this puzzle)
3. **Neural network integration**: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

Edge case considerations:
1. The fixed 5-house structure prevents invalid inputs
2. Recursion depth is limited to 5 (number of houses)
3. All constraints are properly bounded by the house structure

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation is correct |

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly encoded. The solution matches the expected arrangement of houses with perfect probability (1.0000), demonstrating correct logical reasoning in ProbLog. No improvements are needed for this specific puzzle implementation.
