# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code should correctly model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the player decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and requirement compliance.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:121
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error. The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate definition.

## 3. Failure Localization
The error originates from line 6 (character 121) in the `open_door/1` definition. The problematic code block:
```prolog
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(S), 
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= S), Doors), 
    length(Doors, L), 
    (L =:= 2 -> member(D, Doors), 0.5::open_door(D) ; member(D, Doors)).
```

Key issues:
1. The probabilistic annotation `0.5::open_door(D)` is incorrectly placed inside the clause body
2. The syntax for probabilistic choice between alternatives is incorrect

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The implementation fails because:
1. **Probabilistic Fact Placement**: Probabilistic facts must be defined at the top level, not within rule bodies
2. **Logical Structure**: The requirements call for two distinct cases (2 available doors vs 1 available door), which should be implemented as separate clauses
3. **Probabilistic Rules**: The current implementation mixes deterministic and probabilistic reasoning incorrectly

For probabilistic correctness:
- The negation `\+ prize(X)` should properly account for the 1/3 probability distribution
- The uniform choice between two doors should be explicitly modeled with proper probabilistic facts

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- The code attempts but fails to meet both requirements for Monty's door-opening behavior
- Probabilistic reasoning is incorrectly implemented
- Classical reasoning about door selection is correctly implemented

**Edge Cases:**
- No handling for invalid door numbers
- No validation for multiple door selections
- Recursive member/2 predicate could potentially stack overflow with very large lists

**DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect probabilistic fact placement | Compilation failure | Move probabilistic choices to top level |
| 2 | Improper handling of two-door case | Incorrect probability distribution | Implement as separate clause with explicit 0.5 probabilities |
| 3 | Single-door case not properly isolated | Potential logical errors | Implement as deterministic clause |
| 4 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add guards for door numbers and selection |

**Recommended Fix:**
```prolog
% For case with two available doors
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(S),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= S), [D1,D2]),
    (0.5::open_door(D1) ; 0.5::open_door(D2)).

% For case with one available door
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(S),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= S), [D]).
```

The corrected implementation should properly model both scenarios while maintaining correct probabilistic reasoning.
