# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code should correctly model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical syntax error. The error message indicates:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:139
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate definition (lines 6-139). The implementation attempts to use an if-then-else construct (`->/2`) but contains malformed syntax that ProbLog cannot parse.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The `open_door/1` predicate incorrectly implements the conditional logic. ProbLog expects proper if-then-else structure with clear alternatives.
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The intended 50-50 distribution when two doors are available isn't properly implemented due to the syntax error.
3. **Logical Flow**: The recursive `member/2` predicate is correctly defined but never properly utilized due to the main predicate failure.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (member/2 works)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Failed (main predicate doesn't execute)
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined cases for door selection handling
   - No protection against invalid door numbers
   - No validation for list inputs in member/2

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed if-then-else syntax in open_door/1 | Complete failure | Rewrite using proper ProbLog conditional syntax |
| 2 | Missing base case validation | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for door numbers |
| 3 | Unclear probability distribution | Incorrect results | Explicitly define probabilistic choices |

## Corrected Implementation Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors),
    (Doors = [A,B] -> 
        0.5::open_door(A), 0.5::open_door(B)
    ; 
        Doors = [D]
    ).
```

The evaluation reveals a critical syntax error preventing execution. The core logic appears conceptually correct but requires proper ProbLog syntax implementation. Addressing the if-then-else structure should resolve the immediate issue, with additional validation recommended for robustness.
