# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, where a player selects a door and the host opens another door revealing no prize. The code should correctly model the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching doors.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical error during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:151.
```

No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error. The system cannot find the required clauses for the `->/2` operator in the `open_door/1` predicate.

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-151 in the error message, though exact line numbers aren't provided in the source). The issue stems from incorrect syntax in the conditional statement (`->`) within the `open_door/1` definition.

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The conditional statement in `open_door/1` is malformed. ProbLog requires proper parentheses and structure for conditionals.

2. **Probabilistic Fact Placement**: The probabilistic choice (0.5::open_door(D)) is incorrectly placed inside the conditional.

3. **Logical Flow**: The current implementation doesn't properly handle the two required cases for Monty's door opening behavior.

## 5. Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet functional requirements due to the syntax error. Key observations:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Not properly implemented due to compilation failure.
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The probability distribution for door selection isn't correctly expressed.
3. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (not required for this problem).

Edge cases not properly handled:
- No validation for door selection
- No handling for cases where all doors might have prizes (though impossible per problem definition)

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed conditional in open_door/1 | Code cannot execute | Rewrite conditional with proper ProbLog syntax |
| 2 | Incorrect probability placement | Wrong probability distribution | Move probabilistic fact outside conditional |
| 3 | Missing base cases | Potential infinite recursion | Ensure all paths have proper termination |

## Suggested Correction
```prolog
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), Doors),
    length(Doors, Len),
    (
        Len = 2 -> 
        member(D, Doors),
        0.5::open_door(D)
        ;
        Len = 1 -> 
        member(D, Doors)
    ).
```

The main issues preventing successful execution are fundamental syntax errors that need to be addressed before the probabilistic reasoning can be properly evaluated. The corrected version should use proper ProbLog conditional syntax and properly structure the probabilistic choices.
