# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Key Carrying Scenario

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's interaction with a key in a dynamic environment. The code combines probabilistic facts with logical rules to simulate actions like picking up keys, moving between locations, and handling slippery objects. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in this scenario.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query outcomes:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities are consistent with the defined rules and probabilistic facts:
1. The robot's movement probabilities (90% success) correctly propagate through time steps
2. The key carrying probability combines pickup success (70%) with retention probabilities
3. The key location properly reflects both carried and stationary states

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All expansion predicates and probabilistic rules behave as expected. The code correctly handles:
- Classical reasoning about robot and key positions
- Probabilistic facts about action outcomes
- Recursive time steps through s(T) notation

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic calculations comply with standard rules:
1. Negation: `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is correctly implemented in all negated conditions
2. Conjunction: Joint probabilities are properly multiplied (e.g., pickup success × retention)
3. Disjunction: Alternative outcomes are correctly summed (e.g., different drop scenarios)

Key probability calculations:
- Pickup success: 0.7 base probability
- Retention probability: 0.8 (non-slippery) × 0.5 (initial state) + slippery path probabilities
- Movement success: 0.9 base probability

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models state transitions and position tracking
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately combines probabilities through time steps
3. **Edge cases**: Handles initial conditions and recursive time steps properly

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. Multiple keys scenario (current code assumes single key)
2. Simultaneous actions (current model assumes sequential actions)
3. Deep recursion performance (not tested beyond s(s(s(0))))
