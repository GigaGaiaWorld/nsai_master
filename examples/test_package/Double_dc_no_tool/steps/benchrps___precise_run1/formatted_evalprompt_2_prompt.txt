</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner from sequences of player moves. The code should correctly identify round outcomes and calculate the final winner based on accumulated scores.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 44:16
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate implementation. The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (missing period at end)
2. Malformed conditional statement syntax (using `->` without proper Prolog syntax)
3. Line 44 contains the malformed conditional logic

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog:
1. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented
2. The base cases for empty lists are properly defined
3. The win/lose/draw logic in `result/3` is correct

The main issue is purely syntactic:
- The conditional statement in `determine_winner` violates Prolog syntax rules
- The predicate was not properly terminated before the test query

Probabilistic aspects:
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements:
1. Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but final predicate fails)
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
3. Neural network integration: Not used

Edge cases:
1. Non-list inputs would cause type errors
2. Uneven length move lists would fail
3. Invalid moves would not be handled

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed conditional syntax | Predicate fails to execute | Use proper Prolog if-then-else syntax |
| 2 | Missing predicate terminator | Causes parsing error | Add period at end of predicate |
| 3 | No input validation | May crash on invalid moves | Add move validation checks |

## Corrected Code
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'
    ; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'
    ; Winner = 'Draw').
```

The corrected version uses proper Prolog syntax for conditionals and includes all necessary terminators. With these fixes, the implementation should correctly determine game winners from move sequences.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
