</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning aspects. The code defines game rules, calculates round results, computes scores, and determines the overall winner between two players.

## Test Results Summary
The test encountered an error when executing the query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

Error message:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. A syntax error in the conditional statement (`->/2` operator)
2. Missing proper predicate termination (period after the rule)
3. The predicate appears to be defined twice (lines 41 and the following block)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The game rules and result calculations are correctly defined
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases
3. **Syntax Issues**: The main error comes from improper use of the conditional operator and duplicate predicate definition

Probabilistic aspects are not utilized in this implementation (no probabilistic facts or rules), so probabilistic rules don't apply here.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases**:
1. Non-list inputs aren't handled
2. Lists of unequal length would cause issues
3. Invalid moves aren't filtered
4. Deep recursion could be problematic for long game sequences

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in conditional | Predicate fails to execute | Fix operator usage and ensure proper predicate termination |
| 2 | Duplicate predicate definition | Potential ambiguity | Remove duplicate definition |
| 3 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking for moves and lists |
| 4 | Unequal list lengths not handled | May produce incorrect results | Add length check or pad shorter list |

**Corrected Code Block**:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The evaluation reveals that while the core game logic is sound, the winner determination predicate contains critical syntax errors that prevent successful execution. Addressing these issues would make the implementation fully functional for classical reasoning scenarios.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
