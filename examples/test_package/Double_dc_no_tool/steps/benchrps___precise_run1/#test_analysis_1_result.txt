# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning aspects. The code defines game rules, calculates round results, computes scores, and determines the overall winner between two players.

## Test Results Summary
The test encountered an error when executing the query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

Error message:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. A syntax error in the conditional statement (`->/2` operator)
2. Missing proper predicate termination (period after the rule)
3. The predicate appears to be defined twice (lines 41 and the following block)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The game rules and result calculations are correctly defined
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases
3. **Syntax Issues**: The main error comes from improper use of the conditional operator and duplicate predicate definition

Probabilistic aspects are not utilized in this implementation (no probabilistic facts or rules), so probabilistic rules don't apply here.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases**:
1. Non-list inputs aren't handled
2. Lists of unequal length would cause issues
3. Invalid moves aren't filtered
4. Deep recursion could be problematic for long game sequences

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in conditional | Predicate fails to execute | Fix operator usage and ensure proper predicate termination |
| 2 | Duplicate predicate definition | Potential ambiguity | Remove duplicate definition |
| 3 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking for moves and lists |
| 4 | Unequal list lengths not handled | May produce incorrect results | Add length check or pad shorter list |

**Corrected Code Block**:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The evaluation reveals that while the core game logic is sound, the winner determination predicate contains critical syntax errors that prevent successful execution. Addressing these issues would make the implementation fully functional for classical reasoning scenarios.
