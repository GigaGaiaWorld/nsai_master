# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code is designed to:
1. Define the basic game rules (moves and winning conditions)
2. Compare moves between two players
3. Calculate game results and determine the winner
4. Handle sequences of moves in a tournament-style format

## 2. Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:

```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```

The test query was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate implementation. The specific issues are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate definition is incomplete/malformed (line 41)
2. **Missing Implementation**: The actual implementation shown in the `<Langda>` block isn't properly integrated into the main code
3. **Incorrect Operator**: The if-then-else construct (`->/2`) isn't properly formatted

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues are classical Prolog syntax problems:

1. The `determine_winner/3` predicate is started but not properly completed
2. The correct implementation (shown in the `<Langda>` block) needs to replace the incomplete stub
3. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correct, but never reached due to the syntax error

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Basic game rules are correctly implemented
- Move comparison logic works correctly
- Score computation is properly recursive
- **Missing**: The winner determination isn't properly implemented

**Edge Cases:**
- Non-list inputs aren't handled
- Unequal length move lists would cause issues
- Deep recursion could be problematic for very long games

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Code fails to run | Replace with complete implementation from `<Langda>` block |
| 2 | Malformed if-then-else | Syntax error | Ensure proper Prolog conditional syntax |
| 3 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for move lists |

## Recommended Fix
Replace the incomplete `determine_winner/3` with:

```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

**Note**: DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation. The issues are purely related to classical Prolog syntax and program structure.
