# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner from sequences of player moves. The code should correctly identify round outcomes and calculate the final winner based on accumulated scores.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 44:16
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate implementation. The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (missing period at end)
2. Malformed conditional statement syntax (using `->` without proper Prolog syntax)
3. Line 44 contains the malformed conditional logic

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog:
1. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented
2. The base cases for empty lists are properly defined
3. The win/lose/draw logic in `result/3` is correct

The main issue is purely syntactic:
- The conditional statement in `determine_winner` violates Prolog syntax rules
- The predicate was not properly terminated before the test query

Probabilistic aspects:
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements:
1. Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but final predicate fails)
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
3. Neural network integration: Not used

Edge cases:
1. Non-list inputs would cause type errors
2. Uneven length move lists would fail
3. Invalid moves would not be handled

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed conditional syntax | Predicate fails to execute | Use proper Prolog if-then-else syntax |
| 2 | Missing predicate terminator | Causes parsing error | Add period at end of predicate |
| 3 | No input validation | May crash on invalid moves | Add move validation checks |

## Corrected Code
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'
    ; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'
    ; Winner = 'Draw').
```

The corrected version uses proper Prolog syntax for conditionals and includes all necessary terminators. With these fixes, the implementation should correctly determine game winners from move sequences.
