# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic for this safety-critical system.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability values as shown below:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
- goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
- goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
- goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
- goal_reached(5) = 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities show expected decreasing trends for goal achievement and increasing then stabilizing trends for overruns.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Goal checking via `goal_reached/1`
- Actuator selection via `use_actuator/2`
- Wind effect calculations via `wind_effect/2`
- Position updates via `attempted_flap_position/2`

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection follows the 50/50 distribution (lines 5-6)
2. Wind strength probabilities correctly propagate (lines 8-10)
3. Position calculations properly combine deterministic and probabilistic components (lines 27-38)
4. The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` correctly implements P(¬A)=1−P(A)

**DeepProbLog Feature:** DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Correct position updates and goal checking
- Probabilistic reasoning: Proper handling of actuator/wind uncertainties
- Edge cases: Legal position checks prevent invalid states

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add bounds checking for position arithmetic overflow
2. Consider adding visualization predicates for trajectory analysis
3. Could extend with actuator failure probabilities

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | N/A |

**Code Quality Observation:** The implementation shows good probabilistic modeling practices. The separation of wind strength modeling from effect calculation (lines 8-10 vs 27-38) demonstrates proper concern for maintainability.

**Word Count:** 423 words (including tables and code blocks)

% Well-implemented core logic example:
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time-1,
    flap_position(Prev,Old),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time,A),
    actuator_strength(A,AS),
    goal(GP),
    Direction is sign(GP - Old),
    AE is Direction * AS,
