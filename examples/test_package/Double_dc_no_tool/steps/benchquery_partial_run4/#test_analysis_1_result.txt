# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Prolog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population density from given population and area data, then finds country pairs where one density is slightly higher than another (within a 5% margin).

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful queries:
```
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All queries returned expected results with probability 1.0, indicating perfect matches within the specified density ratio (20:21).

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The following components were verified:
- `density/2` predicate correctly computes density (lines 10-13)
- `query_pop/1` correctly implements the comparison logic (lines 5-9)
- All population and area facts are properly defined

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: 
   - Density calculation `D is (P*100)//A` properly handles integer arithmetic
   - Comparison logic `D1 > D2, T1 is 20*D1, T2 is 21*D2, T1 < T2` correctly implements the 5% margin requirement

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - The program uses classical Prolog without probabilistic features
   - No DeepProbLog features (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used
   - All results show probability 1.0, indicating deterministic facts

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (classical Prolog only)
- Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Integer division in density calculation prevents floating-point inaccuracies
2. The 5% margin (20:21 ratio) is strictly enforced
3. All country pairs are properly ordered (D1 > D2)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for non-existent countries
2. Consider floating-point division for more precise density values
3. Extend with probabilistic population estimates

## 6. Error Summary

The evaluation confirms the program correctly implements its specified functionality for finding countries with similar population densities using classical Prolog reasoning. All test cases pass as expected, demonstrating robust implementation of the core logic.
