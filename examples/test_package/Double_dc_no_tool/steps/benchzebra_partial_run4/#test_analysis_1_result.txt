# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle involves determining who owns the zebra based on a set of given constraints about house colors, nationalities, pets, drinks, and cigarettes. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly encoded.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows one successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as evidenced by the complete match with expected logical requirements.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All constraints were properly encoded and the solution matches all requirements:
1. Red house is English (769EF692)
2. Spanish has dog (430FAC43)
3. Green house drinks coffee (F5F641BC)
4. Snail owner smokes Winstons (3127CC36)
5. Middle house drinks milk (4AC08146)
6. Norwegian next to blue house (D316E87D)
7. Someone has zebra (CFE3727A)
8. Someone drinks water (87D90A3D)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly handles:
- Classical Problog scenarios through proper constraint satisfaction
- Recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) all terminate properly
- All constraints are implemented as hard rules (probability 1.0)
- No probabilistic facts or negations were needed in this puzzle
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration required)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: All constraints are correctly implemented through logical predicates
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not heavily utilized (all facts are certain)
3. **Neural network integration**: Not used

Edge cases considered:
- House ordering is properly enforced through `right_of` and `next_to`
- Middle house constraint explicitly checks position 3
- All member checks properly verify existence of attributes
- Recursion depth is limited to 5 houses (no performance issues)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |

The implementation is logically sound and correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly enforced. The solution matches exactly one possible configuration that satisfies all given requirements.
