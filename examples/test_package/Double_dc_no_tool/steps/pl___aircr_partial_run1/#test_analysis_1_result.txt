# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system models actuator selection, wind effects, and flap position control with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probability distributions:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
All tests passed (no failures) as the results demonstrate consistent probability distributions that align with the system's design expectations.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
- `flap_position/2` (B79F5C58) correctly implements legal position movement
- `overrun_exception/1` (E185A34B) properly detects illegal positions
- `goal_reached/1` (779B4ADF) accurately checks goal achievement
- All expansion predicates are correctly implemented in both classical and probabilistic contexts

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection probabilities (50/50 split) are correctly implemented
2. Wind effect distributions properly condition on wind strength
3. Probability rules are correctly applied:
   - `P(Â¬legal_position) = 1-P(legal_position)` in overrun detection
   - Joint probabilities correctly computed for actuator+wind combinations
4. Recursive termination is ensured by the `at(5)` time limit
5. DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly handles flap position logic and goal checking
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Properly combines probabilities from multiple sources (actuators, wind)
3. **Edge cases**:
   - Initial position (6) and goal (4) are properly defined
   - Time bounds are correctly enforced
   - Illegal positions are properly detected
4. **Potential improvements**:
   - Could add validation for actuator strength values
   - Might include bounds checking for wind effect calculations

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning with proper handling of all specified edge cases. The probability distributions in the test results show expected behavior where goal achievement probabilities decrease over time while overrun exceptions show a small but increasing probability.
