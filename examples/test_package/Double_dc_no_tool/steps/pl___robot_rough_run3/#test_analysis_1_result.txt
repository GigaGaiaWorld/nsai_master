# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's key pickup and movement scenario. The code implements probabilistic rules for carrying objects, movement success/failure, and slippery conditions. The purpose is to verify correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned the following probability results:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4813
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6300
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3630
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0070
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results show consistent probabilities that properly account for all possible execution paths and their combined probabilities.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
- `carrying/2` rules (lines 1-10) properly model key pickup and retention
- `drops/2` (lines 12-16) correctly handles slippery conditions
- `at/3` predicates (lines 28-40) accurately model robot movement and key location
- All probabilistic facts (e.g., lines 18, 22, 26) follow proper probability distributions

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. **Negation Handling**: `\+ drops(key,T)` properly computes as `1 - P(drops(key,T))`
2. **Probability Combinations**: Joint probabilities correctly multiply (e.g., pickup success * retention probability)
3. **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates (e.g., `slippery/2`) have proper base cases
4. **Disjoint Cases**: Mutually exclusive cases (success/failure) properly sum probabilities

**DeepProbLog Feature Not Used** - No neural network integration (`nn/3` or `tensor` calls) appears in the code.

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets its requirements for:
- **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly models state transitions over time steps
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Accurately computes combined probabilities of complex scenarios

Edge cases properly handled:
- Key drop probabilities account for both slippery and fumble cases
- Movement failure preserves previous location
- Initial slippery state properly initialized
