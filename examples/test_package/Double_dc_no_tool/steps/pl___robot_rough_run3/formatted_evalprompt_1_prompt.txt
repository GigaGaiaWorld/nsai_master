<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's key pickup and movement scenario. The code implements probabilistic rules for carrying objects, movement success/failure, and slippery conditions. The purpose is to verify correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned the following probability results:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4813
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.6300
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3630
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0070
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results show consistent probabilities that properly account for all possible execution paths and their combined probabilities.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates are correctly defined:
- `carrying/2` rules (lines 1-10) properly model key pickup and retention
- `drops/2` (lines 12-16) correctly handles slippery conditions
- `at/3` predicates (lines 28-40) accurately model robot movement and key location
- All probabilistic facts (e.g., lines 18, 22, 26) follow proper probability distributions

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. **Negation Handling**: `\+ drops(key,T)` properly computes as `1 - P(drops(key,T))`
2. **Probability Combinations**: Joint probabilities correctly multiply (e.g., pickup success * retention probability)
3. **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates (e.g., `slippery/2`) have proper base cases
4. **Disjoint Cases**: Mutually exclusive cases (success/failure) properly sum probabilities

**DeepProbLog Feature Not Used** - No neural network integration (`nn/3` or `tensor` calls) appears in the code.

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets its requirements for:
- **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly models state transitions over time steps
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Accurately computes combined probabilities of complex scenarios

Edge cases properly handled:
- Key drop probabilities account for both slippery and fumble cases
- Movement failure preserves previous location
- Initial slippery state properly initialized

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The code demonstrates robust probabilistic modeling with proper handling of all specified scenarios. No errors or improvements were identified in the current implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
