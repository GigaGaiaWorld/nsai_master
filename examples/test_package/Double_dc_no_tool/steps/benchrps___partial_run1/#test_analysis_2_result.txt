# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates results between players, computes scores, and determines winners. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:**  
`determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verification:**  
- Expected: Player2 should win (rock vs paper → lose, rock vs paper → lose, rock vs scissor → win → total score -1)
- Actual: Matches expectation with probability 1.0000  
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Basic move definitions (rock, paper, scissor)
- Win/lose/draw logic (beats/2 and result/3 predicates)
- Score computation and winner determination
- List processing through recursion

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - All game rules are properly defined (lines 1-15)
   - The result/3 predicate covers all cases (draw, win, lose) (lines 18-26)
   - Recursive predicates (play/3 and compute_score/2) have proper base cases

2. **Termination:**
   - All recursive predicates terminate when input lists are empty
   - No infinite recursion paths exist

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- The implementation uses classical Prolog without probabilistic facts
- No probabilistic rules or neural network integration (DeepProbLog feature not used)
- All results have certainty (1.0000 probability)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized in this implementation
- Neural network integration: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used)

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty move lists (handled by play([],[],[]))
2. All possible move combinations (rock/paper/scissor)
3. Equal length move lists (assumed by the implementation)
4. Score calculation handles all result types (win/lose/draw)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for move lists
2. Handle unequal length move lists
3. Consider probabilistic versions of moves
4. Add neural network integration for adaptive players

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No probabilistic facts | Limited functionality | Add probabilistic move choices |
| 2 | No input validation | May crash on invalid moves | Add move validation predicate |
| 3 | Assumes equal list lengths | Undefined behavior for unequal lists | Add length check or padding |

**Word Count:** 498 words

The implementation correctly handles the basic rock-paper-scissors game logic with proper recursive processing and result calculation. While it meets all classical Prolog requirements, it doesn't utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features or DeepProbLog capabilities, which could be areas for future enhancement.
