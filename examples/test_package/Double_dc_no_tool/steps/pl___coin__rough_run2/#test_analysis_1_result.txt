# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that models coin tossing experiments. The code defines probabilistic coins and recursively counts heads from multiple tosses. The purpose is to verify correct probabilistic reasoning, recursive logic, and compliance with requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show probability distributions for getting 0 to 4 heads when tossing 4 coins with P(heads)=0.8:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```
All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly follow binomial distribution probabilities for n=4, p=0.8.

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. The recursive counting logic and probabilistic facts are correctly implemented.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly handles base case (CNT=0) and two recursive cases (coin head/tail)
   - Termination is guaranteed as CNT decreases by 1 in each recursive call

2. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - The probability calculation follows P(¬A)=1−P(A) when `\+ coin(CNT)` is used
   - Results match binomial probability formula: P(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
   - For total(3): C(4,3)*0.8³*0.2¹ = 4*0.512*0.2 = 0.4096 (matches output)

3. **DeepProbLog Features**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Correct recursive counting
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Accurate binomial distribution
   - Neural integration: Not required

2. **Edge Cases Verified**:
   - Base case (CNT=0) properly terminates recursion
   - Negative CNT prevented by CNT > 0 checks
   - Probability values properly normalized

```prolog
% Correct implementation snippet:
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(CNT), % P(heads)=0.8
    SC1 is SC + 1,
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC1,S,CNT1).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    \+ coin(CNT), % P(tails)=0.2
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC,S,CNT1).
```

The implementation correctly models the probabilistic coin tossing scenario with proper recursive counting and probability calculations. All test cases match expected binomial distribution results.
