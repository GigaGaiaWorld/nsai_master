# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models the scenario where a contestant selects a door (always door 1), the host opens another door following specific rules, and calculates the probabilities of winning by either keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All test results match the expected probabilities for the Monty Hall problem:
- Equal 1/3 probability for each door having the prize
- 1/3 chance to win by keeping the original choice
- 2/3 chance to win by switching

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results correctly reflect the known mathematical solution to the Monty Hall problem.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
1. Random prize placement (equal probability)
2. Host behavior rules (random when both remaining doors are empty, forced when one has prize)
3. Win condition calculations for both strategies

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. Prize distribution: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for each door (lines 1-2)
2. Host behavior rules correctly implement conditional probabilities:
   - When both remaining doors are empty: random 50/50 choice (lines 5-6)
   - When one remaining door has prize: forced choice of empty door (lines 8-9)
3. Win conditions properly calculate:
   - `P(win_keep) = P(prize(1)) = 1/3` (line 11)
   - `P(win_switch) = 1 - P(win_keep) = 2/3` (lines 13-15)

The implementation correctly handles probabilistic negation and conditional probabilities without any logical flaws.

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets the requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct logical rules for host behavior
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurate probability calculations
- **Edge cases**: Proper handling of all door selection scenarios

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network integration was required or implemented.

The implementation is robust against edge cases:
- Fixed initial selection (door 1) simplifies without loss of generality
- Mutual exclusion properly handled in host door opening rules
- All possible prize distributions accounted for
