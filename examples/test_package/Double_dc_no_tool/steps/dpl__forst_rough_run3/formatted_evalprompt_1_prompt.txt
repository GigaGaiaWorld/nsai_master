stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of stack operations including sort, push, pop, dup, swap, over, and rot. The code was tested with various queries to verify its functionality in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
```

**All tests failed** (all queries returned 0.0000 probability). The implementation only contains the `sort` operation, while tests include other unimplemented operations.

## Failure Localization
1. **All non-sort operations** (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot):
   - Error: Missing implementations for these operations
   - Code location: Entire codebase (only sort operation is implemented)

2. **Implemented sort operation**:
   - Works correctly when tested separately
   - Code location: Lines 1-8 (the entire implemented code block)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Context**:
   - The implemented `sort` operation is logically correct
   - Recursive predicates (`insertion_sort/3`, `insert/3`) properly terminate
   - Missing implementations for other required operations

2. **ProbLog Context**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the implementation
   - All queries return 0.0000 because the operations are undefined
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are used

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used" - no neural network integration present

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Only the sort operation is correctly implemented
   - Other required stack operations are missing
   - No probabilistic reasoning implemented
   - No neural network integration

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Empty stack cases not tested
   - Stack underflow scenarios not considered
   - Performance with large stacks untested

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing push operation | All push queries fail | Implement push/3 predicate |
| 2 | Missing pop operation | All pop queries fail | Implement pop/2 predicate |
| 3 | Missing dup operation | All dup queries fail | Implement dup/2 predicate |
| 4 | Missing swap operation | All swap queries fail | Implement swap/2 predicate |
| 5 | Missing over operation | All over queries fail | Implement over/2 predicate |
| 6 | Missing rot operation | All rot queries fail | Implement rot/2 predicate |
| 7 | No probabilistic facts | Limited to classical Prolog | Add probabilistic rules if needed |
| 8 | No neural integration | No DeepProbLog features | Consider adding nn/3 if required |

**Word count**: 423 words

The implementation currently only satisfies a small portion of the requirements. The core sorting functionality works correctly, but all other stack operations need to be implemented to meet the full specification. The code would benefit from proper error handling for edge cases and could be enhanced with probabilistic reasoning if required by the project specifications.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
