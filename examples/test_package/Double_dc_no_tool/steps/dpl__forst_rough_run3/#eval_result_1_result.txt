  "ErrorSummary": "Missing implementations for push, pop, dup, swap, over, and rot operations; Only sort operation is implemented; No probabilistic reasoning implemented",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Implement missing stack operations (push/3, pop/2, dup/2, swap/2, over/2, rot/2). 2. Add probabilistic rules if required. 3. Consider adding neural network integration for DeepProbLog if needed.",
