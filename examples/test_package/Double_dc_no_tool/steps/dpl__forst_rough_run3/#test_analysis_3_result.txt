# Code Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of stack operations including sort, push, pop, dup, swap, over, and rot. The primary purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against test queries and analyze any failures.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
```

**All tests failed** (probability 0.0000 for all queries). The implementation only contains the `sort` operation (lines 1-10), while tests query other unimplemented operations.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Queries**:
   - All operations except `sort`: push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot
2. **Missing Implementations**:
   - No predicates exist for any stack operations except `sort`
   - The `sort` operation itself is only partially implemented (only handles top 3 elements)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Analysis**:
   - The existing `sort` implementation is logically correct for its limited scope
   - Recursive predicates (`insertion_sort/3`, `insert/3`) properly terminate
   - Missing base cases for other stack operations cause universal failures

2. **Probabilistic Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - All queries return 0.0000 because no matching rules exist
   - The implementation is purely deterministic Prolog-style

3. **DeepProbLog Check**:
   - **DeepProbLog feature not used** (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Fulfillment**:
   - Functional requirements: **Not met** (only sort operation partially implemented)
   - Classical reasoning: Partial (only for sort)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural integration: Not implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling of empty stacks
   - No input validation (non-list inputs would fail)
   - Sort operation only processes exactly 3 elements
   - No error handling for operations on stacks smaller than 3 elements

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing stack operations | All non-sort queries fail | Implement all required operations |
| 2 | Limited sort functionality | Only sorts top 3 elements | Modify to handle arbitrary stack sizes |
| 3 | No probabilistic features | Pure Prolog implementation | Add probabilistic facts/rules if needed |
| 4 | No edge case handling | Fails on edge cases | Add input validation and empty stack handling |

**Recommendations**:
1. Implement all required stack operations
2. Extend sort to handle arbitrary stack sizes
3. Add proper error handling for edge cases
4. Consider adding probabilistic features if required by specifications
