# Code Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of stack operations including sort, push, pop, dup, swap, over, and rot. The code was tested with various queries to verify its functionality in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
stack_op(push(1),[2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(pop,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(dup,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(swap,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(over,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
stack_op(rot,[1, 2, 3, 4],X2) = 0.0000
```

**All tests failed** (all queries returned 0.0000 probability). The implementation only contains the `sort` operation, while tests include other unimplemented operations.

## Failure Localization
1. **All non-sort operations** (push, pop, dup, swap, over, rot):
   - Error: Missing implementations for these operations
   - Code location: Entire codebase (only sort operation is implemented)

2. **Implemented sort operation**:
   - Works correctly when tested separately
   - Code location: Lines 1-8 (the entire implemented code block)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Context**:
   - The implemented `sort` operation is logically correct
   - Recursive predicates (`insertion_sort/3`, `insert/3`) properly terminate
   - Missing implementations for other required operations

2. **ProbLog Context**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the implementation
   - All queries return 0.0000 because the operations are undefined
   - No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are used

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used" - no neural network integration present

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Only the sort operation is correctly implemented
   - Other required stack operations are missing
   - No probabilistic reasoning implemented
   - No neural network integration

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Empty stack cases not tested
   - Stack underflow scenarios not considered
   - Performance with large stacks untested

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing push operation | All push queries fail | Implement push/3 predicate |
| 2 | Missing pop operation | All pop queries fail | Implement pop/2 predicate |
| 3 | Missing dup operation | All dup queries fail | Implement dup/2 predicate |
| 4 | Missing swap operation | All swap queries fail | Implement swap/2 predicate |
| 5 | Missing over operation | All over queries fail | Implement over/2 predicate |
| 6 | Missing rot operation | All rot queries fail | Implement rot/2 predicate |
| 7 | No probabilistic facts | Limited to classical Prolog | Add probabilistic rules if needed |
| 8 | No neural integration | No DeepProbLog features | Consider adding nn/3 if required |

**Word count**: 423 words

The implementation currently only satisfies a small portion of the requirements. The core sorting functionality works correctly, but all other stack operations need to be implemented to meet the full specification. The code would benefit from proper error handling for edge cases and could be enhanced with probabilistic reasoning if required by the project specifications.
