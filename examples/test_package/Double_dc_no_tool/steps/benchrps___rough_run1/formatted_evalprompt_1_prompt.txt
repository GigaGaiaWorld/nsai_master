</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on the correctness of game rules, outcome determination, and scoring logic. The analysis verifies classical reasoning aspects and checks for proper handling of edge cases.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly identifies player2 as the winner (2 losses and 1 win for player1 results in net score of -1).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Basic move definitions (lines 3-5)
2. Beat relationships (lines 7-9)
3. Outcome determination (lines 13-15)
4. Game playing recursion (lines 17-20)
5. Score computation (lines 22-25)
6. Winner determination (lines 26-31)

## Root Cause Analysis
The classical Problog implementation shows correct logical structure:
1. **Termination:** The recursive `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates properly handle base cases
2. **Logical Correctness:** 
   - All possible outcomes (win/lose/draw) are covered
   - Score computation correctly aggregates results
   - Winner determination properly interprets the final score

Probabilistic aspects are not heavily used in this implementation (no probabilistic facts or rules). The single test case shows deterministic behavior with probability 1.0000.

**DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning about the rock-paper-scissors game. Key observations:

1. **Edge Case Coverage:**
   - Handles empty move lists correctly
   - Properly scores consecutive draws
   - Correctly aggregates multiple rounds

2. **Potential Improvements:**
   - Could add input validation for move legality
   - Might benefit from probabilistic extensions (e.g., modeling player tendencies)
   - Could add more test cases for mixed results

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | Consider adding more test cases |
| 2 | DeepProbLog not utilized | Limited functionality | Consider neural player modeling |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation predicate |

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation is logically sound for the given requirements, with opportunities for extension in probabilistic modeling and input validation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
