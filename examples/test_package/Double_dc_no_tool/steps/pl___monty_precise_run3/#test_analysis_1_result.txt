# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant chooses between keeping their initial door selection or switching after one empty door is revealed. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning and ensure correct implementation of the game's rules.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform 1/3 probability distribution for the prize location
2. Fixed initial selection of door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- Prize distribution (lines 1-2) correctly implements uniform probability
- Door selection (line 3) is properly fixed
- The two `open_door` rules (hash E2FA63E7 and B4161B21) correctly handle both scenarios of available doors
- Win conditions (`win_keep` and `win_switch`) properly calculate the probabilities

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic principles:
1. Prize distribution: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for each door
2. Negation handling: `\+ prize(A)` correctly computes `1-P(prize(A))`
3. Conditional probability: The host's door opening follows the game's rules
4. Probability aggregation: The win probabilities correctly sum possible scenarios

Classical Prolog aspects are sound:
- The `member/2` predicate has proper base and recursive cases
- All rules have proper termination conditions
- No infinite recursion paths exist

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct handling of door selection and constraints
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurate probability calculations throughout
- **Edge cases**: Properly handles both scenarios (one or two available doors)

Potential improvements:
1. Could generalize `select_door` to allow any initial choice
2. Could add validation for door numbers
3. Could make the prize count configurable

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Implementation correct |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Consider generalizing initial selection |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Add input validation |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic reasoning and no logical flaws. All test cases pass as expected, demonstrating proper understanding and application of ProbLog principles.
