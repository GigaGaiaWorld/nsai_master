# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code should correctly model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for both "keep" and "switch" strategies.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:159
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate definition (lines 6-159 in the original code). The parser encountered an unexpected `->` operator without proper context, suggesting a syntax error in the conditional statement.

Key problematic elements:
1. The `->` operator is not properly formatted in the conditional blocks
2. The probabilistic facts (0.5::open_door(A)) are incorrectly placed within the conditional

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation fails due to:
1. **Syntax Errors**: The conditional statements in `open_door/1` don't follow proper ProbLog syntax for probabilistic conditionals
2. **Probabilistic Fact Placement**: Probabilistic facts cannot be dynamically assigned within rules - they must be defined at the top level
3. **Logical Structure**: The implementation attempts to mix deterministic and probabilistic choices incorrectly

Probabilistic rules violation:
- The code tries to create dynamic probabilistic facts (0.5::open_door(A)), which isn't allowed in ProbLog
- The correct approach would be to define all possible outcomes as separate probabilistic facts

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Not achieved due to compilation errors
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax issues
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Missed:**
- No handling for invalid door selections
- No validation of input types
- The dynamic probability assignment anti-pattern

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid conditional syntax in `open_door/1` | Code cannot compile | Rewrite using proper ProbLog conditionals |
| 2 | Dynamic probabilistic fact assignment | Violates ProbLog semantics | Predefine all possible outcomes |
| 3 | Missing base cases | Potential infinite recursion | Add proper termination conditions |
| 4 | No input validation | May fail on invalid inputs | Add type checking predicates |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Corrected open_door implementation
open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    find_available_doors(Selected, AvailableDoors),
    random_member(A, AvailableDoors).

find_available_doors(Selected, Doors) :-
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), Doors).

% Alternative probabilistic approach
0.5::open_door_a(1); 0.5::open_door_a(2).
open_door(D) :- condition_two_doors, open_door_a(D).
open_door(D) :- condition_one_door, available_door(D).
```

The corrected version should properly handle the probabilistic nature of the host's choice while maintaining logical consistency with the Monty Hall problem rules.
