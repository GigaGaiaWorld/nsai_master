# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the player decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and compliance with the specified requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:158
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error. The system failed to process any of the defined queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`).

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-158 in the code block with hash 751033ED). The specific issues are:

1. Syntax error in the conditional probability statement `0.5::open_door(Door)`
2. Missing proper clause definitions for the probabilistic choice between doors
3. Improper handling of the probabilistic fact within a rule body

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation violates several ProbLog requirements:

1. **Logical Structure**: The attempt to use `0.5::open_door(Door)` inside a rule body is invalid syntax. Probabilistic facts must be defined at the top level.

2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The implementation fails to properly model the host's behavior:
   - When two doors are available, it should create a proper probabilistic choice
   - When one door is available, it should deterministically select it

3. **Negation Handling**: The use of `\+` in `\+ prize(D)` and `\+ open_door(A)` is correct in principle, but the overall structure prevents proper evaluation.

## Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet its functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Partially implemented but non-functional due to syntax errors
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Incorrect implementation of probabilistic choices
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Key edge cases not properly handled:
- No validation of door selection inputs
- No handling of cases where all doors might have prizes (though impossible per problem definition)
- No proper probabilistic choice mechanism between available doors

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid probabilistic fact syntax in rule body | Code cannot execute | Move probabilistic choices to top level or use proper ProbLog syntax for probabilistic rules |
| 2 | Incomplete implementation of host's door selection logic | Requirements not fully met | Implement separate probabilistic facts for each possible door combination |
| 3 | Missing validation of input parameters | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for valid door numbers and prize assignments |
| 4 | Improper handling of deterministic case | Incorrect behavior when only one door available | Simplify the deterministic case without probabilistic annotation |

The implementation requires significant restructuring to properly model the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic nature while maintaining correct logical flow. The core issue stems from misunderstanding ProbLog's syntax for combining probabilistic facts with logical rules.
