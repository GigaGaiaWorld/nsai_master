# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code should correctly model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical error during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:139
```
The system failed to execute any queries due to this syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-139 in the original code). The problematic section is:
```prolog
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected), 
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), Doors), 
    length(Doors, Len), 
    (Len =:= 2 -> member(D, Doors), 0.5::open_door(D) ; Len =:= 1 -> [D] = Doors).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate contains invalid syntax with the probability annotation `0.5::open_door(D)` appearing in the middle of the clause body. In ProbLog, probabilistic facts must be declared at the top level, not within rule bodies.

2. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic (random selection between two available doors) isn't correctly implemented due to the syntax error. The correct approach would be to define separate probabilistic facts for each case.

3. **Probabilistic Rules Violation**: The current implementation doesn't properly maintain the probabilistic relationships required by the problem (P(¬A)=1−P(A)).

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but broken by syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not correctly implemented due to syntax issues
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code doesn't handle cases where the player's selected door might contain the prize
   - No protection against invalid door numbers
   - The recursive member/2 predicate could cause issues with non-list inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid probability annotation in rule body | Code fails to execute | Move probabilistic facts to top level |
| 2 | Missing case handling in open_door/1 | Incomplete logic | Implement separate clauses for each case |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add guards for door numbers |

## Recommended Fix
```prolog
% Corrected implementation
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), Doors),
    length(Doors, Len),
    (Len =:= 2 -> random_member(D, Doors)
    ; Len =:= 1 -> [D] = Doors).

% Alternative probabilistic approach
1/2::open_door_a(1) ; 1/2::open_door_a(2).
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), [A,B]),
    open_door_a(Choice), (Choice =:= 1 -> D = A ; D = B).
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), [D]).
```

The corrected version separates the probabilistic choice from the logical structure and handles both cases (one or two available doors) appropriately.
