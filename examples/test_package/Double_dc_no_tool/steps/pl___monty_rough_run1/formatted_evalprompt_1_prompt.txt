</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code should correctly model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for both "keep" and "switch" strategies.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:159
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate definition (lines 6-159 in the original code). The parser encountered an unexpected `->` operator without proper context, suggesting a syntax error in the conditional statement.

Key problematic elements:
1. The `->` operator is not properly formatted in the conditional blocks
2. The probabilistic facts (0.5::open_door(A)) are incorrectly placed within the conditional

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation fails due to:
1. **Syntax Errors**: The conditional statements in `open_door/1` don't follow proper ProbLog syntax for probabilistic conditionals
2. **Probabilistic Fact Placement**: Probabilistic facts cannot be dynamically assigned within rules - they must be defined at the top level
3. **Logical Structure**: The implementation attempts to mix deterministic and probabilistic choices incorrectly

Probabilistic rules violation:
- The code tries to create dynamic probabilistic facts (0.5::open_door(A)), which isn't allowed in ProbLog
- The correct approach would be to define all possible outcomes as separate probabilistic facts

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Not achieved due to compilation errors
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax issues
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Missed:**
- No handling for invalid door selections
- No validation of input types
- The dynamic probability assignment anti-pattern

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid conditional syntax in `open_door/1` | Code cannot compile | Rewrite using proper ProbLog conditionals |
| 2 | Dynamic probabilistic fact assignment | Violates ProbLog semantics | Predefine all possible outcomes |
| 3 | Missing base cases | Potential infinite recursion | Add proper termination conditions |
| 4 | No input validation | May fail on invalid inputs | Add type checking predicates |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Corrected open_door implementation
open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    find_available_doors(Selected, AvailableDoors),
    random_member(A, AvailableDoors).

find_available_doors(Selected, Doors) :-
    findall(D, (member(D,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(D), D \= Selected), Doors).

% Alternative probabilistic approach
0.5::open_door_a(1); 0.5::open_door_a(2).
open_door(D) :- condition_two_doors, open_door_a(D).
open_door(D) :- condition_one_door, available_door(D).
```

The corrected version should properly handle the probabilistic nature of the host's choice while maintaining logical consistency with the Monty Hall problem rules.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
