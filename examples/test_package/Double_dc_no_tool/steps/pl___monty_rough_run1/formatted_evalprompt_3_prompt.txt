</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the player decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and compliance with the specified requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model: UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:158
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error. The system failed to process any of the defined queries (`prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, `win_keep`, `win_switch`).

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-158 in the code block with hash 751033ED). The specific issues are:

1. Syntax error in the conditional probability statement `0.5::open_door(Door)`
2. Missing proper clause definitions for the probabilistic choice between doors
3. Improper handling of the probabilistic fact within a rule body

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation violates several ProbLog requirements:

1. **Logical Structure**: The attempt to use `0.5::open_door(Door)` inside a rule body is invalid syntax. Probabilistic facts must be defined at the top level.

2. **Probabilistic Rules**: The implementation fails to properly model the host's behavior:
   - When two doors are available, it should create a proper probabilistic choice
   - When one door is available, it should deterministically select it

3. **Negation Handling**: The use of `\+` in `\+ prize(D)` and `\+ open_door(A)` is correct in principle, but the overall structure prevents proper evaluation.

## Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet its functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Partially implemented but non-functional due to syntax errors
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Incorrect implementation of probabilistic choices
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Key edge cases not properly handled:
- No validation of door selection inputs
- No handling of cases where all doors might have prizes (though impossible per problem definition)
- No proper probabilistic choice mechanism between available doors

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid probabilistic fact syntax in rule body | Code cannot execute | Move probabilistic choices to top level or use proper ProbLog syntax for probabilistic rules |
| 2 | Incomplete implementation of host's door selection logic | Requirements not fully met | Implement separate probabilistic facts for each possible door combination |
| 3 | Missing validation of input parameters | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for valid door numbers and prize assignments |
| 4 | Improper handling of deterministic case | Incorrect behavior when only one door available | Simplify the deterministic case without probabilistic annotation |

The implementation requires significant restructuring to properly model the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic nature while maintaining correct logical flow. The core issue stems from misunderstanding ProbLog's syntax for combining probabilistic facts with logical rules.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
