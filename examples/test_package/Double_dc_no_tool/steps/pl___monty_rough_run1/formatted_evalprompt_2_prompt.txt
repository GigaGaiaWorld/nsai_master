problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:139.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code should correctly model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical error during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:139
```
The system failed to execute any queries due to this syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-139 in the original code). The problematic section is:
```prolog
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected), 
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), Doors), 
    length(Doors, Len), 
    (Len =:= 2 -> member(D, Doors), 0.5::open_door(D) ; Len =:= 1 -> [D] = Doors).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate contains invalid syntax with the probability annotation `0.5::open_door(D)` appearing in the middle of the clause body. In ProbLog, probabilistic facts must be declared at the top level, not within rule bodies.

2. **Logical Structure**: The intended logic (random selection between two available doors) isn't correctly implemented due to the syntax error. The correct approach would be to define separate probabilistic facts for each case.

3. **Probabilistic Rules Violation**: The current implementation doesn't properly maintain the probabilistic relationships required by the problem (P(¬A)=1−P(A)).

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but broken by syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not correctly implemented due to syntax issues
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code doesn't handle cases where the player's selected door might contain the prize
   - No protection against invalid door numbers
   - The recursive member/2 predicate could cause issues with non-list inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid probability annotation in rule body | Code fails to execute | Move probabilistic facts to top level |
| 2 | Missing case handling in open_door/1 | Incomplete logic | Implement separate clauses for each case |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add guards for door numbers |

## Recommended Fix
```prolog
% Corrected implementation
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), Doors),
    length(Doors, Len),
    (Len =:= 2 -> random_member(D, Doors)
    ; Len =:= 1 -> [D] = Doors).

% Alternative probabilistic approach
1/2::open_door_a(1) ; 1/2::open_door_a(2).
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), [A,B]),
    open_door_a(Choice), (Choice =:= 1 -> D = A ; D = B).
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), [D]).
```

The corrected version separates the probabilistic choice from the logical structure and handles both cases (one or two available doors) appropriately.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
