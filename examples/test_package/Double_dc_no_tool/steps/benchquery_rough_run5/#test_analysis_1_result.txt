# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program uses population and area data to calculate densities and compare them. The evaluation focuses on functionality, error analysis, and compliance with requirements.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure:
```
Error: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7
```
The program fails because the required `query_pop/1` predicate is not implemented, despite being specified in the requirements.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `query(query_pop(_))`
   - **Location**: Line 59
   - **Problem**: Missing implementation of `query_pop/1` predicate
   - **Expected**: Should find country pairs with similar population densities
   - **Actual**: Error due to undefined predicate

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issues are:
1. The `density/2` predicate is correctly defined but never used in a query.
2. The required `query_pop/1` predicate is completely missing.
3. No comparison mechanism exists to find countries with similar densities (within 5%).

The program fails at the classical Prolog level due to these structural omissions. No probabilistic features or DeepProbLog elements are used in this code.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- ❌ Classical reasoning: Partially implemented (density calculation works but query missing)
- ❌ Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
- ❌ Neural network integration: Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used)

**Edge Cases Not Handled**:
1. Countries with zero area would cause division errors (currently prevented by `Area > 0`)
2. No handling for missing country data
3. No input validation for the query

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `query_pop/1` implementation | Complete failure | Implement as specified in requirements |
| 2 | No density comparison mechanism | Cannot find similar countries | Add comparison predicate with 5% threshold |
| 3 | Unused `density/2` predicate | Wasted functionality | Incorporate into main query |

## Corrective Action Recommendations
```prolog
% Add this to implement the required functionality
query_pop([Country1,Density1,Country2,Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    Diff is abs(Density1 - Density2),
    MaxDiff is 0.05 * max(Density1, Density2),
    Diff =< MaxDiff.
```

The solution requires:
1. Implementing the missing `query_pop/1` predicate
2. Adding the density comparison logic
3. Maintaining the existing correct density calculation

**Word Count**: 398 words (including code blocks and tables)

The evaluation shows the program is incomplete but structurally sound for the implemented parts. The main deficiency is the missing query predicate that would tie the functionality together as specified in the requirements.
