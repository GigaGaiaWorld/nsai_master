# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program calculates population density from given population and area facts, then finds country pairs meeting the density similarity criterion.

## Test Results Summary
All test cases passed successfully:
```
query_pop([china, 244.0828402366864, france, 246.4788732394366]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223.859649122807, pakistan, 219.2926045016077]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477.58620689655174, philippines, 461.1111111111111]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77.71428571428571, mexico, 76.04712041884817]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly calculates densities and finds matching pairs within the specified 5% threshold.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The implementation meets all requirements:
1. Correctly defines `density/2` predicate (lines 1-3)
2. Properly implements `query_pop/1` with all constraints (lines 4-5)
3. Includes all necessary population and area facts (lines 8-34)

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - Density calculation: `Density is (Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000)` properly converts units
   - Comparison: `abs(Density1 - Density2) / min(Density1, Density2) =< 0.05` correctly implements 5% threshold
   - Uniqueness: `Country1 @< Country2` prevents duplicate pairs

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used (pure classical Prolog)
   - All queries return probability 1.0000 as expected for deterministic facts
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
- Neural network integration: Not required

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. Unit conversion in density calculation handles large numbers correctly
2. Country pair uniqueness enforced via alphabetical comparison
3. Relative difference calculation prevents division by zero (min used as denominator)

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Add input validation for non-existent countries
2. Consider adding probabilistic population estimates
3. Could optimize by pre-calculating densities

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements for classical ProbLog programming. The density calculation and comparison logic are robust, and all test cases pass as expected. No errors or warnings were detected during evaluation.
