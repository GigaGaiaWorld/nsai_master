    raise UnmatchedCharacter(string, expr_stack[-1].start.location)
problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character '(' at 7:1.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a probabilistic head probability of 0.8. The program counts successful heads outcomes (SC) through recursive processing of CNT coins, accumulating results in S. The evaluation focuses on syntax correctness, logical flow, and probabilistic computation.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error:
```
Unmatched character '(' at 7:1
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this fundamental syntax issue. The error occurs before any probabilistic computation can begin.

## 3. Failure Localization
The error originates from improper syntax in the recursive rule `coins_r/3`:
- Location: Line 7, starting with `(coin(CNT) ->`
- Problem: Missing opening parenthesis for the entire conditional statement
- Impact: Prevents the entire program from being parsed

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues identified are:

1. **Syntax Error**:
   - The conditional statement is improperly formatted
   - ProbLog requires proper parenthetical grouping for conditionals

2. **Structural Problems**:
   ```prolog
   (coin(CNT) -> 
        NewSC is SC + 1,
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT)
   ;
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT).
   ```
   Should be properly nested as:
   ```prolog
   ( (coin(CNT)) -> 
        NewSC is SC + 1,
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT)
   ;
        NewCNT is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT)
   ).
   ```

3. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - The probabilistic fact declaration `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` appears incomplete
   - The probability annotation format needs verification

## 5. Overall Analysis
The current implementation fails to meet basic requirements due to syntax errors. Key observations:

- **Functional Requirements**: Not met due to uncompilable code
- **Edge Cases**: Recursive termination appears correct in design but untestable
- **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unmatched parenthesis in conditional | Code cannot parse | Add proper nesting for conditionals |
| 2 | Incomplete probabilistic fact | Undefined probability behavior | Clarify PH::make_coin declaration |
| 3 | Improper rule formatting | Logical flow broken | Reformat entire coins_r predicate |

**Word Count**: 398

**Recommendation**: Fix the syntax errors and verify the probabilistic fact declarations before testing the logical behavior. The recursive structure appears conceptually sound but requires proper implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
