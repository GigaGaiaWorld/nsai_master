# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a biased probability (0.8 for heads). The program should recursively count successful heads outcomes over 4 coin tosses. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and proper implementation of recursive counting.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12
```
No successful queries were executed due to this compilation error. The program failed before reaching any probabilistic computation stage.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate between lines 7-12. The specific issue is:
- Invalid syntax for conditional logic using `->` operator
- Missing proper if-then-else structure in the recursive counting implementation
- The code block attempting to use `->` without proper ProbLog syntax

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: ProbLog requires proper if-then-else structure (`(Condition -> Then ; Else)`), but the current implementation has malformed syntax.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: While the program defines a probabilistic coin (0.8 bias), the counting mechanism fails before probability computation occurs.
3. **Recursive Logic**: The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined, but the recursive case contains the syntax error.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is present in this code ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Overall Analysis
The program fails to meet its functional requirements due to the syntax error. Key observations:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: The recursive structure is conceptually correct but syntactically invalid.
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The coin definition is properly probabilistic, but the counting mechanism never executes.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code doesn't handle cases like:
   - Negative counter values
   - Non-integer inputs
   - Undefined coin instances

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid conditional syntax | Program fails to compile | Use proper ProbLog if-then-else: `(coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC)` |
| 2 | Missing operator definition | Cannot evaluate conditions | Ensure proper operator definitions are in scope |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add guards for counter values |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).

coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).

total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).
```

The corrected version properly implements the conditional logic and should execute as intended, counting heads from 4 biased coin tosses with 0.8 probability for each head.
