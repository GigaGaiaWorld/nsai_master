# Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog: Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant selects between three doors with one containing a prize. The host then opens a door, and the contestant decides whether to keep their original choice or switch. The implementation should correctly model the probabilistic nature of this scenario.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform 1/3 probability distribution for the prize location
2. Fixed initial selection of door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the original choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates correctly implement the Monty Hall problem logic:
- `open_door/1` rules (lines 5-12) correctly handle both scenarios (two empty doors or one empty/one prize door)
- `win_keep` (line 14) and `win_switch` (lines 16-19) correctly calculate winning probabilities
- All expansion predicates are correctly defined

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation satisfies all probabilistic requirements:
1. Prize distribution: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for Xâˆˆ{1,2,3} (line 1)
2. Host behavior:
   - When two empty doors: random 50/50 choice (lines 5-7)
   - When one empty door: deterministic choice of empty door (lines 9-12)
3. Winning conditions:
   - `P(win_keep) = P(prize(1)) = 1/3` (correct)
   - `P(win_switch) = 2/3` (correct via complement)

No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) were used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets functional requirements:
1. Classical reasoning: Correct logical relationships between doors/prizes
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Accurate probability calculations
3. Edge cases handled:
   - All possible prize locations covered
   - All host behavior scenarios modeled
   - Fixed initial selection doesn't affect generality

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | - |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic outcomes. The 2:1 advantage of switching strategies is properly reflected in the results, confirming the implementation's correctness.
