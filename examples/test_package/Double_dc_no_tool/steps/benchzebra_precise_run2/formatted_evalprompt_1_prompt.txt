</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires determining the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given clues about nationalities, colors, drinks, cigarettes, and pets. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness and completeness of the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows one successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,water,kools,fox), 
       house(ukrainian,blue,tea,chesterfields,horse), 
       house(english,red,milk,winstons,snail), 
       house(spanish,ivory,orange_juice,lucky_strikes,dog), 
       house(japanese,green,coffee,parliaments,zebra)]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution correctly satisfies all puzzle constraints and returns the expected house arrangement with full probability (1.0000).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and work together to satisfy all puzzle constraints.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The implementation correctly encodes all puzzle constraints:
   - Positional constraints (middle house drinks milk, first house is Norwegian)
   - Relational constraints (right_of, next_to)
   - Property constraints (nationality-color-drink-cigarette-pet associations)

2. **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) properly handle base cases and recursive cases, ensuring termination.

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: While the solution uses Problog syntax, it doesn't utilize probabilistic features - all facts are deterministic. The probability 1.0000 indicates certainty in the solution.

4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) was used in this solution. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used".

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
- Correctly solves the logical puzzle
- Handles all constraint types (unary, binary, positional)
- Properly manages list operations and recursive searches

**Edge Cases Considered**:
- Middle house position explicitly set (line with `Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, milk, _, _), _, _]`)
- Norwegian in first house explicitly set (line with `Houses = [house(norwegian, _, _, _, _)|_]`)
- List structure maintained throughout all operations
- Recursion depth limited to 5 (number of houses)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete for solving the Zebra Puzzle using deterministic Prolog reasoning. No errors or improvements were identified in the current solution.

**Word Count**: 398 words

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
