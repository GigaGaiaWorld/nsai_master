# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires determining the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given clues about nationalities, colors, drinks, cigarettes, and pets. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness and completeness of the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows one successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,water,kools,fox), 
       house(ukrainian,blue,tea,chesterfields,horse), 
       house(english,red,milk,winstons,snail), 
       house(spanish,ivory,orange_juice,lucky_strikes,dog), 
       house(japanese,green,coffee,parliaments,zebra)]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution correctly satisfies all puzzle constraints and returns the expected house arrangement with full probability (1.0000).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and work together to satisfy all puzzle constraints.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The implementation correctly encodes all puzzle constraints:
   - Positional constraints (middle house drinks milk, first house is Norwegian)
   - Relational constraints (right_of, next_to)
   - Property constraints (nationality-color-drink-cigarette-pet associations)

2. **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) properly handle base cases and recursive cases, ensuring termination.

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: While the solution uses Problog syntax, it doesn't utilize probabilistic features - all facts are deterministic. The probability 1.0000 indicates certainty in the solution.

4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) was used in this solution. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used".

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
- Correctly solves the logical puzzle
- Handles all constraint types (unary, binary, positional)
- Properly manages list operations and recursive searches

**Edge Cases Considered**:
- Middle house position explicitly set (line with `Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, milk, _, _), _, _]`)
- Norwegian in first house explicitly set (line with `Houses = [house(norwegian, _, _, _, _)|_]`)
- List structure maintained throughout all operations
- Recursion depth limited to 5 (number of houses)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete for solving the Zebra Puzzle using deterministic Prolog reasoning. No errors or improvements were identified in the current solution.
