# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population density from given population and area data, then finds country pairs where one density is slightly higher than another (within a 5% margin).

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 successful query results:
```
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All queries returned correct results with probability 1.0, matching the expected behavior of finding country pairs with similar population densities.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The program correctly implements:
1. Density calculation (`density/2` predicate)
2. Comparative query logic (`query_pop/1` predicate)
3. All population and area facts are properly defined

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The density calculation `D is (P*100)//A` properly computes people per 1000 square miles
2. **Comparative Logic**: The 5% margin check (`T1 is 20*D1, T2 is 21*D2, T1 < T2`) correctly implements the requirement
3. **Termination**: The program terminates as it uses finite facts and non-recursive rules

Probabilistic aspects:
- The program uses classical Prolog without probabilistic facts
- All results show probability 1.0, indicating deterministic reasoning
- **DeepProbLog feature not used**

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (classical program)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Integer division in density calculation prevents floating-point errors
2. Comparative logic handles all possible country pairs
3. No undefined predicates or infinite recursion risks

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Adding input validation for non-existent countries
2. Consider floating-point division for more precise density values
3. Extend with probabilistic population estimates

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Program meets all requirements |

The program correctly implements the specified functionality with robust handling of the population density comparison task. The test cases adequately verify the core functionality, though additional edge case testing could further strengthen verification.
