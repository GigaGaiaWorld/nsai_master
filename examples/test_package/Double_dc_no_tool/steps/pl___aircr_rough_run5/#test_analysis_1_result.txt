# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments considering actuator strength and wind effects, with probabilistic elements for actuator selection and wind conditions. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic in this safety-critical system.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical syntax error:
```
Error: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 33:219
```
No queries could be executed successfully due to this compilation error. The intended queries were:
- `goal_reached(T)` for T between 1-5
- `overrun_exception(T)` for T between 1-5

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `attempted_flap_position` predicate definition (lines 33-34). The issue stems from:
1. Improper line breaks in the predicate definition
2. Missing continuation character (`\`) for multi-line rules
3. Potential malformed if-then-else construct

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues are:

**Syntax Error**:
- The predicate is split across lines without proper Prolog continuation
- The if-then-else construct may be malformed

**Probabilistic Aspects**:
- While not reached, the probabilistic facts (actuator selection, wind models) appear correctly defined
- Probability distributions sum to 1 for all probabilistic choices

**Classical Logic**:
- Recursive time steps appear logically sound in intent
- Termination condition (`goal_reached`) is properly defined

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements**:
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (logically sound but syntactically invalid)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly modeled but not testable
- DeepProbLog: Feature not used

**Edge Cases**:
- Wind effect boundaries not explicitly handled
- No validation for actuator strength values
- Time bounds are fixed (0-5) which may be too restrictive

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed predicate definition | Code cannot execute | Fix line continuation and if-then-else syntax |
| 2 | Missing edge case handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for positions/strengths |
| 3 | Fixed time bounds | Limits model flexibility | Make time bound configurable |

**Corrected Code Block**:
```prolog
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time-1,
    flap_position(Prev,PrevPos),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time,Actuator),
    actuator_strength(Actuator,Strength),
    wind_effect(Time,WindEffect),
    goal(Target),
    Delta is Target - PrevPos,
    (   abs(Delta) =< Strength -> Move is Delta
    ;   Delta > 0 -> Move is Strength
    ;   Move is -Strength
    ),
    Pos is PrevPos + Move + WindEffect.
```

The evaluation concludes that while the logical design appears sound, immediate attention is needed to fix the syntax errors before probabilistic behavior can be properly verified. The core probabilistic model shows good potential for correct operation once these structural issues are resolved.
