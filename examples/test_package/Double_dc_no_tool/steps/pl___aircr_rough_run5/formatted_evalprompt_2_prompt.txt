<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under wind effects using probabilistic actuators. The system aims to move flaps from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps while handling potential overrun exceptions.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test queries returned valid probability distributions:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for `goal_reached` while `overrun_exception` shows a realistic pattern of increasing then slightly decreasing probabilities.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures detected. Key predicates function correctly:
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (Lines 18-25) properly calculates new positions
- `wind_effect/2` (Lines 9-10) correctly models wind distributions
- Actuator selection (Line 7) maintains proper probability distribution

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The recursive position calculation terminates when `goal_reached` succeeds
- Wind effect probabilities sum to 1 for both weak/strong cases (0.25+0.5+0.25 and 0.2+0.3+0.3+0.2)
- Actuator selection follows P(A)+P(B)=1 (0.5+0.5)

**Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**
- Negation in `\+ legal_flap_position` correctly implements P(¬A)
- All joint probabilities are properly calculated through ProbLog's inference

**DeepProbLog:** Feature not used in this implementation.

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Correct position calculation and goal checking
- Probabilistic reasoning: Valid handling of actuator/wind uncertainties
- Neural integration: Not applicable (no `nn/3` calls)

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Overrun detection via `legal_flap_position` check
- Time-bound execution via `at(5)` constraint
- Proper initialization with `flap_position(0,6)`

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add bounds checking for extreme wind effects
2. Consider actuator failure probabilities
3. Add visualization of position probability distributions

% Key Functional Block (Hash: A5C06F43)
attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :- 
    Time > 0, 
    Prev is Time-1, 
    \+ goal_reached(Prev), 
    flap_position(Prev,PrevPos), 
    goal(Target), 
    use_actuator(Time,Actuator),

    wind_effect(Time,WindEffect), 
    Direction is sign(Target - PrevPos), 
    Pos is PrevPos + (Direction * Strength) + WindEffect.
```

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
