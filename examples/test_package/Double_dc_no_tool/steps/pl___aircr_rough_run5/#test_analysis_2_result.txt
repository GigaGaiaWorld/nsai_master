# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under wind effects using probabilistic actuators. The system aims to move flaps from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps while handling potential overrun exceptions.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test queries returned valid probability distributions:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for `goal_reached` while `overrun_exception` shows a realistic pattern of increasing then slightly decreasing probabilities.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures detected. Key predicates function correctly:
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (Lines 18-25) properly calculates new positions
- `wind_effect/2` (Lines 9-10) correctly models wind distributions
- Actuator selection (Line 7) maintains proper probability distribution

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The recursive position calculation terminates when `goal_reached` succeeds
- Wind effect probabilities sum to 1 for both weak/strong cases (0.25+0.5+0.25 and 0.2+0.3+0.3+0.2)
- Actuator selection follows P(A)+P(B)=1 (0.5+0.5)

**Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**
- Negation in `\+ legal_flap_position` correctly implements P(Â¬A)
- All joint probabilities are properly calculated through ProbLog's inference

**DeepProbLog:** Feature not used in this implementation.

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Correct position calculation and goal checking
- Probabilistic reasoning: Valid handling of actuator/wind uncertainties
- Neural integration: Not applicable (no `nn/3` calls)

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Overrun detection via `legal_flap_position` check
- Time-bound execution via `at(5)` constraint
- Proper initialization with `flap_position(0,6)`

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add bounds checking for extreme wind effects
2. Consider actuator failure probabilities
3. Add visualization of position probability distributions
