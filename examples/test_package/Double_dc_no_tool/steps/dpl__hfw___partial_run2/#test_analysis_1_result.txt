# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Number Detection and Arithmetic Expression Evaluation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to:
1. Detect numbers (0-9) from image representations
2. Detect basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
3. Parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions composed of these elements
4. Handle edge cases in arithmetic operations (e.g., division by zero)

## Test Results Summary
The system was tested with one primary query:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:**
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],-10.333333333333332) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:**
The expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` evaluates to:
1. Parentheses first: 3 + 3 = 6
2. Division: 2 / 6 ≈ 0.333...
3. Multiplication: 2 * 7 = 14
4. Final operation: 0.333... - 14 ≈ -13.666...

**Discrepancy Found:** The actual result (-10.333...) doesn't match the expected result (-13.666...). This indicates a calculation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `parse/2` predicate, specifically in the subtraction handling rule:
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
 parse([-1, *|T], R2),  % This line incorrectly transforms subtraction
 almost_equal(N1 + R2, R).
```

The rule attempts to convert subtraction into addition of a negative product, which is mathematically incorrect for this expression structure.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error**: The subtraction transformation doesn't maintain proper operator precedence
2. **Classical Prolog Issues**: The recursive parsing works correctly for other operations but fails for subtraction
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: All facts have probability 1.0, so no probabilistic reasoning issues exist
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3` or `tensor` calls) was used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (fails on complex expressions)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Fully met (all facts are deterministic)
- Neural integration: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used)

**Edge Cases:**
1. Division by zero is properly handled (`N2 \== 0` check)
2. List input validation is missing (could fail on non-list inputs)
3. Operator precedence isn't fully respected in the current implementation

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect subtraction transformation | Wrong calculation results | Rewrite subtraction rule to maintain proper precedence |
| 2 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for input lists |
| 3 | No parentheses handling | Limited expression support | Implement proper parentheses parsing |

**Recommended Fix for Subtraction:**
```prolog
parse([N1,-|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    almost_equal(N1 - R2, R).
```

The evaluation reveals that while basic functionality works, the arithmetic expression parsing needs improvement to handle operator precedence correctly, particularly for subtraction operations. The probabilistic aspects are correctly implemented, but the classical reasoning component requires refinement for complex expressions.
