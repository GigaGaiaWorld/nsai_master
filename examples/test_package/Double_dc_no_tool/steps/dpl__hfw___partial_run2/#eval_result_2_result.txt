  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in core parsing logic. The module correctly implements arithmetic expression evaluation with proper operator precedence and error handling for division by zero.",
  "SuggestedFix": "None needed for core functionality. Optional enhancements could include: 1) Adding probabilistic confidence scores to detection facts, 2) Implementing neural network integration via nn/3 predicates for actual image processing, 3) Adding input validation for non-list inputs.",
