    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses and count successes. The program should recursively process coin tosses, incrementing a counter for each successful outcome (heads) based on a probabilistic coin definition. The evaluation focuses on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and error handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12
```
No queries were successfully executed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate between lines 7-12. The specific issue is with the conditional statement syntax:
```prolog
(coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC)
```
ProbLog doesn't recognize the standard Prolog `->/2` operator in this context.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: ProbLog requires different syntax for conditional probability statements than standard Prolog. The `->/2` operator isn't directly supported in probabilistic contexts.

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The intended logic would require:
   - Proper handling of probabilistic facts (coin/1)
   - Correct accumulation of probabilities through recursion
   - Proper termination condition (CNT=0)

3. **Recursive Termination**: While the base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined, the recursive case fails before execution due to syntax issues.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax error
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined behavior for negative CNT values
   - No input validation for coin probability bounds (0-1)
   - Potential stack overflow with deep recursion (though limited by CNT=4)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid conditional syntax | Complete failure | Replace with `if(coin(CNT), NSC is SC+1, NSC=SC)` |
| 2 | No probability bounds check | Potential invalid models | Add validation for PH ∈ [0,1] |
| 3 | No negative CNT handling | Undefined behavior | Add guard clause `CNT >= 0` |

**Suggested Correction**:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    if(coin(CNT), NSC is SC + 1, NSC = SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

The corrected version uses ProbLog's built-in `if/3` predicate instead of Prolog's `->/2` operator, maintaining the same logical structure while being syntactically valid in ProbLog.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
