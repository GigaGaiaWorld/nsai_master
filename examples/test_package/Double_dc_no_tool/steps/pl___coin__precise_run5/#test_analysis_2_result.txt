# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses and count successes. The program should recursively process coin tosses, incrementing a counter for each successful outcome (heads) based on a probabilistic coin definition. The evaluation focuses on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and error handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12
```
No queries were successfully executed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate between lines 7-12. The specific issue is with the conditional statement syntax:
```prolog
(coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC)
```
ProbLog doesn't recognize the standard Prolog `->/2` operator in this context.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: ProbLog requires different syntax for conditional probability statements than standard Prolog. The `->/2` operator isn't directly supported in probabilistic contexts.

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The intended logic would require:
   - Proper handling of probabilistic facts (coin/1)
   - Correct accumulation of probabilities through recursion
   - Proper termination condition (CNT=0)

3. **Recursive Termination**: While the base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined, the recursive case fails before execution due to syntax issues.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax error
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Undefined behavior for negative CNT values
   - No input validation for coin probability bounds (0-1)
   - Potential stack overflow with deep recursion (though limited by CNT=4)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid conditional syntax | Complete failure | Replace with `if(coin(CNT), NSC is SC+1, NSC=SC)` |
| 2 | No probability bounds check | Potential invalid models | Add validation for PH âˆˆ [0,1] |
| 3 | No negative CNT handling | Undefined behavior | Add guard clause `CNT >= 0` |

**Suggested Correction**:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    if(coin(CNT), NSC is SC + 1, NSC = SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

The corrected version uses ProbLog's built-in `if/3` predicate instead of Prolog's `->/2` operator, maintaining the same logical structure while being syntactically valid in ProbLog.
