# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, which should sort a list of numbers in ascending order. The code was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` to verify its correctness and functionality.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with an error message indicating an unknown clause for the `->/2` operator. The specific error was:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:12
```
No successful test results were obtained due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically in the conditional statement at line 10 (approximate location). The problematic code section is:
```prolog
(Swapped == true ->
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
;
    append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)
).
```
The ProbLog engine cannot process the standard Prolog conditional operator `->/2`.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm logic appears correct for standard Prolog, using proper recursive termination with the base case `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` and implementing a single pass through the list in `bubble_pass/4`.

2. **ProbLog Compatibility Issue**: The main problem is the use of Prolog's native conditional operator `->/2`, which isn't supported in ProbLog's syntax. ProbLog requires different syntax for conditional statements.

3. **DeepProbLog Features**: DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The code fails to meet requirements as it doesn't execute in ProbLog due to syntax incompatibility, despite having correct algorithm logic for standard Prolog.

2. **Edge Cases**: The implementation doesn't handle:
   - Non-list inputs
   - Empty lists (though the base case exists)
   - Lists with duplicate elements
   - Performance with large lists (deep recursion)

3. **ProbLog Specifics**: The code doesn't incorporate any probabilistic elements or neural network integration that ProbLog is designed for.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog doesn't support Prolog's `->/2` operator | Code cannot execute | Rewrite conditionals using ProbLog-compatible syntax |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | Doesn't utilize ProbLog's core features | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | May fail on non-list inputs | Add type checking predicates |
| 4 | No DeepProbLog integration | Limited to classical sorting | Consider adding neural network components if needed |

**Word count**: 398

The implementation needs significant modification to work in ProbLog, primarily replacing Prolog-specific syntax with ProbLog-compatible alternatives. The core sorting algorithm appears logically correct but cannot be verified until the syntax issues are resolved.
