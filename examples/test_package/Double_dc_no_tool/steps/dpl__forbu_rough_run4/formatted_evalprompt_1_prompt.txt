    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, which should sort a list of numbers in ascending order. The code was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` to verify its correctness and functionality.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with an error message indicating an unknown clause for the `->/2` operator. The specific error was:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:12
```
No successful test results were obtained due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically in the conditional statement at line 10 (approximate location). The problematic code section is:
```prolog
(Swapped == true ->
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted)
;
    append(Acc, NewList, Sorted)
).
```
The ProbLog engine cannot process the standard Prolog conditional operator `->/2`.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm logic appears correct for standard Prolog, using proper recursive termination with the base case `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` and implementing a single pass through the list in `bubble_pass/4`.

2. **ProbLog Compatibility Issue**: The main problem is the use of Prolog's native conditional operator `->/2`, which isn't supported in ProbLog's syntax. ProbLog requires different syntax for conditional statements.

3. **DeepProbLog Features**: DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The code fails to meet requirements as it doesn't execute in ProbLog due to syntax incompatibility, despite having correct algorithm logic for standard Prolog.

2. **Edge Cases**: The implementation doesn't handle:
   - Non-list inputs
   - Empty lists (though the base case exists)
   - Lists with duplicate elements
   - Performance with large lists (deep recursion)

3. **ProbLog Specifics**: The code doesn't incorporate any probabilistic elements or neural network integration that ProbLog is designed for.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog doesn't support Prolog's `->/2` operator | Code cannot execute | Rewrite conditionals using ProbLog-compatible syntax |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | Doesn't utilize ProbLog's core features | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | May fail on non-list inputs | Add type checking predicates |
| 4 | No DeepProbLog integration | Limited to classical sorting | Consider adding neural network components if needed |

**Word count**: 398

The implementation needs significant modification to work in ProbLog, primarily replacing Prolog-specific syntax with ProbLog-compatible alternatives. The core sorting algorithm appears logically correct but cannot be verified until the syntax issues are resolved.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
