# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling robot navigation and key manipulation scenarios. The code implements probabilistic rules for robot movement, key pickup/drop actions, and slippery key behavior. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query probabilities:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities are consistent with the defined rules and show proper probabilistic computation.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All expansion predicates are correctly defined:
1. The `at/3` predicates for robot movement (hash 87A71821) correctly handle all three movement cases
2. The `at/3` predicates for key position (hash 75160384) properly model key carrying behavior
3. All probabilistic facts and rules follow proper probability computation

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct behavior in both classical and probabilistic aspects:

1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - Recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) have proper base cases and termination
   - Negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used correctly in all cases
   - All action scenarios are properly covered

2. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - Probability sums for alternatives are always 1.0 (e.g., 0.7::pickup_succeeds/0.3::pickup_fails)
   - Negation probabilities follow P(¬A)=1−P(A) correctly
   - Joint probabilities are computed properly through chaining

3. **DeepProbLog**: DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**:
   - Correctly models robot movement and key manipulation
   - Handles all edge cases (failed actions, stationary states)

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
   - Accurately computes probabilities for all scenarios
   - Properly handles probabilistic alternatives and dependencies

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Stationary cases are handled when no actions occur
   - Failed actions properly maintain previous states
   - Recursive depth is managed within reasonable bounds

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete for the specified requirements. All test cases pass with expected probabilities, demonstrating proper logical and probabilistic behavior. No errors or improvements were identified in the current implementation.
