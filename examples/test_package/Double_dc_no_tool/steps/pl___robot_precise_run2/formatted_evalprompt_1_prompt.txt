<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling robot navigation and key manipulation scenarios. The code implements probabilistic rules for robot movement, key pickup/drop actions, and slippery key behavior. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query probabilities:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities are consistent with the defined rules and show proper probabilistic computation.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All expansion predicates are correctly defined:
1. The `at/3` predicates for robot movement (hash 87A71821) correctly handle all three movement cases
2. The `at/3` predicates for key position (hash 75160384) properly model key carrying behavior
3. All probabilistic facts and rules follow proper probability computation

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct behavior in both classical and probabilistic aspects:

1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - Recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) have proper base cases and termination
   - Negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used correctly in all cases
   - All action scenarios are properly covered

2. **Probabilistic Rules**:
   - Probability sums for alternatives are always 1.0 (e.g., 0.7::pickup_succeeds/0.3::pickup_fails)
   - Negation probabilities follow P(¬A)=1−P(A) correctly
   - Joint probabilities are computed properly through chaining

3. **DeepProbLog**: DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**:
   - Correctly models robot movement and key manipulation
   - Handles all edge cases (failed actions, stationary states)

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
   - Accurately computes probabilities for all scenarios
   - Properly handles probabilistic alternatives and dependencies

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Stationary cases are handled when no actions occur
   - Failed actions properly maintain previous states
   - Recursive depth is managed within reasonable bounds

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete for the specified requirements. All test cases pass with expected probabilities, demonstrating proper logical and probabilistic behavior. No errors or improvements were identified in the current implementation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
