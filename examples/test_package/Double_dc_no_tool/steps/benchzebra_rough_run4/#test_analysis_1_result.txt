# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and ensure all constraints are properly satisfied.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with a single query:
```prolog
query(zebra(Houses)).
```

**Result:**
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle, as evidenced by the complete and consistent house arrangement returned with probability 1.0.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The main `zebra/1` predicate correctly encodes all puzzle constraints
   - Recursive predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`) properly terminate
   - All spatial relationships (right_of, next_to) are correctly implemented

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The solution uses classical Prolog without probabilistic elements
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are present in the implementation
   - DeepProbLog features are not used in this solution

3. **Constraint Satisfaction:**
   - Each constraint is verified in the solution:
     - Nationalities, colors, drinks, pets, and cigarettes all match the requirements
     - Spatial relationships (ivory right of green, Norwegian next to blue) are correct

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met:**
   - Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (classical Prolog only)
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - List handling: All predicates properly handle list boundaries
   - Recursion depth: Fixed at 5 houses, so no performance issues
   - Input validation: Not needed as the puzzle is self-contained

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - Could add argument validation for house structures
   - Might benefit from labeling for better performance in larger instances
