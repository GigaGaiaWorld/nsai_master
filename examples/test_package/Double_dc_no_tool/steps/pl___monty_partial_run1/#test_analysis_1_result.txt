# Monty Hall Problem ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, which demonstrates probability concepts through a game show scenario. The code models door selection, prize placement, and host behavior rules to calculate winning probabilities for both "keep" and "switch" strategies.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Equal initial probability distribution for prizes (1/3 each)
2. Fixed selection of door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the original choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates function as intended:
- `prize/1` correctly initializes uniform distribution (lines 1-2)
- `select_door/1` properly fixes selection (line 3)
- `open_door/1` rules correctly implement host behavior (lines 5-15)
- Winning conditions accurately reflect game logic (lines 17-23)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly handles probabilistic reasoning:
1. Prize distribution satisfies probability axioms (sum to 1)
2. Host behavior rules properly account for:
   - Random selection when both remaining doors are empty (P=0.5)
   - Deterministic selection when one door has prize (P=1)
3. Negation and implication are correctly implemented through:
   - `\+ prize(A)` for door emptiness checks
   - Conditional probabilities in `open_door` rules

Classical logic aspects are sound:
- `member/2` recursion terminates properly on finite lists
- All rules are mutually exclusive and exhaustive

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models game rules and constraints
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes probabilities for all scenarios
3. **Edge cases**: Properly handles all door configurations (prize locations)

Potential improvements:
1. Make door count parameterizable
2. Add validation for input constraints
3. Consider explicit modeling of door numbers as constants

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |

| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probability calculations for both strategies, demonstrating proper use of ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning capabilities.
