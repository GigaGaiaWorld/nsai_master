# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Zebra Puzzle (Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given constraints about nationalities, colors, drinks, cigarettes, and pets. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness and completeness of the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows one successful query execution:
```
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,water,kools,fox), 
       house(ukrainian,blue,tea,chesterfields,horse), 
       house(english,red,milk,winstons,snail), 
       house(spanish,ivory,orange_juice,lucky_strikes,dog), 
       house(japanese,green,coffee,parliaments,zebra)]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates function as intended:
- `houses/1` correctly initializes the 5-house structure
- `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` properly handle positional relationships
- `my_member/2` successfully checks for element membership

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical Prolog reasoning:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All puzzle constraints are properly encoded as predicates
2. **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) have proper base cases
3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: The solution meets all requirements:
   - House positions (Norwegian in first house, milk in middle)
   - Color relationships (green right of ivory)
   - Adjacency constraints (Kools next to horse)
   - Property assignments (English in red house)

Probabilistic aspects:
- The solution uses classical ProbLog (probability 1.0000)
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used
- No DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are utilized

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements for classical reasoning:
1. Correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints
2. Handles all positional relationships accurately
3. Properly assigns properties to houses

Edge cases considered:
- House initialization ensures exactly 5 houses
- Positional predicates handle all edge cases (first/last houses)
- All constraints are mutually satisfiable

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation is correct and complete for the given problem. For extension purposes, one might consider:
1. Adding probabilistic versions of constraints
2. Incorporating DeepProbLog for learning constraints
3. Adding validation checks for input formats
