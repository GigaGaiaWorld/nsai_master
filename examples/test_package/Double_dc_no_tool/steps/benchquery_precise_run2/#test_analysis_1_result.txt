# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided population and area data, then finds country pairs where densities differ by less than 5% using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.

## Test Results Summary
All test cases passed successfully:
1. `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`
2. `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`
3. `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`
4. `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly identifies country pairs with similar population densities using the specified 5% margin approximation.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented according to the requirements.

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct behavior in classical ProbLog scenarios:
1. **Logical Correctness**: 
   - The `density/2` predicate (lines 3A3D0149) correctly computes integer density using floor division
   - The `query_pop/1` predicate (lines DE4779C6) properly implements the 5% similarity check via integer inequalities

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - The program uses deterministic facts (population and area data)
   - All query results show probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic outcomes
   - No probabilistic facts or rules requiring P(¬A)=1−P(A) calculations are present

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network calls or tensor operations)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the functional requirements:
- **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly implements the population density comparison logic
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not extensively used (only deterministic facts)
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable in this case

**Edge Case Considerations**:
1. The floor division in `density/2` handles integer arithmetic correctly
2. The `C1 @< C2` condition prevents duplicate country pairs
3. All country pairs in the database are properly defined with no missing data
4. The 5% margin approximation using integer multiplication avoids floating-point issues
