</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Merge Sort in Prolog: Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The code recursively splits a list, sorts the sublists, and merges them back together. Our analysis verifies functional correctness, recursive termination, and edge case handling in classical Prolog contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
**Result:**
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorted the input list with full probabilistic certainty (1.0000).

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation meets all requirements:
1. Proper length checking and recursive boundary handling (lines 3-5)
2. Correct list splitting (lines 15-18)
3. Accurate merging of sorted sublists (lines 19-26)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- Logical correctness verified through successful sorting
- Recursive termination guaranteed by:
  - Base cases for empty/single-element lists (lines 1-2)
  - Proper list length reduction in recursive calls (lines 6-9)

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this implementation
- The 1.0000 probability indicates deterministic behavior
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented merge sort algorithm
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure classical implementation)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. Empty list: Handled by base case (line 1)
2. Single-element list: Handled by base case (line 2)
3. Odd-length lists: Correctly handled by integer division in split_list
4. Non-list input: Would fail gracefully due to length/2 predicate
5. Deep recursion: No stack overflow protection for very large lists

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Consider adding input validation for non-list types |
| 2 | None | None | Could optimize for already-sorted lists |
| 3 | None | None | Add tail recursion optimization for large lists |

**Code Quality Notes:**
```prolog
% Well-structured implementation with clear separation of concerns:
% 1. Base cases (lines 1-2)
% 2. Recursive division (lines 3-9)
% 3. Merging logic (lines 19-26)
```

The implementation demonstrates solid Prolog programming practices with proper recursive decomposition and clear predicate responsibilities. For production use, additional performance optimizations and input validation would be recommended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
