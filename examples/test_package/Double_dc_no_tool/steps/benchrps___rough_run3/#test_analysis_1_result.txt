# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on the correctness of game rules implementation, result calculation, and score determination. The analysis verifies classical logical reasoning aspects without probabilistic elements or neural network integration.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Returned the expected result:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The implementation correctly:
1. Identifies individual round outcomes (win/lose/draw)
2. Calculates the aggregate score
3. Determines the final winner based on score

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following predicates were verified:
- `move/1` (lines 3-5): Correctly defines valid moves
- `beats/2` (lines 7-9): Correctly implements game rules
- `play_round/3` (lines 13-15): Correctly determines round outcomes
- `play/3` (lines 17-20): Correctly processes move lists
- `compute_score/2` (lines 22-25): Correctly calculates aggregate score
- `determine_winner/3` (lines 26-31): Correctly identifies final winner

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical Prolog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All predicates correctly implement the game's logical rules with proper head-tail recursion for list processing
2. **Termination**: All recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) have proper base cases and terminate correctly
3. **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles:
   - Empty move lists (base cases)
   - Tied rounds (draw outcomes)
   - All possible move combinations

Probabilistic aspects were not used in this implementation. The report confirms:
- No probabilistic facts or rules were defined
- No DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) were used

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required/implemented
- Neural network integration: Not required/implemented

**Edge Case Considerations**:
1. **Input Validation**: The code assumes proper move inputs (rock/paper/scissor)
2. **List Handling**: Properly processes empty lists and unequal length lists (though unequal lengths would cause failure)
3. **Performance**: Recursion depth equals move list length - acceptable for typical game lengths

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly follows rock-paper-scissors rules and produces accurate results for all test cases. For production use, consider adding input validation for move lists and handling unequal length lists gracefully.
