    raise UnmatchedCharacter(string, token.location)
problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character ')' at 8:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Problog Bubblesort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm in ProbLog context. The code provides a recursive bubblesort implementation with accumulator pattern, intended to sort lists of integers. The evaluation focuses on syntax correctness, logical validity, and ProbLog compatibility.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with a syntax error:
```
Unmatched character ')' at 8:5
```
No queries were successfully executed due to this parsing error. The test intended to verify sorting of the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` was not completed.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the parser before any predicate evaluation, indicating a syntax issue. The problematic location is at line 8, column 5 in the input file. The code structure shows mismatched parentheses or incorrect operator usage that prevents proper parsing.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Error**: The parser encountered an unexpected closing parenthesis. This suggests either:
   - Missing opening parenthesis
   - Incorrect operator placement
   - Malformed query structure

2. **Logical Structure**: While the bubblesort implementation appears logically correct for standard Prolog, the ProbLog parser has stricter syntax requirements. The conditional operator `->` may need special handling in ProbLog context.

3. **ProbLog Compatibility**: The code doesn't contain any probabilistic facts or rules, nor does it use DeepProbLog features. The evaluation is purely syntactic at this stage.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Compliance**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not testable due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not implemented
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input handling not verified
   - Empty list case appears correct in code
   - Deep recursion performance not testable

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Proper accumulator pattern implementation
   - Missing ProbLog-specific declarations
   - Syntax incompatible with ProbLog parser

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error - unmatched parenthesis | Prevents execution | Review and correct parenthesis balance |
| 2 | ProbLog parser incompatibility | Code cannot be evaluated | Rewrite using basic ProbLog syntax or add proper declarations |
| 3 | Missing probabilistic elements | Limited to classical Prolog | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed |
| 4 | No DeepProbLog usage | No neural integration | Consider adding nn/3 predicates if needed |

```prolog
% Corrected version suggestion
bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort([X], Acc, [X|Acc]).
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    (X > Y ->
        bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted)
    ;
        bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted)
    ).

forth_sort(L, L2) :- bubblesort(L, [], L2).

% ProbLog-compatible query
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```

The main issue appears to be a syntax parsing conflict between standard Prolog and ProbLog's extended syntax requirements. The algorithm itself is correctly implemented for classical Prolog but needs adaptation for ProbLog environment.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
