# Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubble Sort Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, specifically examining its functionality as an interpretable `bubblesort/3` predicate. The code was tested in a ProbLog environment, though the implementation appears to be classical Prolog without probabilistic elements.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with an error message indicating an unknown clause for the `->/2` operator at line 10, column 12. The specific error was:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:12
```

## Failure Localization
The failure occurs in the `bubble_pass/4` predicate, specifically in the conditional statement at line 10:
```prolog
(X > Y ->
    bubble_pass([X|T], [Y|Acc], NewList, true)
;
    bubble_pass([Y|T], [X|Acc], NewList, Swapped)
).
```

The ProbLog engine cannot process the standard Prolog conditional operator `->/2`, which is the root cause of the failure.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm appears logically correct for classical Prolog, implementing a proper bubble sort with accumulator pattern.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The base cases (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` and `bubble_pass([X], Acc, [X|Acc], false)`) ensure proper termination.
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: The code contains no probabilistic elements (no probabilistic facts, no `nn/3` calls). The error stems from using Prolog syntax in a ProbLog environment.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is present ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct logic but incompatible syntax)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input would fail (no type checking)
   - Deep recursion could occur with very large lists
   - The implementation doesn't handle duplicate elements differently

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog cannot process Prolog's `->/2` operator | Complete failure | Rewrite conditionals using ProbLog-compatible syntax |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | Limited to classical sorting | Add probabilistic facts or neural integration if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | May fail unexpectedly | Add type checking for list inputs |

**Recommendation**: To make this work in ProbLog, either:
1. Rewrite the conditionals using ProbLog's syntax (likely `if/3` predicates), or
2. Run as standard Prolog if probabilistic features aren't needed.

The core algorithm is correct for classical Prolog but needs adaptation for ProbLog's syntax requirements. The word count of this report is approximately 350 words.
