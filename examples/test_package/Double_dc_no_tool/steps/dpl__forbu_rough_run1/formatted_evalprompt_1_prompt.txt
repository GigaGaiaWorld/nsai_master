    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubble Sort Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, specifically examining its functionality as an interpretable `bubblesort/3` predicate. The code was tested in a ProbLog environment, though the implementation appears to be classical Prolog without probabilistic elements.

## Test Results Summary
The test failed with an error message indicating an unknown clause for the `->/2` operator at line 10, column 12. The specific error was:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 10:12
```

## Failure Localization
The failure occurs in the `bubble_pass/4` predicate, specifically in the conditional statement at line 10:
```prolog
(X > Y ->
    bubble_pass([X|T], [Y|Acc], NewList, true)
;
    bubble_pass([Y|T], [X|Acc], NewList, Swapped)
).
```

The ProbLog engine cannot process the standard Prolog conditional operator `->/2`, which is the root cause of the failure.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm appears logically correct for classical Prolog, implementing a proper bubble sort with accumulator pattern.
2. **Recursive Termination**: The base cases (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` and `bubble_pass([X], Acc, [X|Acc], false)`) ensure proper termination.
3. **Probabilistic Compliance**: The code contains no probabilistic elements (no probabilistic facts, no `nn/3` calls). The error stems from using Prolog syntax in a ProbLog environment.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is present ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct logic but incompatible syntax)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list input would fail (no type checking)
   - Deep recursion could occur with very large lists
   - The implementation doesn't handle duplicate elements differently

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog cannot process Prolog's `->/2` operator | Complete failure | Rewrite conditionals using ProbLog-compatible syntax |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements implemented | Limited to classical sorting | Add probabilistic facts or neural integration if needed |
| 3 | No input validation | May fail unexpectedly | Add type checking for list inputs |

**Recommendation**: To make this work in ProbLog, either:
1. Rewrite the conditionals using ProbLog's syntax (likely `if/3` predicates), or
2. Run as standard Prolog if probabilistic features aren't needed.

The core algorithm is correct for classical Prolog but needs adaptation for ProbLog's syntax requirements. The word count of this report is approximately 350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
