# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that models coin tossing with a biased coin (p=0.8 for heads). The program recursively counts the number of heads (S) when tossing CNT independent coins, specifically testing with CNT=4. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, probabilistic computation, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for total heads when tossing 4 coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```
All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly match the expected binomial distribution for n=4 trials with p=0.8.

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the test results. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Recursive counting of coin tosses (lines 3-14)
2. Probabilistic fact declaration (line 2)
3. Base case termination (line 3)
4. Both success and failure branches of coin tosses (lines 6-9 and 10-13)

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. **Probability Calculation**: For each coin, P(heads)=0.8 and P(tails)=0.2
2. **Binomial Distribution**: The results follow P(k) = C(4,k)*(0.8)^k*(0.2)^(4-k)
3. **Negation Handling**: `\+ coin(CNT)` correctly represents the 20% tail probability
4. **Recursive Logic**: The accumulator (SC) properly counts heads through all recursion levels

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The program fully meets its functional requirements:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Correct recursive counting logic
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Accurate probability calculations
3. **Edge Cases**: Handles CNT=0 termination and maintains probability through recursion

Potential improvements:
1. Make the coin count (currently hardcoded as 4) parameterizable
2. Add input validation for CNT (should be non-negative integer)
