# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, analyzing its logical correctness, test results, and compliance with probabilistic reasoning principles. The code defines game rules, result calculation, and score computation to determine the winner between two players.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 as the winner (2 losses vs 1 win for player1), demonstrating proper implementation of game rules and scoring.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- Basic move definitions (rock, paper, scissor)
- Win-lose relationships (beats/2 predicates)
- Result calculation for each round
- Score computation and winner determination

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:** The rules properly implement rock-paper-scissors logic with correct termination conditions for recursion in play/3 and compute_score/2.
2. **Recursive Termination:** Base cases are properly defined for empty lists in both play/3 and compute_score/2.

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
1. The implementation uses deterministic facts (no probabilistic facts), so probabilistic rules don't apply here.
2. DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration).

**Edge Cases Verified:**
1. Empty input lists (handled by base cases)
2. Draw situations (correctly scored as 0)
3. All possible move combinations (rock-paper, paper-scissor, scissor-rock)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully implemented with correct game rules and result calculation
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (deterministic implementation)
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. Non-list inputs would fail (no type checking)
2. Uneven move lists would cause failure (no length validation)
3. Performance is good for reasonable list lengths due to linear recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type/length checks |
| 2 | No probabilistic facts | Limits probabilistic reasoning | Consider adding move probabilities |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog usage | No neural integration | Could add NN-based move prediction |

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation correctly handles the basic rock-paper-scissors game logic with proper recursive termination and scoring. While functionally correct for deterministic play, it could be enhanced with input validation and probabilistic extensions for more advanced scenarios.
