# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on move definitions, win/lose relationships, game result calculation, and score computation. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 as the winner since they won 2 out of 3 rounds (rock vs paper loses twice, rock vs scissor wins once), resulting in a net score of -1.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates are correctly defined:
- Move definitions (rock, paper, scissor)
- Win/lose relationships (beats/2)
- Game result calculation (result/3)
- Score computation (compute_score/2)
- Winner determination (determine_winner/3)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical Problog logic:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All rules properly define the game mechanics
2. **Recursive Termination**: Both `play/3` and `compute_score/2` have proper base cases
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts are used (pure logical program)
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

The score computation correctly handles:
- Win (+1)
- Lose (-1)
- Draw (0)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully met (game logic correctly implemented)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty move lists handled by base cases
2. All possible move combinations covered
3. Score calculation handles all result types (win/lose/draw)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for move lists
2. Consider adding probabilistic move selection
3. Add tie-breaking rules for extended games

## Error Summary

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

The implementation correctly models the rock-paper-scissors game with proper handling of all game scenarios. No errors were found during evaluation.
