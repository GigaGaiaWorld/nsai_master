# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition. The error message indicates "No clauses found for ''->'/2'" at line 6, character 126. No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-8). The problematic implementation attempts to use an if-then-else construct with incorrect syntax:
```prolog
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected), 
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors), 
    (   Doors = [A,B] -> 0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) ; 
        Doors = [A] -> open_door(A) 
    ).
```

Key issues:
1. Incorrect use of probabilistic facts in the body of a rule (0.5::open_door(A))
2. Improper if-then-else structure with multiple conditions
3. Missing cases in the conditional logic

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation violates several ProbLog principles:
1. **Syntax Error**: The if-then-else construct is malformed, mixing probabilistic facts with deterministic rules
2. **Probabilistic Logic**: Cannot use probabilistic facts (::) in rule bodies - they should only appear as facts
3. **Logical Completeness**: The implementation doesn't properly handle all possible door configurations

For probabilistic correctness, we should ensure:
- `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is maintained
- All possible outcomes are properly enumerated
- Probabilistic facts are properly defined at the top level

## Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet functional requirements:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Partially implemented but incomplete
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Incorrect implementation of probability distributions
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases not handled:
- Multiple doors with prizes (invalid in Monty Hall)
- No valid doors to open
- Non-integer door identifiers

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in if-then-else | Code won't compile | Rewrite conditional logic using proper Prolog syntax |
| 2 | Probabilistic facts in rule body | Invalid ProbLog syntax | Define probabilistic choices separately |
| 3 | Incomplete door handling | Logical incompleteness | Add case for when selected door has prize |
| 4 | Missing base cases | Possible infinite recursion | Ensure all paths terminate |

## Corrected Implementation Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(A) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors),
    member(A, Doors),
    uniform(Doors, A).

uniform([X], X).
uniform([X,Y], X) :- 0.5::; uniform([X,Y], Y).
```

This separates the probabilistic choice from the deterministic logic and properly handles all cases while maintaining correct probability distributions.
