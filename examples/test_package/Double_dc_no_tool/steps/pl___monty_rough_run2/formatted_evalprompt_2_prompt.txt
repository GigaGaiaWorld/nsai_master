</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog: Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host (Monty) opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by either keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical syntax error. The error message indicates an unknown clause for an operator at line 6, position 137. No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation failure.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate definition (lines 6-137). The parser encounters an unexpected operator sequence `''->'/2'`, suggesting malformed syntax in the conditional probability definition.

Key problematic elements:
1. The probability annotation `0.5::open_door(D)` appears inside a rule body, which is invalid syntax
2. The conditional structure using `->` doesn't properly handle the probabilistic cases

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation violates several ProbLog syntax rules:

1. **Probabilistic Fact Placement**: Probability annotations must be at the head of clauses, not embedded in rule bodies
2. **Conditional Structure**: The `->` operator isn't properly handling the probabilistic cases
3. **List Handling**: While the `member/2` predicate is correctly defined, its usage in the probabilistic context is problematic

The correct probabilistic interpretation would require:
- Defining separate probabilistic facts for each possible door opening scenario
- Properly handling the conditional probabilities P(open_door(D)|conditions)

## Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet its functional requirements due to syntax errors. Key issues:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: The basic logical structure is sound but unimplementable due to syntax errors
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The probability handling is incorrectly implemented
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases not properly handled:
- Invalid door numbers
- Multiple prize locations
- Non-uniform probability distributions

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid probability annotation in rule body | Code won't compile | Move probability annotations to clause heads |
| 2 | Malformed conditional structure | Logical flow broken | Restructure using separate probabilistic clauses |
| 3 | Missing base cases | Potential infinite recursion | Add explicit base cases for all predicates |

```prolog
% Suggested corrected structure
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors),
    length(Doors, Len),
    (Len = 2 -> random_member(D, Doors) ; Len = 1 -> [D] = Doors).

0.5::open_door_a(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), [A,B]),
    member(D, [A,B]).
```

The corrected implementation should separate the probabilistic choices from the logical conditions and properly handle all possible door-opening scenarios according to the Monty Hall problem specifications.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
