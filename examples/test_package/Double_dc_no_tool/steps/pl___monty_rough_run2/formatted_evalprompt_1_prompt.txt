</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, which simulates a game show scenario where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host (Monty) then opens a door that neither contains the prize nor was selected by the player. The implementation aims to model both the "keep" strategy (staying with the initial choice) and the "switch" strategy (changing doors after one is revealed).

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition. The error message indicates an unknown clause for an operator at position 6:150, suggesting malformed syntax in the probabilistic rule definition.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Component**: `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-150)
2. **Error Type**: Syntax error in probabilistic rule definition
3. **Specific Issue**: The implementation attempts to use a conditional probability (0.5::open_door(Door)) within a rule body, which is not valid ProbLog syntax

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**:
   - The prize distribution and door selection are correctly modeled with probabilistic facts
   - The `member/2` helper predicate is correctly defined
   - The win conditions (`win_keep` and `win_switch`) are logically sound

2. **Probabilistic Issues**:
   - Invalid mixing of deterministic and probabilistic reasoning in `open_door/1`
   - The attempt to use `0.5::open_door(Door)` within a rule body violates ProbLog's syntax rules
   - Probabilistic choices must be defined as facts, not within rule bodies

3. **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (except for `open_door/1`)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Partially met (prize distribution correct)
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The implementation doesn't handle cases where the player's initial selection might contain the prize
   - No validation for door selection values
   - The probabilistic rule syntax is incorrect

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid probabilistic rule syntax in `open_door/1` | Code cannot execute | Restructure to separate probabilistic choices from deterministic rules |
| 2 | Mixing deterministic and probabilistic reasoning | Logical inconsistency | Define probabilistic choices as separate facts |
| 3 | No handling of edge cases in door selection | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |

## Corrected Implementation Suggestion
```prolog
% Correct approach for open_door/1
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), [A,B]),
    random_select(D, [A,B], _).

open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), [D]).
```

The corrected version separates the probabilistic choice (random selection between two doors) from the deterministic case (only one door available to open). This maintains the logical requirements while using valid ProbLog syntax.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
