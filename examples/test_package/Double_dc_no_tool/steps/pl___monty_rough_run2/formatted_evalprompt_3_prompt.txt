problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:126.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition. The error message indicates "No clauses found for ''->'/2'" at line 6, character 126. No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-8). The problematic implementation attempts to use an if-then-else construct with incorrect syntax:
```prolog
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected), 
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors), 
    (   Doors = [A,B] -> 0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) ; 
        Doors = [A] -> open_door(A) 
    ).
```

Key issues:
1. Incorrect use of probabilistic facts in the body of a rule (0.5::open_door(A))
2. Improper if-then-else structure with multiple conditions
3. Missing cases in the conditional logic

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation violates several ProbLog principles:
1. **Syntax Error**: The if-then-else construct is malformed, mixing probabilistic facts with deterministic rules
2. **Probabilistic Logic**: Cannot use probabilistic facts (::) in rule bodies - they should only appear as facts
3. **Logical Completeness**: The implementation doesn't properly handle all possible door configurations

For probabilistic correctness, we should ensure:
- `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is maintained
- All possible outcomes are properly enumerated
- Probabilistic facts are properly defined at the top level

## Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet functional requirements:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Partially implemented but incomplete
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Incorrect implementation of probability distributions
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases not handled:
- Multiple doors with prizes (invalid in Monty Hall)
- No valid doors to open
- Non-integer door identifiers

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Syntax error in if-then-else | Code won't compile | Rewrite conditional logic using proper Prolog syntax |
| 2 | Probabilistic facts in rule body | Invalid ProbLog syntax | Define probabilistic choices separately |
| 3 | Incomplete door handling | Logical incompleteness | Add case for when selected door has prize |
| 4 | Missing base cases | Possible infinite recursion | Ensure all paths terminate |

## Corrected Implementation Suggestion
```prolog
open_door(A) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors),
    member(A, Doors),
    uniform(Doors, A).

uniform([X], X).
uniform([X,Y], X) :- 0.5::; uniform([X,Y], Y).
```

This separates the probabilistic choice from the deterministic logic and properly handles all cases while maintaining correct probability distributions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
