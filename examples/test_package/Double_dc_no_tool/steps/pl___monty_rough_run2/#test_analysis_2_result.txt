# Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog: Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code aims to model the scenario where a player selects a door, the host (Monty) opens another door revealing no prize, and calculates probabilities for winning by either keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a critical syntax error. The error message indicates an unknown clause for an operator at line 6, position 137. No queries could be successfully executed due to this compilation failure.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `open_door/1` predicate definition (lines 6-137). The parser encounters an unexpected operator sequence `''->'/2'`, suggesting malformed syntax in the conditional probability definition.

Key problematic elements:
1. The probability annotation `0.5::open_door(D)` appears inside a rule body, which is invalid syntax
2. The conditional structure using `->` doesn't properly handle the probabilistic cases

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation violates several ProbLog syntax rules:

1. **Probabilistic Fact Placement**: Probability annotations must be at the head of clauses, not embedded in rule bodies
2. **Conditional Structure**: The `->` operator isn't properly handling the probabilistic cases
3. **List Handling**: While the `member/2` predicate is correctly defined, its usage in the probabilistic context is problematic

The correct probabilistic interpretation would require:
- Defining separate probabilistic facts for each possible door opening scenario
- Properly handling the conditional probabilities P(open_door(D)|conditions)

## Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet its functional requirements due to syntax errors. Key issues:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: The basic logical structure is sound but unimplementable due to syntax errors
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The probability handling is incorrectly implemented
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases not properly handled:
- Invalid door numbers
- Multiple prize locations
- Non-uniform probability distributions

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid probability annotation in rule body | Code won't compile | Move probability annotations to clause heads |
| 2 | Malformed conditional structure | Logical flow broken | Restructure using separate probabilistic clauses |
| 3 | Missing base cases | Potential infinite recursion | Add explicit base cases for all predicates |

```prolog
% Suggested corrected structure
open_door(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), Doors),
    length(Doors, Len),
    (Len = 2 -> random_member(D, Doors) ; Len = 1 -> [D] = Doors).

0.5::open_door_a(D) :- 
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), X \= Selected, \+ prize(X)), [A,B]),
    member(D, [A,B]).
```

The corrected implementation should separate the probabilistic choices from the logical conditions and properly handle all possible door-opening scenarios according to the Monty Hall problem specifications.
