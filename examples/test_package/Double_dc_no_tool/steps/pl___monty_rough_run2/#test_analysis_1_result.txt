# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, which simulates a game show scenario where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host (Monty) then opens a door that neither contains the prize nor was selected by the player. The implementation aims to model both the "keep" strategy (staying with the initial choice) and the "switch" strategy (changing doors after one is revealed).

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error in the `open_door/1` predicate definition. The error message indicates an unknown clause for an operator at position 6:150, suggesting malformed syntax in the probabilistic rule definition.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Component**: `open_door/1` predicate (lines 6-150)
2. **Error Type**: Syntax error in probabilistic rule definition
3. **Specific Issue**: The implementation attempts to use a conditional probability (0.5::open_door(Door)) within a rule body, which is not valid ProbLog syntax

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**:
   - The prize distribution and door selection are correctly modeled with probabilistic facts
   - The `member/2` helper predicate is correctly defined
   - The win conditions (`win_keep` and `win_switch`) are logically sound

2. **Probabilistic Issues**:
   - Invalid mixing of deterministic and probabilistic reasoning in `open_door/1`
   - The attempt to use `0.5::open_door(Door)` within a rule body violates ProbLog's syntax rules
   - Probabilistic choices must be defined as facts, not within rule bodies

3. **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this implementation

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (except for `open_door/1`)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Partially met (prize distribution correct)
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The implementation doesn't handle cases where the player's initial selection might contain the prize
   - No validation for door selection values
   - The probabilistic rule syntax is incorrect

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid probabilistic rule syntax in `open_door/1` | Code cannot execute | Restructure to separate probabilistic choices from deterministic rules |
| 2 | Mixing deterministic and probabilistic reasoning | Logical inconsistency | Define probabilistic choices as separate facts |
| 3 | No handling of edge cases in door selection | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |

## Corrected Implementation Suggestion
```prolog
% Correct approach for open_door/1
open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), [A,B]),
    random_select(D, [A,B], _).

open_door(D) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    findall(X, (member(X,[1,2,3]), \+ prize(X), X \= Selected), [D]).
```

The corrected version separates the probabilistic choice (random selection between two doors) from the deterministic case (only one door available to open). This maintains the logical requirements while using valid ProbLog syntax.
