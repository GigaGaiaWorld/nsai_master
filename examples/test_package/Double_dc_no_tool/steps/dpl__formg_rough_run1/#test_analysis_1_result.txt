# Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against functional requirements and identify potential edge cases or logical errors.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
Result:
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. Element comparison and ordering

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical Prolog terms:
1. **Recursive termination**: Properly handles base cases (lines 1-2) and ensures recursive calls (lines 4-8) reduce problem size
2. **Splitting**: The `split/3` predicate (lines 9-12) correctly divides lists into equal halves
3. **Merging**: The `merge/3` predicate (lines 13-19) properly handles all comparison cases

Probabilistic aspects:
- The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- **DeepProbLog feature not used**

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure deterministic implementation)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge case considerations:**
1. Non-list input would fail (no type checking)
2. Very large lists might cause stack overflow due to deep recursion
3. The implementation assumes all elements are comparable with `=<` and `>`

**Potential improvements:**
1. Add input validation
2. Consider tail recursion optimization
3. Add support for custom comparison predicates

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May fail on non-list inputs | Add type checking |
| 2 | Deep recursion risk | Potential stack overflow for large lists | Implement iterative version or tail recursion |
| 3 | Fixed comparison operators | Limits sorting to numerical types | Add customizable comparison predicate |

The implementation is correct for its specified purpose but could be made more robust with additional validation and flexibility features. The merge sort algorithm itself is properly implemented with correct divide-and-conquer logic and proper base cases.
