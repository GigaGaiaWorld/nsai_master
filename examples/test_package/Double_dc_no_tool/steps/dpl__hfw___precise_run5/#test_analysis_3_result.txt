# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, converts them to symbols, then parses the expression using recursive rules with floating-point precision checking.

## Test Results Summary
The test case `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` failed with a CallModeError. The error occurs when comparing floating-point results using `almost_equal/2` with non-ground arguments.

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Query**: `expression([image_2,...], X)`
   - Error occurs in `almost_equal/2` when processing the multiplication operation
   - Line 24 (in the parse rule for division)
   - Actual error: `CallModeError` for `</2` with non-ground arguments
   - Expected: Successful evaluation of the expression 2/(3+3)-2*7 â‰ˆ -13.666...

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Issue**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate attempts to compare non-ground variables during arithmetic evaluation, violating ProbLog's requirement for ground arguments in numerical comparisons.
2. **Recursive Structure**: The parsing recursion is correctly structured but fails at the comparison step.
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or neural network integrations are used in this implementation (DeepProbLog feature not used).

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical parsing logic is partially implemented but fails at evaluation
   - No probabilistic reasoning requirements were specified
   - No neural network integration despite image input declarations

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs are not handled
   - Division by zero protection missing
   - Floating-point comparison needs ground terms
   - No error handling for invalid symbol sequences

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground comparison in almost_equal/2 | Prevents expression evaluation | Restructure to ensure ground terms before comparison |
| 2 | Missing input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking for input lists |
| 3 | No division by zero check | Potential runtime error | Add guard condition for division |
| 4 | No probabilistic elements used | Limited to classical Prolog | Consider adding uncertainty handling |

```prolog
% Suggested fix for almost_equal/2
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), ground(Y), 
    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(Y), 
    ground(X), 
    Y is float(X).
```

The main issue stems from attempting to compare uninstantiated variables during arithmetic evaluation. The solution requires ensuring all compared terms are ground before numerical operations. The evaluation reveals a need for more robust input handling and error checking in the arithmetic operations.
