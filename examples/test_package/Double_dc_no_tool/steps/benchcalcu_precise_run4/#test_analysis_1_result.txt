# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must adhere to three key constraints: (1) multi-digit numbers cannot start with 0, (2) all letters represent unique digits, and (3) column-wise addition with proper carry handling.

## Test Results Summary
The program returned 10 valid solutions, all with probability 1.0000:
```
query_sum([4,7,8,2,9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4,7,8,3,0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5,6,7,2,8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5,7,8,4,1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6,7,8,5,2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7,4,5,2,6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7,5,6,3,8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8,3,4,2,5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8,4,5,3,7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8,5,6,4,9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies all constraints:
1. First digits (A,B,C) are non-zero (via `leftdigit/1`)
2. All digits are unique (via `all_different/1`)
3. Column addition with carry is correctly implemented (via `sumdigit/5`)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All expansion predicates (`digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and function as intended in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Root Cause Analysis
### Logical Correctness
- The program correctly implements the puzzle constraints through:
  - Base case and recursive case in `all_different/1` (lines 9-12)
  - Proper carry handling in `sumdigit/5` (lines 14-18)
  - Valid digit selection via `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1` (lines 3-7)

### Probabilistic Aspects
- Since this is a classical logic problem, all solutions have probability 1.0000 when found
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog features are not utilized (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully satisfied with correct constraint implementation
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (pure logical problem)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (DeepProbLog features absent)

### Edge Cases Considered
1. **First Digit Zero**: Prevented by `leftdigit/1` constraint
2. **Duplicate Digits**: Handled by `all_different/1`
3. **Carry Propagation**: Correctly managed through chained `sumdigit/5` calls
4. **Digit Range**: Enforced by `digit/1` facts
