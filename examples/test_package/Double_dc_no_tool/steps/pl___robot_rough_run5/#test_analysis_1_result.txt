# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's key pickup scenario with probabilistic outcomes. The code handles robot movement, key pickup attempts, and slippery key conditions with associated probabilities. The purpose is to verify correct probabilistic reasoning and logical flow.

## Test Results Summary
The program executed 2 queries with the following results:

1. `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` = 0.4331
2. `at(_,_,s(s(s(0))))` returned multiple positions:
   - at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
   - at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
   - at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
   - at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
   - at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
   - at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results show consistent probabilities that properly account for all possible execution paths and their probabilities.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- Key carrying rules (lines 1-10) correctly model pickup and retention
- Movement rules (lines 27-32) properly handle success/failure cases
- Slippery key logic (lines 12-25) accurately tracks key state changes

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic calculations are correct:
1. Pickup success (70%) and failure (30%) probabilities are properly applied
2. Slippery key probabilities (60% drop vs 40% hold) correctly factor into carrying probability
3. Movement success (90%) and failure (10%) probabilities properly affect location distributions
4. Negation probabilities follow P(¬A)=1−P(A) rule consistently

The recursive cases all have proper base cases and termination conditions. No infinite recursion paths exist.

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - The code contains no neural network integrations.

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets its functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models state transitions and preconditions
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes combined probabilities
3. **Edge cases**: Properly handles all temporal states and probabilistic branches

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. Multiple simultaneous actions (currently prevented by single-action timeline)
2. Very deep recursion (currently limited by fixed time steps)
3. Undefined positions (all positions are explicitly initialized)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The code demonstrates correct implementation of probabilistic logic programming principles with proper handling of all specified scenarios. The test results validate the expected behavior across all possible execution paths.
