# Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against functional requirements and identify potential edge cases or logical errors.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
Result:
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list with 100% probability, matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. Element comparison during merging

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The algorithm follows standard merge sort logic (split, recursive sort, merge)
   - All predicates (`merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, `merge/3`) are correctly defined
   - Recursion terminates properly via length checks

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty list: Handled by first clause
   - Single element: Handled by second clause
   - Odd-length lists: Correctly handled by integer division in `split/3`

### ProbLog Analysis
1. The test shows 1.0000 probability, indicating deterministic behavior
2. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
3. **DeepProbLog feature not used**

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met - correct sorting implementation
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used

### Edge Case Considerations
1. **Non-list input**: Not explicitly handled (would cause type errors)
2. **Performance**: Recursive depth is logarithmic to input size
3. **Duplicate elements**: Correctly handled by merge comparison (`=<` and `>`)
4. **Large lists**: No stack protection for very deep recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | Consider adding input validation |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Add protection against stack overflow |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Could extend for probabilistic sorting |

```prolog
% Correct implementation verified:
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).
```

The implementation is correct for classical Prolog merge sort requirements. For a complete ProbLog solution, probabilistic facts or rules would need to be incorporated. The current deterministic implementation passes all basic functionality tests.
