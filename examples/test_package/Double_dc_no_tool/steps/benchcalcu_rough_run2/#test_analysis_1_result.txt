# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must find unique digit assignments that satisfy the equation while adhering to arithmetic rules and digit constraints.

## Test Results Summary
The program returned 10 valid solutions, each with a probability of 1.0000:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures) because:
1. Each solution satisfies the equation AB + BCD = CDE
2. All digits are unique per `all_different/1`
3. Leading digits (A,B,C) are non-zero per `leftdigit/1`
4. Column additions are correct per `sumdigit/5`

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. All expansion predicates (`digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The program correctly models the puzzle constraints:
   ```prolog
   sumdigit(Cin, A, B, Sum, Cout) :- 
     X is Cin + A + B,
     ( X < 10, Sum = X, Cout = 0
     ; 
     X >= 10, Sum is X - 10, Cout = 1 ).
   ```
   This handles both non-carry and carry scenarios.

2. **Recursive Termination**: The `all_different/1` predicate terminates properly as it reduces the list size with each recursive call.

### ProbLog Analysis
The program uses deterministic facts (`digit/1`) and constraints, so probabilistic rules aren't directly applicable. The 1.0000 probabilities indicate certainty in the solutions.

### DeepProbLog
DeepProbLog features (neural networks, tensor operations) were not used in this solution.

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met - correctly solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used

### Edge Cases Considered
1. **Leading Zero Prevention**: Handled by `leftdigit/1`
2. **Digit Uniqueness**: Enforced by `all_different/1`
3. **Arithmetic Validation**: Column-wise addition verified by `sumdigit/5`
