# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models the scenario where a contestant selects a door (always door 1), the host opens another door according to specific rules, and we calculate the probabilities of winning by either keeping or switching the initial choice.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform probability distribution for the prize location (1/3 each)
2. Certainty of selecting door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates correctly implement the Monty Hall problem logic:
1. `open_door/1` rules correctly handle both cases (when two empty doors are available and when only one empty door is available)
2. `win_keep/0` and `win_switch/0` correctly calculate the winning probabilities
3. The probabilistic facts for `prize/1` are correctly defined with uniform distribution

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
1. The negation in `\+ prize(A)` correctly computes as `1-P(prize(A))`
2. The disjunction in prize distribution uses proper probabilistic semantics
3. The conditional probabilities in `open_door/1` rules correctly implement the host's behavior:
   - When two empty doors available: random selection (50/50)
   - When one empty door available: deterministic selection

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets the functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly implements the logical rules of the game
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes the probabilities
3. **Edge cases**: Handles all door selection scenarios correctly

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. Non-list inputs to `member/2` (though not applicable in this fixed scenario)
2. Adding more doors would require generalization of the current implementation

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | No errors detected | N/A | N/A |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with 300 words of analysis demonstrating its correctness in both logical structure and probabilistic computation. The clear separation of cases in the `open_door/1` rules and proper probability calculations result in the expected 1/3 vs 2/3 winning probabilities for keep/switch strategies.
