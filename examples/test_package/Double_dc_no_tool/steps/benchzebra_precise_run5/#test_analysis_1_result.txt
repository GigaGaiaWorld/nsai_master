# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires deducing the correct arrangement of 5 houses based on 15 given clues about nationalities, colors, drinks, cigarettes, and pets. The implementation should correctly model all constraints and find the unique solution where someone owns a zebra and someone drinks water.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs because:
1. The code uses `member/2` predicate (line 4) but this predicate is not defined in the program
2. While there is a `my_member/2` predicate defined later, it's not being used in the main constraints
3. Line number interval: The error originates from the first use of `member/2` in the zebra/1 predicate definition

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Analysis**:
   - The logical structure of the puzzle constraints is correct
   - The recursive predicates (right_of/3, next_to/3, my_member/2) are properly defined and should terminate
   - The error is purely syntactic - using an undefined predicate

2. **Probabilistic Analysis**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The program is purely deterministic classical logic
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct constraints but implementation error)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The houses/1 predicate correctly initializes the 5-house structure
   - The recursive predicates handle list boundaries correctly
   - Missing error handling for malformed input (though not required for this puzzle)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined member/2 predicate | Complete failure | Replace all member/2 calls with my_member/2 |
| 2 | No probabilistic elements used | N/A | Consider adding probabilistic constraints if needed |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog integration | N/A | Could enhance with neural network components |

**Recommendation**: The immediate fix is to replace all instances of `member/2` with `my_member/2` in the zebra/1 predicate. The logical structure appears correct otherwise, and this change should allow the puzzle to solve correctly.

```prolog
% Corrected version would use:
my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
my_member(house(spanish, _, _, _, dog), Houses),
% ... and so on for all member/2 calls
```

The corrected implementation should then be able to find the unique solution to the zebra puzzle, identifying which house contains the zebra and which resident drinks water.
