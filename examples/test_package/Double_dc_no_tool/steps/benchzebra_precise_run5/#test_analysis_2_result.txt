# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" which determines the arrangement of houses based on given constraints. The solution must satisfy 15 distinct logical rules about house positions, nationalities, colors, drinks, cigarettes, and pets.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned:
```prolog
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,water,kools,fox), 
       house(ukrainian,blue,tea,chesterfields,horse), 
       house(english,red,milk,winstons,snail), 
       house(spanish,ivory,orange,lucky_strikes,dog), 
       house(japanese,green,coffee,parliaments,zebra)]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution correctly satisfies all 15 constraints of the puzzle:
1. English in red house ✓
2. Spanish has dog ✓
3. Green house drinks coffee ✓
4. Ukrainian drinks tea ✓
5. Green right of ivory ✓
6. Winstons smoker has snails ✓
7. Yellow house smokes Kools ✓
8. Middle house drinks milk ✓
9. First house is Norwegian ✓
10. Chesterfields next to fox ✓
11. Kools next to horse ✓
12. Orange juice with Lucky Strikes ✓
13. Japanese smoke Parliaments ✓
14. Norwegian next to blue house ✓
15. Contains zebra and water drinker ✓

## Failure Localization
N/A - All constraints were satisfied in the solution.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct:
1. **Logical correctness**: All constraints are properly encoded with correct predicate usage
2. **Recursive termination**: Helper predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) have proper base cases
3. **Probabilistic compliance**: Though this is a deterministic puzzle, the probability 1.0000 correctly reflects certainty
4. **DeepProbLog feature**: Not used in this solution (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
The solution meets all functional requirements for classical logical reasoning. Key strengths include:
- Proper use of list manipulation predicates
- Correct constraint ordering
- Efficient solving through Prolog's backtracking

Edge cases handled correctly:
- All houses are properly initialized
- Positional constraints work at list boundaries
- No undefined predicates

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints satisfied. No errors were found in the logical formulation or constraint satisfaction. The solution demonstrates proper use of ProbLog for deterministic logical puzzles.
