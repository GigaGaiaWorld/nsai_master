</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code uses logical constraints to determine the arrangement of houses with specific attributes. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and analyze its compliance with ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned exactly one solution with probability 1.0000:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution satisfies all 15 constraints of the original puzzle:
1. Englishman in red house
2. Spaniard owns dog
3. Coffee in green house
4. Ukrainian drinks tea
5. Green house immediately to right of ivory
6. Winston smoker owns snails
7. Kools smoked in yellow house
8. Milk in middle house
9. Norwegian in first house
10. Chesterfield smoker next to fox
11. Kools smoker next to horse
12. Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice
13. Japanese smokes Parliaments
14. Norwegian next to blue house
15. Zebra and water locations correctly identified

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in:
- Main `zebra/1` predicate (lines 1-18)
- Helper predicates:
  - `my_member/2` (correct list membership check)
  - `next_to/3` (proper neighbor relation using `right_of/3`)
  - `right_of/3` (correct positional relationship)

## Root Cause Analysis
### Logical Correctness
- All constraints are properly implemented as logical predicates
- Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) have proper base cases and recursive cases
- No infinite recursion risks due to proper list handling

### Probabilistic Aspects
- The solution is purely deterministic (probability 1.0000)
- No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

### Constraint Satisfaction
The solution correctly handles all edge cases:
- Positional constraints (right_of/next_to)
- Attribute uniqueness (no duplicate colors/nationalities/etc.)
- Boundary conditions (first/last house handling)

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
| Requirement | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Classical reasoning | Fully implemented |
| Probabilistic reasoning | Not utilized |
| Neural network integration | Not utilized |

### Edge Case Verification
1. **List boundaries**: Proper handling of first/last house positions
2. **Attribute uniqueness**: Implicitly enforced through constraint satisfaction
3. **Positional relations**: Correct implementation of `right_of/3` and `next_to/3`
4. **Middle house constraint**: Explicit check for milk in position 3

## Error Summary
| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | - |

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly enforced. While the solution is purely deterministic, it demonstrates correct use of logical programming in ProbLog. For a more probabilistic approach, the implementation could be extended with uncertain facts or weighted constraints.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
