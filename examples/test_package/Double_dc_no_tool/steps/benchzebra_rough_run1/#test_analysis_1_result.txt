# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code uses logical constraints to determine the arrangement of houses with specific attributes. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation and analyze its compliance with ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `zebra(Houses)` returned exactly one solution with probability 1.0000:
```
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution satisfies all 15 constraints of the original puzzle:
1. Englishman in red house
2. Spaniard owns dog
3. Coffee in green house
4. Ukrainian drinks tea
5. Green house immediately to right of ivory
6. Winston smoker owns snails
7. Kools smoked in yellow house
8. Milk in middle house
9. Norwegian in first house
10. Chesterfield smoker next to fox
11. Kools smoker next to horse
12. Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice
13. Japanese smokes Parliaments
14. Norwegian next to blue house
15. Zebra and water locations correctly identified

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in:
- Main `zebra/1` predicate (lines 1-18)
- Helper predicates:
  - `my_member/2` (correct list membership check)
  - `next_to/3` (proper neighbor relation using `right_of/3`)
  - `right_of/3` (correct positional relationship)

## Root Cause Analysis
### Logical Correctness
- All constraints are properly implemented as logical predicates
- Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) have proper base cases and recursive cases
- No infinite recursion risks due to proper list handling

### Probabilistic Aspects
- The solution is purely deterministic (probability 1.0000)
- No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

### Constraint Satisfaction
The solution correctly handles all edge cases:
- Positional constraints (right_of/next_to)
- Attribute uniqueness (no duplicate colors/nationalities/etc.)
- Boundary conditions (first/last house handling)

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
| Requirement | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Classical reasoning | Fully implemented |
| Probabilistic reasoning | Not utilized |
| Neural network integration | Not utilized |

### Edge Case Verification
1. **List boundaries**: Proper handling of first/last house positions
2. **Attribute uniqueness**: Implicitly enforced through constraint satisfaction
3. **Positional relations**: Correct implementation of `right_of/3` and `next_to/3`
4. **Middle house constraint**: Explicit check for milk in position 3

## Error Summary
| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | - |

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly enforced. While the solution is purely deterministic, it demonstrates correct use of logical programming in ProbLog. For a more probabilistic approach, the implementation could be extended with uncertain facts or weighted constraints.
