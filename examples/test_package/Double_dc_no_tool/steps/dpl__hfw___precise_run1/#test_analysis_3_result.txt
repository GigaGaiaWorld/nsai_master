# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to map images to numbers and operators, then recursively parses the expression using `parse/2` predicates with `almost_equal/2` for floating-point comparison.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
- Query: `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)`
- Error: CallModeError for `</2` due to non-ground arguments in `almost_equal/2`

## Failure Localization
1. **Failed Component**: `almost_equal/2` predicate (line 24)
   - Error Type: CallModeError
   - Problem: Attempting to compare non-ground arithmetic expression `abs(X1-2*7.0)` with constant `0.0001`
   - Affected Rule: All `parse/2` rules that perform arithmetic operations

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Flow Issue**:
   - The recursive parsing works correctly in principle
   - The error occurs during floating-point comparison when one argument isn't ground
   - Current implementation violates ProbLog's requirement for ground arguments in arithmetic comparisons

2. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The error is purely related to classical Prolog evaluation

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network predicates like `nn/3` or tensor operations)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical parsing logic is correctly structured but fails in execution
   - No probabilistic reasoning requirements were implemented
   - No neural network integration attempted

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-ground arithmetic comparisons not handled
   - No input validation for malformed expressions
   - No protection against division by zero
   - No handling of operator precedence (current implementation is strictly left-associative)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground comparison in almost_equal/2 | Prevents expression evaluation | Restructure to ensure ground values before comparison |
| 2 | Left-associative evaluation only | Incorrect results for standard arithmetic | Implement operator precedence handling |
| 3 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add validation predicates |

## Recommended Fixes
```prolog
% Revised almost_equal/2 predicate
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), ground(Y), 
    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(Y), var(X), 
    X is float(Y).
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), var(Y), 
    Y is float(X).

% Revised parse/2 for operations (example for addition)
parse([N1,+|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    R_val is N1 + R2,
    almost_equal(R, R_val).
```

The main issue stems from attempting to perform arithmetic comparison before fully evaluating the expression. The solution requires ensuring all values are ground before comparison and properly structuring the evaluation order. The revised version separates the calculation from the comparison step.
