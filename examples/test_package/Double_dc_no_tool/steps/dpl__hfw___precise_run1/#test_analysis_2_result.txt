# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to translate images into symbols, then parses the resulting list into arithmetic expressions with `parse/2` and `expression/2` predicates.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```
Returned result:
```
expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7],X2) = 0.0000
```

**Test Status**: Failure. The expected result should be approximately -13.6666 (from 2/(3+3)-2*7), but the system returned 0.0000.

## Failure Localization
1. **Missing Parse Rules**: The system only contains the addition case (`parse([N1,+|T], R)`) but lacks rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Incorrect Result Handling**: The returned probability of 0.0000 suggests the query failed to find any valid proof path.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Completeness**: The parser is incomplete - it only handles addition operations but not the other three required operations (subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. **Recursive Structure**: While the recursive structure for parsing is correctly set up in `detect_all/2`, the `parse/2` predicate lacks necessary cases.
3. **Probability Handling**: Since this is a purely deterministic case, the probability should be 1.0 for correct answers. The 0.0000 result indicates complete failure.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (only addition works)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
   - Neural network integration: Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Operator precedence not implemented
   - Division by zero not prevented
   - Incomplete operator set

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing parse rules for -, *, / | Cannot evaluate full expressions | Add all four operator cases |
| 2 | Incorrect probability reporting | Misleading results | Ensure deterministic queries return 1.0 |
| 3 | No operator precedence | Incorrect evaluation order | Implement precedence rules or parenthesization |
| 4 | No error handling | Crashes on invalid input | Add input validation |

**Recommendation**: Implement all four operator cases in `parse/2` with proper recursive structure and add basic error handling for division by zero cases. The corrected parser should handle the full expression: 2/(3+3)-2*7 â‰ˆ -13.6666.
