</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The solution uses constraint logic programming to determine the arrangement of houses based on given clues. The evaluation focuses on verifying logical correctness, predicate definitions, and test results.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with a single query:
```prolog
query(zebra(Houses)).
```

**Result:**
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
      house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
      house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
      house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
      house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all puzzle constraints:
1. Correct color-nationality pairing
2. Proper animal assignments
3. Valid beverage and cigarette relationships
4. Correct spatial relationships between houses

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates sound logical reasoning:
1. **Classical Prolog Aspects:**
   - All recursive predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`) have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - Constraints are properly ordered for efficient solving
   - No infinite recursion risks

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The solution shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness
   - No probabilistic facts or rules were used (pure logical solution)
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

3. **Constraint Satisfaction:**
   - All 15 puzzle clues are correctly encoded
   - Spatial relationships (`right_of`, `next_to`) are properly implemented

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully satisfied with correct puzzle solution
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure logical problem)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. The fixed 5-house structure prevents non-list inputs
2. Recursion depth is limited to list length (5 elements)
3. All member checks handle empty lists gracefully via recursion
4. Spatial relationships work bidirectionally (`next_to`)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for house structure
2. Consider performance optimization for larger puzzles
3. Add explanatory comments for each constraint

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | N/A |

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly enforced. The helper predicates are correctly defined and the solution demonstrates proper logical reasoning without any probabilistic or neural network components.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
