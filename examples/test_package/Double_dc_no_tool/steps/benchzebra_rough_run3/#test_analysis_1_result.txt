# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The solution uses constraint logic programming to determine the arrangement of houses based on given clues. The evaluation focuses on verifying logical correctness, predicate definitions, and test results.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with a single query:
```prolog
query(zebra(Houses)).
```

**Result:**
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
      house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
      house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
      house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
      house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The solution correctly satisfies all puzzle constraints:
1. Correct color-nationality pairing
2. Proper animal assignments
3. Valid beverage and cigarette relationships
4. Correct spatial relationships between houses

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All helper predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates sound logical reasoning:
1. **Classical Prolog Aspects:**
   - All recursive predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`) have proper base cases and recursive cases
   - Constraints are properly ordered for efficient solving
   - No infinite recursion risks

2. **Probabilistic Aspects:**
   - The solution shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness
   - No probabilistic facts or rules were used (pure logical solution)
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

3. **Constraint Satisfaction:**
   - All 15 puzzle clues are correctly encoded
   - Spatial relationships (`right_of`, `next_to`) are properly implemented

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully satisfied with correct puzzle solution
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure logical problem)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. The fixed 5-house structure prevents non-list inputs
2. Recursion depth is limited to list length (5 elements)
3. All member checks handle empty lists gracefully via recursion
4. Spatial relationships work bidirectionally (`next_to`)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for house structure
2. Consider performance optimization for larger puzzles
3. Add explanatory comments for each constraint

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | N/A |

The implementation correctly solves the Zebra Puzzle with all constraints properly enforced. The helper predicates are correctly defined and the solution demonstrates proper logical reasoning without any probabilistic or neural network components.
