    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin flips and count successes. The program uses recursive predicates to track successful outcomes (heads) across multiple coin flips. The evaluation focuses on verifying logical correctness, handling probabilistic facts, and identifying any implementation errors.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the error message:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16
```
No successful queries were executed due to this fatal error. The program failed before producing any probability results.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the recursive predicate `coins_r/3` (lines 8-16) where the conditional operator `->/2` is used. ProbLog doesn't natively support the Prolog conditional operator in this context. The specific problematic section is:
```prolog
(coin(CNT) ->
    SC1 is SC + 1,
    coins_r(SC1,S,CNT1)
;
    coins_r(SC,S,CNT1)
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The recursive logic is conceptually correct (decrementing counter, conditional accumulation), but uses Prolog-specific syntax incompatible with ProbLog.
2. **Probabilistic Handling**: The program attempts to use probabilistic facts (`coin(C)`) but fails before evaluation due to syntax issues.
3. **Termination**: The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined, but never reached due to the earlier error.
4. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration is present ("DeepProbLog feature not used").

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but non-functional
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not properly executed
   - Neural integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The conditional operator implementation is problematic
   - No handling for negative counter values
   - No validation for coin probability ranges

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported conditional operator (`->/2`) | Complete failure | Replace with ProbLog-compatible if-then-else structure |
| 2 | No error handling for invalid inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation predicates |
| 3 | Direct arithmetic in probabilistic context | Potential incorrect probability calculations | Use ProbLog's probabilistic assignment |

## Recommended Fixes
1. Replace the conditional with ProbLog-compatible syntax:
```prolog
toss_coin(CNT, SC, SC1) :-
    coin(CNT) ~= true,
    SC1 is SC + 1.
toss_coin(_, SC, SC).

coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    toss_coin(CNT, SC, NewSC),
    coins_r(NewSC,S,CNT1).
```

2. Add proper probability handling:
```prolog
0.8::coin(C).
```

The corrected implementation should properly handle the probabilistic coin flips while maintaining the recursive counting structure originally intended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
