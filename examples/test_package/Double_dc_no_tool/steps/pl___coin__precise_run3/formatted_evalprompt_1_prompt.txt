    raise UnmatchedCharacter(string, expr_stack[-1].start.location)
problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character '(' at 7:1.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a probabilistic bias. The program should count successful outcomes (heads) when tossing multiple coins, where each coin has an 80% probability of landing heads. The evaluation focuses on syntax correctness, logical structure, and probabilistic reasoning implementation.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error:
```
Unmatched character '(' at 7:1
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this fundamental syntax issue. The error occurs before any probabilistic reasoning or recursive evaluation can take place.

## 3. Failure Localization
The error originates from line 7, where there's an unmatched parenthesis in the conditional statement. The problematic section is:
```prolog
<Code_Block>(coin(CNT) -> 
        NewSC is SC + 1, 
        NewCNT is CNT - 1, 
        coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT)
    ; 
        NewCNT is CNT - 1, 
        coins_r(SC,S,NewCNT)</Code_Block>
```

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues identified are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The code block is incorrectly formatted with XML-like tags (`<Code_Block>`) that are not valid ProbLog syntax. These should be removed.

2. **Structural Problems**: The conditional statement is not properly integrated into the ProbLog rule. In ProbLog, conditionals should use the standard Prolog syntax without XML tags.

3. **Probabilistic Context**: While the intended probabilistic reasoning (80% heads probability) is correctly specified in the `coin/1` fact, the execution never reaches this point due to the syntax error.

## 5. Overall Analysis
The code fails to meet any functional requirements due to the syntax error. Key observations:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Not testable due to syntax error
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: The `coin(C)` definition is correct but unused
3. **Neural Network Integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used

Edge cases that would need consideration if the syntax were corrected:
- Base case termination in `coins_r/3`
- Proper handling of the counter decrement
- Probability accumulation in the recursive case

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | XML tags in ProbLog code | Complete failure | Remove all non-Problog markup |
| 2 | Unmatched parentheses | Syntax error | Use standard Prolog conditional syntax |
| 3 | Improper rule structure | Logical flow broken | Format rules with proper Prolog syntax |

**Recommendation**: Rewrite the code using proper ProbLog syntax, removing all XML-like tags and ensuring proper conditional statement formatting. The corrected version should use standard Prolog `( Condition -> Then ; Else )` syntax directly in the rule body without any markup tags.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
