# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program calculates population density from provided population and area facts, then compares densities between country pairs.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test cases passed successfully:
```
query_pop([china, 244.0828402366864, france, 246.4788732394366]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223.859649122807, pakistan, 219.2926045016077]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477.58620689655174, philippines, 461.1111111111111]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77.71428571428571, mexico, 76.04712041884817]) = 1.0000
```
**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly show country pairs with density differences â‰¤5% and confirm the implementation meets requirements.

## 3. Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The implementation correctly:
1. Calculates density using `density/2` predicate
2. Compares country pairs with `@<` to avoid duplicates
3. Validates the 5% threshold with relative difference calculation

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical ProbLog behavior:
- **Logical Correctness**: The density calculation `Density is (Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000)` properly scales the input units (population in 100,000s and area in 1,000 sq miles)
- **Comparison Logic**: The relative difference check `abs(Density1 - Density2) / min(Density1, Density2) =< 0.05` correctly implements the 5% requirement
- **Termination**: The program terminates as it uses finite facts and non-recursive rules

**Probabilistic Aspects**: 
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used (all probabilities = 1.0000)
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for density calculation and comparison
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required/used in this solution
- Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Country pair ordering (`Country1 @< Country2`) prevents duplicate pairs
2. Relative difference calculation handles all density value ranges
3. Input validation not needed as the program only queries existing facts

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for undefined countries
2. Consider adding probabilistic weights for data reliability
3. Could extend with DeepProbLog for predictive density modeling
