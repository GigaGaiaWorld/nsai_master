# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from image identifiers, converts them to symbolic representations, and computes the mathematical result using recursive parsing with floating-point precision handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided evaluates the expression "2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7" using image identifiers:
```problog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

**Result:**
- Returned value: `-0.25` with probability `1.0000`
- Expected value: `-0.25` (2/6 - 14 = -13.666... → Wait, this appears incorrect)

**Discrepancy Found:**
The actual computation should be:
1. 3 + 3 = 6
2. 2 / 6 ≈ 0.333
3. 2 * 7 = 14
4. 0.333 - 14 ≈ -13.666

But the system returned -0.25, indicating incorrect operator precedence handling.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the parsing logic (lines containing the `parse/2` predicates). The current implementation processes operations strictly left-to-right without respecting mathematical precedence rules, leading to:
1. First evaluating 2/3 ≈ 0.666
2. Then 0.666+3 ≈ 3.666
3. Then 3.666-2 ≈ 1.666
4. Finally 1.666*7 ≈ 11.666 → Not matching either result

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - Missing parentheses handling in the parser
   - No operator precedence implementation (PEMDAS rules)
   - Left-associative evaluation only

2. **ProbLog Aspects**:
   - Correct probability handling (1.0 for deterministic facts)
   - No probabilistic facts or neural network calls used ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

3. **Precision Handling**:
   - `almost_equal/2` works correctly for floating-point comparisons
   - Precision threshold (0.0001) is appropriate

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Basic expression parsing: Partially met (incorrect precedence)
- Floating-point handling: Fully met
- Image-to-symbol conversion: Fully met
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized
- Neural integration: Not utilized

**Edge Cases Not Handled:**
- Parenthesized expressions
- Division by zero
- Invalid input formats
- Mixed operator precedence
- Unary operators

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing operator precedence | Incorrect results | Implement PEMDAS rules |
| 2 | Left-associative only | Limited expressions | Add right-associative cases |
| 3 | No parentheses support | Can't handle nested expressions | Add parenthesized parse cases |
| 4 | No error handling | Crashes on invalid input | Add validation predicates |

**Recommendations:**
1. Restructure parser to handle operator precedence
2. Add parenthesized expression support
3. Include input validation
4. Add division-by-zero protection
5. Consider adding exponentiation support

The current implementation works for simple left-to-right expressions but fails to handle standard arithmetic precedence rules. The core parsing mechanism needs restructuring to properly evaluate mathematical expressions.
