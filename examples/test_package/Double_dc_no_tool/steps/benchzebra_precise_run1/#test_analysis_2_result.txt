# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (Einstein's Riddle). The code defines constraints for house arrangements and attempts to solve which house contains the zebra. The evaluation verifies logical correctness and requirement compliance.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test produced one result:
```
zebra([house(norwegian,yellow,water,kools,fox), 
      house(ukrainian,blue,tea,chesterfields,horse), 
      house(english,red,milk,winstons,snail), 
      house(spanish,ivory,orange_juice,lucky_strikes,dog), 
      house(japanese,green,coffee,parliaments,zebra)]) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The solution correctly satisfies all 15 puzzle constraints:
1. English in red house ✓
2. Spanish has dog ✓
3. Green house drinks coffee ✓
4. Ukrainian drinks tea ✓
5. Green right of ivory ✓
6. Winstons smoker has snails ✓
7. Yellow house smokes Kools ✓
8. Middle house drinks milk ✓
9. First house is Norwegian ✓
10. Chesterfields next to fox ✓
11. Kools next to horse ✓
12. Orange juice with Lucky Strikes ✓
13. Japanese smoke Parliaments ✓
14. Norwegian next to blue house ✓
15. Zebra and water drinker exist ✓

## 3. Failure Localization
No failures detected. All helper predicates function correctly:
- `right_of/3` (lines 28-29)
- `next_to/3` (lines 30-32)
- `my_member/2` (lines 33-34)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Logic Analysis
- **Termination**: Recursive predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) all properly handle base cases and list decomposition
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: All puzzle rules are correctly translated to Prolog constraints with proper variable binding

### Probabilistic Analysis
- The solution uses classical ProbLog (probability = 1.0000)
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls)

## 5. Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
| Category          | Status  | Notes                          |
|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| Classical Logic   | Fully   | All constraints satisfied      |
| Probabilistic     | N/A     | Not used in this solution      |
| Neural Networks   | N/A     | DeepProbLog not utilized       |

### Edge Case Verification
1. **List Structure**: Houses must be a 5-element list - enforced by initial `houses/1` fact
2. **Position Constraints**: Middle house milk (position 3) and Norwegian first are explicitly checked
3. **Neighbor Relations**: `next_to` and `right_of` handle all adjacency cases

## 6. Error Summary
No errors were found in the implementation. The solution is logically complete and correctly implements all puzzle constraints.

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None    | -      | -          |

**Word Count**: 398 words

The implementation demonstrates correct use of Prolog's constraint solving capabilities to solve a classic logic puzzle, with all requirements properly translated into executable constraints. The deterministic nature of the solution (probability 1.0) is appropriate for this type of puzzle.
