# Code Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" (also known as Einstein's Riddle). The puzzle requires determining the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose is to verify the logical correctness of the implementation and identify any errors in the ProbLog code.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs because:
1. The code uses `member/2` predicate (line 4) but this predicate is not defined in the ProbLog standard library
2. While the code includes a definition for `my_member/2`, it's not being used in the main constraints
3. Line number interval: The error originates from the first use of `member/2` at line 4 through all subsequent constraints using this predicate

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The root cause is a predicate naming inconsistency:
1. Classical Prolog context: The code defines `my_member/2` but attempts to use `member/2`
2. The recursive definitions for `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` appear correct and would terminate properly
3. No probabilistic facts or neural network components are used in this implementation ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## 5. Overall Analysis
The implementation fails to meet functional requirements due to the predicate naming issue. Key observations:
1. **Classical reasoning**: The logical structure of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented (if the predicate issue were fixed)
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Not utilized in this implementation
3. **Edge cases**: The code doesn't handle non-list inputs for the house arrangement

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Complete failure of the program | Replace all `member/2` calls with `my_member/2` or properly import the member predicate |
| 2 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors with invalid inputs | Add type checking for house list structure |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements used | Limited to classical reasoning | Consider adding probabilistic constraints if needed |

## 7. Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
zebra(Houses) :-
    houses(Houses),
    my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(spanish, _, _, _, dog), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, green, coffee, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(ukrainian, _, tea, _, _), Houses),
    right_of(house(_, green, _, _, _), house(_, ivory, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, winstons, snail), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, yellow, _, kools, _), Houses),
    Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, milk, _, _), _, _],
    Houses = [house(norwegian, _, _, _, _)|_],
    next_to(house(_, _, _, chesterfields, _), house(_, _, _, _, fox), Houses),
    next_to(house(_, _, _, kools, _), house(_, _, _, _, horse), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, orange_juice, lucky_strikes, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(japanese, _, _, parliaments, _), Houses),
    next_to(house(norwegian, _, _, _, _), house(_, blue, _, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, water, _, _), Houses),
    my_member(house(_, _, _, _, zebra), Houses).
```

The corrected version would work as intended, solving the classic zebra puzzle by finding the correct arrangement of houses that satisfies all given constraints.
