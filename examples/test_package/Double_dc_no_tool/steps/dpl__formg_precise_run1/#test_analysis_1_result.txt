# Code Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The code recursively splits a list, sorts the sublists, and merges them back together. The evaluation focuses on functional correctness, recursive termination, and edge case handling in classical ProbLog scenarios.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
**Result:**
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting and merging
3. List concatenation through append/3

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical ProbLog:
1. **Recursive Termination**: The base cases ([], [X]) ensure termination
2. **List Splitting**: split_list/3 correctly divides lists using length//2
3. **Merging Logic**: merge/3 properly handles all comparison cases (H1 =< H2 and H1 > H2)

Probabilistic aspects are trivial in this case as the implementation doesn't use probabilistic facts - all operations are deterministic with probability 1.0000.

DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation meets all functional requirements for classical list sorting:
1. Correctly implements the merge sort algorithm
2. Handles edge cases (empty and single-element lists)
3. Maintains proper recursive structure

**Potential edge cases to consider:**
1. Non-list inputs (currently would fail silently)
2. Very large lists (deep recursion might cause stack issues)
3. Lists with duplicate elements (handled correctly in current implementation)

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | None | Consider adding input validation for non-list cases |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Add tests for edge cases (duplicates, large lists) |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Consider probabilistic extensions (e.g., uncertain comparisons) |

The implementation is correct for the tested cases but could benefit from additional robustness checks and expanded test coverage for edge cases. The core sorting functionality works as expected in classical ProbLog contexts.
