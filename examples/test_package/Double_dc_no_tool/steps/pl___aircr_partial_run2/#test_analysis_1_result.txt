# Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under varying wind conditions and actuator strengths, with probabilistic outcomes for reaching the target position (goal) or encountering overrun exceptions. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability values without failures:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results show consistent probability distributions that properly account for all possible wind effects and actuator choices.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates function as intended:
- `flap_position/2` (Lines 12-14) correctly validates legal positions
- `overrun_exception/1` (Lines 16-18) properly detects illegal positions
- `goal_reached/1` (Lines 20-22) accurately checks goal attainment
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (Lines 24-33) computes valid new positions

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic computations are mathematically sound:
1. Actuator selection follows the defined 50/50 distribution
2. Wind effects properly implement conditional probabilities:
   - Weak wind: 70% chance with symmetric [-1,0,1] distribution
   - Strong wind: 30% chance with asymmetric [-3,-2,2,3] distribution
3. Probability rules are correctly applied:
   - `P(Â¬legal_position) = 1-P(legal_position)` in overrun detection
   - Joint probabilities correctly computed for actuator+wind combinations

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network integration present.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly handles position validation and goal checking
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately models stochastic wind/actuator effects
3. **Edge cases**:
   - Initial position (6) and goal (4) are properly defined
   - Time bounds (1-5) are correctly constrained
   - Illegal positions (negative or >10) trigger overrun exceptions

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation demonstrates robust handling of all specified scenarios with proper probabilistic computation. The decreasing probability of `goal_reached` over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty from wind effects, while the low but non-zero `overrun_exception` probabilities show proper handling of edge cases. No improvements are currently needed beyond potential future extensions with DeepProbLog features if neural network integration becomes desirable.
