# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that models coin tossing behavior. The code defines probabilistic coins with an 80% chance of landing heads and implements recursive counting of heads from multiple coin tosses. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both the logical implementation and probabilistic calculations.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for getting 0 to 4 heads when tossing 4 coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The probability results correctly follow the binomial distribution for 4 trials with p=0.8, matching expected theoretical values.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly handles both cases (coin head and tail) and properly accumulates the results.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` properly terminates recursion
   - The recursive cases correctly handle both success (`coin(CNT)`) and failure (`\+ coin(CNT)`) scenarios
   - Counter decrement ensures termination

2. **Probabilistic Calculations**:
   - The probability of heads (0.8) is properly defined via `PH::make_coin(C,PH)`
   - The negation probability (0.2 for tails) is correctly handled via `\+ coin(CNT)`
   - The combined probabilities match binomial distribution: P(k heads in n trials) = C(n,k)*p^k*(1-p)^(n-k)

3. **DeepProbLog Features**:
   - DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration present)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Classical reasoning: Fully implemented via recursive counting
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Correctly models coin toss probabilities
   - Neural network integration: Not required for this task

2. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - Base case (0 coins) properly handled
   - Negative counts would fail due to `CNT > 0` check
   - Non-integer inputs would cause type errors
   - Deep recursion not an issue for small CNT values

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |

The implementation correctly models the probabilistic coin tossing scenario with proper recursive counting and accurate probability calculations. All test cases match expected theoretical values, confirming the implementation's correctness.
