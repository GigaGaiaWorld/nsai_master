    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its functionality and identifying any issues in the implementation. The code was tested with a query to sort the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`, but resulted in an error during execution.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed to execute, producing the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12
```
No successful test results were obtained due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at line 4 (character position 12) where the if-then-else construct `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` is used. The ProbLog engine cannot process this standard Prolog control structure.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm's logic appears correct for a standard Prolog implementation, using proper recursive termination (base cases for empty list and single element) and comparison-based sorting.
2. **ProbLog Compatibility**: The main issue stems from ProbLog's limited support for Prolog's control structures. ProbLog requires special handling of conditional statements.
3. **DeepProbLog Features**: DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls present).

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The implementation fails to meet requirements due to ProbLog incompatibility, though the classical sorting logic is correct.
2. **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles basic edge cases (empty list, single element) correctly in standard Prolog, but:
   - Non-list input would cause type errors
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with large lists
   - ProbLog's restricted syntax isn't properly accommodated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog doesn't support Prolog's if-then-else syntax | Complete failure | Rewrite using ProbLog-compatible conditionals or use `if/3` predicate |
| 2 | No type checking for input | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |
| 3 | No handling of probabilistic elements | Limited to deterministic sorting | Consider adding probabilistic facts if needed |

## Recommended Fix
Replace the if-then-else construct with ProbLog-compatible logic:
```prolog
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X > Y,
    bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted).
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X =< Y,
    bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted).
```

This solution separates the conditions into different clauses, which ProbLog can process correctly while maintaining the same sorting functionality.

**Word Count**: 423 words

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
