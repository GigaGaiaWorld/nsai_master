# Bubblesort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm. The code should correctly sort lists of numbers in ascending order using the classic bubble sort methodology. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, termination conditions, and proper handling of edge cases.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[]) = 1.0000
```

**Test Status:** FAILURE  
The test failed because the result shows an empty list as output when it should return the sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the main sorting predicate `bubblesort/3`. The issue stems from:
1. Incorrect accumulation pattern in the base cases (lines 1 and 4 of the code block)
2. The accumulator `Acc` is not properly building the sorted list

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error:** The base cases incorrectly return the accumulator without properly building the sorted list. The predicate should build the sorted list through the bubble operations.

2. **Termination Issue:** While the recursion terminates correctly, the final sorted result isn't properly constructed and returned.

3. **Probabilistic Context:** Not applicable in this case as this is pure Prolog without probabilistic elements. DeepProbLog features were not used.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements:** The basic sorting functionality is not met due to the logical error in result construction.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty list handling is correct
   - Single-element lists are handled correctly
   - The code would fail with non-list inputs (no type checking)
   - Performance for large lists would be poor (O(nÂ²) as expected for bubble sort)

3. **Code Structure:**
   - The `bubble/2` predicate is correctly implemented
   - The sorting logic flow is conceptually correct but incorrectly implemented in `bubblesort/3`

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect result accumulation in bubblesort/3 | Returns empty list instead of sorted list | Rewrite the base cases to properly return the sorted list |
| 2 | No input validation | Would fail with non-list inputs | Add type checking or documentation |
| 3 | No probabilistic features used | N/A | Not applicable for this evaluation |

## Recommended Fix
The `bubblesort/3` predicate should be modified to:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Sorted) :- bubblesort(List, [], Sorted).

bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(List, NewList),
    NewList \= List,
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted).
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(List, List),
    Sorted = List.
```

This change ensures proper accumulation of the sorted result while maintaining the correct sorting logic.
