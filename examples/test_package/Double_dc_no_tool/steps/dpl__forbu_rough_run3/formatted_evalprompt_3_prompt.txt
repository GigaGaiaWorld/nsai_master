System: You are a coding assistant. You should complete the task.
Human: You are an expert code evaluator specialized in ProbLog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to analyze the provided code and its test results, strictly following the instructions below.

 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Bubblesort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm. The code should correctly sort lists of numbers in ascending order using the classic bubble sort methodology. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, termination conditions, and proper handling of edge cases.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[]) = 1.0000
```

**Test Status:** FAILURE  
The test failed because the result shows an empty list as output when it should return the sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the main sorting predicate `bubblesort/3`. The issue stems from:
1. Incorrect accumulation pattern in the base cases (lines 1 and 4 of the code block)
2. The accumulator `Acc` is not properly building the sorted list

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error:** The base cases incorrectly return the accumulator without properly building the sorted list. The predicate should build the sorted list through the bubble operations.

2. **Termination Issue:** While the recursion terminates correctly, the final sorted result isn't properly constructed and returned.

3. **Probabilistic Context:** Not applicable in this case as this is pure Prolog without probabilistic elements. DeepProbLog features were not used.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements:** The basic sorting functionality is not met due to the logical error in result construction.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty list handling is correct
   - Single-element lists are handled correctly
   - The code would fail with non-list inputs (no type checking)
   - Performance for large lists would be poor (O(n²) as expected for bubble sort)

3. **Code Structure:**
   - The `bubble/2` predicate is correctly implemented
   - The sorting logic flow is conceptually correct but incorrectly implemented in `bubblesort/3`

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incorrect result accumulation in bubblesort/3 | Returns empty list instead of sorted list | Rewrite the base cases to properly return the sorted list |
| 2 | No input validation | Would fail with non-list inputs | Add type checking or documentation |
| 3 | No probabilistic features used | N/A | Not applicable for this evaluation |

## Recommended Fix
The `bubblesort/3` predicate should be modified to:
```prolog
bubblesort(List, Sorted) :- bubblesort(List, [], Sorted).

bubblesort([], Acc, Acc).
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(List, NewList),
    NewList \= List,
    bubblesort(NewList, Acc, Sorted).
bubblesort(List, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(List, List),
    Sorted = List.
```

This change ensures proper accumulation of the sorted result while maintaining the correct sorting logic.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
