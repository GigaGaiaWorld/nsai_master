# Prolog Bubblesort Implementation Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the bubblesort algorithm, specifically analyzing its functionality and identifying any issues in the implementation. The code was tested with a query to sort the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`, but resulted in an error during execution.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` failed to execute, producing the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12
```
No successful test results were obtained due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at line 4 (character position 12) where the if-then-else construct `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` is used. The ProbLog engine cannot process this standard Prolog control structure.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm's logic appears correct for a standard Prolog implementation, using proper recursive termination (base cases for empty list and single element) and comparison-based sorting.
2. **ProbLog Compatibility**: The main issue stems from ProbLog's limited support for Prolog's control structures. ProbLog requires special handling of conditional statements.
3. **DeepProbLog Features**: DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls present).

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**: The implementation fails to meet requirements due to ProbLog incompatibility, though the classical sorting logic is correct.
2. **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles basic edge cases (empty list, single element) correctly in standard Prolog, but:
   - Non-list input would cause type errors
   - Deep recursion could cause stack issues with large lists
   - ProbLog's restricted syntax isn't properly accommodated

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ProbLog doesn't support Prolog's if-then-else syntax | Complete failure | Rewrite using ProbLog-compatible conditionals or use `if/3` predicate |
| 2 | No type checking for input | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation |
| 3 | No handling of probabilistic elements | Limited to deterministic sorting | Consider adding probabilistic facts if needed |

## Recommended Fix
Replace the if-then-else construct with ProbLog-compatible logic:
```prolog
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X > Y,
    bubblesort([X|Rest], [Y|Acc], Sorted).
bubblesort([X,Y|Rest], Acc, Sorted) :-
    X =< Y,
    bubblesort([Y|Rest], [X|Acc], Sorted).
```

This solution separates the conditions into different clauses, which ProbLog can process correctly while maintaining the same sorting functionality.
