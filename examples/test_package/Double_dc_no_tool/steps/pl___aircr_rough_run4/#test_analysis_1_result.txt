# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under wind effects using probabilistic actuators. The purpose is to verify correct probabilistic reasoning about goal achievement and exception handling within a 5-step timeframe.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries executed successfully with the following probability distributions:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results show logically consistent probability distributions that properly account for all possible actuator choices and wind effects.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Position calculation via `attempted_flap_position/2` (lines 18-25)
2. Legal position validation via `legal_flap_position/1` (line 2)
3. Probabilistic actuator selection (lines 5-6)
4. Wind effect modeling (lines 8-10)
5. Goal checking (lines 13-15)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning adheres to standard probability rules:
1. Actuator selection follows P(a)=0.5, P(b)=0.5 (disjoint exhaustive)
2. Wind effects properly condition on wind strength (weak/strong)
3. Position calculation combines deterministic (actuator strength) and probabilistic (wind) components
4. Negation in `\+ legal_flap_position` correctly computes 1-P(legal)

Key recursive termination points:
- Base case: `flap_position(0,6)`
- Stopping condition: `goal_reached/1` prevents infinite recursion

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Correct position validation and goal checking
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Proper combination of actuator choice and wind effects
3. Neural integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases Verified:**
1. Position bounds (0-10) enforced by `legal_flap_position/1`
2. Wind effects properly constrained to discrete values
3. Time-bound execution via `at(5)`
4. Initial position and goal properly defined

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic modeling of a safety-critical system with proper handling of environmental uncertainties and actuator choices. The decreasing probability of `goal_reached` over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty from wind effects, while the low `overrun_exception` probabilities show robust bounds checking.
