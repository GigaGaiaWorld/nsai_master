# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Prolog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population density from given population and area data, then finds country pairs where one density is slightly higher than another (within a 5% margin).

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful queries:
```
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All queries returned expected results with probability 1.0000, indicating perfect matches within the specified density ratio constraints.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The program correctly:
- Calculates densities using integer division (line 12-14)
- Applies the 5% margin comparison (line 7-9)
- Returns valid country pairs where 20*D1 < 21*D2 while D1 > D2

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - Density calculation: `D is (P*100)//A` properly handles integer arithmetic
   - Comparison logic enforces D1 > D2 while keeping them within 5% (T1 < T2)

2. **Termination**:
   - All predicates are non-recursive with finite facts
   - No risk of infinite recursion

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - Pure classical Prolog (no probabilistic facts/rules)
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used"

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Classical reasoning: Correct population density calculations and comparisons
- ❌ Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (pure deterministic program)
- ❌ Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. **Undefined countries**: Would fail silently (no explicit handling)
2. **Division by zero**: Prevented by complete area data
3. **Non-list input**: Query expects list format [C1,D1,C2,D2]
4. **Data ranges**: Handles large integer calculations properly

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None detected | N/A | Consider adding input validation |
| 2 | N/A | N/A | Could extend with probabilistic facts |
| 3 | N/A | N/A | Might add DeepProbLog integration |

**Word Count**: 398

The program successfully meets its core requirements for classical population density comparison. While robust for its current scope, it could be enhanced with probabilistic elements or neural network integration for more sophisticated analysis.
