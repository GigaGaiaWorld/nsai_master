# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must adhere to three key requirements: proper digit constraints, unique digit assignments, and correct arithmetic with carry propagation. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, tests results, and compliance with ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 10 successful solutions with probability 1.0000:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies:
1. First-digit constraints via `leftdigit/1`
2. Unique digit assignments via `all_different/1`
3. Correct arithmetic via `sumdigit/5` with carry propagation

## Failure Localization
Not applicable - All test cases passed successfully. The implementation correctly handles:
- Digit constraints (lines 1-10)
- First-digit validation (line 12)
- Unique assignments (lines 14-18)
- Arithmetic operations (lines 20-24)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness**: The solution correctly models the puzzle constraints:
   ```prolog
   sumdigit(Cin, A, B, Sum, Cout) :- 
     X is Cin + A + B,
     ( X < 10, Sum = X, Cout = 0 ; X >= 10, Sum is X - 10, Cout = 1 ).
   ```
   handles both carry and non-carry scenarios.

2. **Recursive Termination**: `all_different/1` terminates properly as list size decreases recursively.

**Probabilistic Analysis**: 
- No probabilistic facts were used (pure logical solution)
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. **Digit Constraints**: Fully enforced via `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`
2. **Unique Assignments**: Correctly implemented via `all_different/1`
3. **Arithmetic**: Proper carry handling in `sumdigit/5`

**Edge Cases Verified:**
1. First-digit zero prevention works (`A,B,C â‰  0`)
2. All-digit uniqueness prevents invalid assignments
3. Carry propagation handles both single and double-digit sums

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add probabilistic constraints for uncertain digit assignments
2. Include neural network integration for learning digit patterns (DeepProbLog)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Consider adding probabilistic constraints |
| 2 | None | None | DeepProbLog integration possible |
| 3 | None | None | Add test for invalid first-digit zero |

The implementation correctly solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle with proper constraints and arithmetic handling. While currently using pure logical ProbLog, it provides a solid foundation for probabilistic or neural network extensions.
