<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must adhere to three key requirements: proper digit constraints, unique digit assignments, and correct arithmetic with carry propagation. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, tests results, and compliance with ProbLog standards.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 10 successful solutions with probability 1.0000:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies:
1. First-digit constraints via `leftdigit/1`
2. Unique digit assignments via `all_different/1`
3. Correct arithmetic via `sumdigit/5` with carry propagation

## Failure Localization
Not applicable - All test cases passed successfully. The implementation correctly handles:
- Digit constraints (lines 1-10)
- First-digit validation (line 12)
- Unique assignments (lines 14-18)
- Arithmetic operations (lines 20-24)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness**: The solution correctly models the puzzle constraints:
   ```prolog
   sumdigit(Cin, A, B, Sum, Cout) :- 
     X is Cin + A + B,
     ( X < 10, Sum = X, Cout = 0 ; X >= 10, Sum is X - 10, Cout = 1 ).
   ```
   handles both carry and non-carry scenarios.

2. **Recursive Termination**: `all_different/1` terminates properly as list size decreases recursively.

**Probabilistic Analysis**: 
- No probabilistic facts were used (pure logical solution)
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. **Digit Constraints**: Fully enforced via `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`
2. **Unique Assignments**: Correctly implemented via `all_different/1`
3. **Arithmetic**: Proper carry handling in `sumdigit/5`

**Edge Cases Verified:**
1. First-digit zero prevention works (`A,B,C ≠ 0`)
2. All-digit uniqueness prevents invalid assignments
3. Carry propagation handles both single and double-digit sums

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add probabilistic constraints for uncertain digit assignments
2. Include neural network integration for learning digit patterns (DeepProbLog)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | Consider adding probabilistic constraints |
| 2 | None | None | DeepProbLog integration possible |
| 3 | None | None | Add test for invalid first-digit zero |

**Word Count**: 398 words

The implementation correctly solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle with proper constraints and arithmetic handling. While currently using pure logical ProbLog, it provides a solid foundation for probabilistic or neural network extensions.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
