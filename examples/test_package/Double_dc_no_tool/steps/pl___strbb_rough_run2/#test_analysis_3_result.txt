# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to model two string properties: palindrome generation and detecting adjacent 'b' characters. The program consists of probabilistic facts and recursive rules to analyze strings of length N.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with a `CallModeError` during evaluation. The error occurred when calling the `between/3` predicate with invalid argument types. No successful queries were executed due to this fatal error.

## Failure Localization
**Failed Query:** `bb(X) :- len(X)`
- **Error Location:** Line 21 (in the `bb(N)` definition)
- **Problematic Predicate:** `between(1, N-1, I)`
- **Error Type:** CallModeError - invalid argument types
- **Actual vs Expected:**
  - Actual arguments: (1, 5-1, X1)
  - Expected: (integer, integer, integer) or (integer, integer, var)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
   - The recursive `palindrome` rules are logically correct with proper base cases (A > B and N=N) and recursive case (A < B)
   - Recursive termination is properly handled by the base cases

2. **Probabilistic Analysis:**
   - The probabilistic facts `0.5::pick(N,a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b)` correctly model character selection
   - Probability computations would follow standard rules if the program executed

3. **DeepProbLog Check:**
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used" (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (palindrome rules work, but bb/1 fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not properly tested due to error
   - Neural integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The arithmetic expression `N-1` in `between/3` isn't properly evaluated before the call
   - No handling of non-integer or negative inputs
   - No performance issues observed (program didn't complete)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid between/3 arguments | Program fails to execute | Evaluate arithmetic before calling between/3 |
| 2 | Uninstantiated variable in between/3 | Type error | Ensure all arguments are properly instantiated |

**Corrected Code Suggestion:**
```prolog
bb(N) :- 
    Len is N-1, 
    between(1, Len, I), 
    pick(I, b), 
    pick(I+1, b).
```

The main issue stems from improper handling of arithmetic in the `between/3` call. The program shows correct structure for probabilistic string generation but fails during execution due to this technical error. Fixing the argument evaluation in `bb/1` should resolve the immediate problem and allow proper testing of both probabilistic string generation properties.
