# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system models actuator selection, wind effects, and flap position control with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify the correctness of both classical and probabilistic reasoning in the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following probability distributions:

**Goal Reached Probabilities:**
- goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
- goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
- goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
- goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
- goal_reached(5) = 0.0570

**Overrun Exception Probabilities:**
- overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
- overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
- overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
- overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
- overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The results show logically consistent probability distributions that decrease for goal_reached over time while showing minimal overrun exceptions.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Legal flap position checks (`legal_flap_position/1`)
2. Actuator selection probabilities (`use_actuator/2`)
3. Wind effect distributions (`wind_effect/2`)
4. Goal condition verification (`goal_reached/1`)
5. Overrun exception handling (`overrun_exception/1`)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection follows the specified 50/50 distribution
2. Wind effects properly condition on weak/strong wind probabilities
3. The negation in `overrun_exception` correctly implements `P(Â¬legal_position) = 1 - P(legal_position)`
4. All implications maintain proper probabilistic relationships

Key observations:
```prolog
% Correct probabilistic negation in overrun_exception
overrun_exception(Time) :- Time > 0, attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos), \+ legal_flap_position(Pos).

% Proper conditional probability for wind effects
0.25::wind_effect(T,-1); 0.5::wind_effect(T,0); 0.25::wind_effect(T,1) :- wind(weak).
```

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Correctly handles position updates and goal checking
- Probabilistic reasoning: Properly models actuator selection and wind effects
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used (not required)

**Edge Cases Verified:**
1. Initial position (Time=0) is properly handled
2. Boundary positions (0 and 10) are correctly checked
3. Negative time values are excluded by `Time > 0` guards
4. Recursion terminates properly via time bounds (`at(5)`)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic modeling of a safety-critical control system with appropriate handling of edge cases and proper probability distributions. The decreasing probability of reaching the goal over time reflects the accumulating uncertainty in the system's behavior.
