# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning aspects. The code defines move relationships, win/lose conditions, and scoring mechanisms to determine game outcomes between two players.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate implementation. The problematic code appears around line 41 where there's an incomplete or malformed predicate definition. The specific issues are:
1. The predicate is declared twice (lines 41 and the following block)
2. There's a syntax error in the arrow operator `->` usage
3. The predicate body appears incomplete in the first declaration

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The core game logic (move/1, beats/2, result/3) is correctly implemented
2. **Recursive Termination**: The play/3 and compute_score/2 predicates have proper base cases
3. **Syntax Error**: The malformed `determine_winner` predicate prevents proper execution

The probabilistic aspects are not utilized in this implementation (no probabilistic facts or rules), so probabilistic rules don't apply here. DeepProbLog features are not used.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but main predicate fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases:**
1. Non-list inputs aren't handled
2. Uneven move lists could cause issues
3. Invalid moves would fail silently
4. Deep recursion isn't a concern for typical game lengths

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Malformed determine_winner predicate | Complete failure | Fix predicate syntax and remove duplicate declaration |
| 2 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation for input lists |
| 3 | No probabilistic elements | Limited functionality | Consider adding move probabilities if needed |

**Corrected determine_winner predicate:**
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = player1; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = player2; 
     Winner = draw).
```

The core game logic is sound, but the main interface predicate needs correction to make the program fully functional. Once fixed, this implementation would correctly evaluate rock-paper-scissors matches.
