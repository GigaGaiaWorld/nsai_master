# Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of a rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The code should correctly calculate round results and determine the overall winner.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## 3. Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate due to:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (missing closing period)
2. Malformed if-then-else construct in the original code
3. The correct implementation (shown in the `<Langda>` block) wasn't properly integrated

Error location: Line 41, character 77

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues are:
1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate definition was incomplete and contained malformed Prolog syntax
2. **Implementation Discrepancy**: The correct implementation (hashed 4E6CE90A) wasn't properly incorporated into the main code
3. **Classical Logic**: The game logic itself is sound (beats/2 and result/3 are correctly defined)
4. **Recursion**: Both play/3 and compute_score/2 have proper base cases and recursive steps

Probabilistic aspects weren't used in this implementation. DeepProbLog features were not utilized.

## 5. Overall Analysis
The code meets the functional requirements for classical reasoning when properly implemented:
- Correctly defines move relationships (beats/2)
- Properly calculates round results (result/3)
- Correctly implements game simulation (play/3)
- Properly scores results (compute_score/2)

Edge cases to consider:
1. Unequal move list lengths (currently unhandled)
2. Invalid moves (currently unhandled)
3. Empty move lists (handled correctly)

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Code won't compile | Add missing period and proper if-then-else syntax |
| 2 | Implementation not integrated | Incorrect functionality | Use the correct implementation from the Langda block |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation before processing |

## Corrected Implementation
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

The corrected implementation should work as expected, producing the proper winner based on the move sequences. For the test case `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`, it would correctly return `Winner = 'Player 2'` since Player 2 wins two rounds and loses one.
