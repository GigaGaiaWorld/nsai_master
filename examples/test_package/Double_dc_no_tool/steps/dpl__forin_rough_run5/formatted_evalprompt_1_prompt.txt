</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against functional requirements and analyze its behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation correctly handles:
- Base case (empty list)
- Recursive case (non-empty list)
- Insertion operation with proper element placement

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` is correct (Line 1)
   - The recursive case properly splits the list and reassembles it sorted (Lines 2-3)
   - The `insert/3` predicate correctly places elements in order (Lines 4-8)

2. **Termination:**
   - Recursion terminates as the list shrinks with each recursive call
   - All clauses are mutually exclusive and exhaustive

**ProbLog Analysis:**
- The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- ❌ Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (deterministic implementation)
- ❌ Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list input:** Would fail (no type checking)
2. **Mixed elements:** Would work if all elements are comparable
3. **Performance:** O(n²) time complexity as expected for insertion sort
4. **Large lists:** May cause stack overflow due to deep recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No probabilistic features used | Limited to deterministic sorting | Consider adding probabilistic elements if needed |
| 2 | No type checking | May fail with non-list input | Add input validation |
| 3 | Deep recursion risk | Potential stack overflow | Consider iterative approach for large lists |

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation correctly performs insertion sort in classical Prolog but doesn't utilize any probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. For a pure sorting algorithm, it meets its basic requirements effectively.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
