# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against functional requirements and analyze its behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation correctly handles:
- Base case (empty list)
- Recursive case (non-empty list)
- Insertion operation with proper element placement

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` is correct (Line 1)
   - The recursive case properly splits the list and reassembles it sorted (Lines 2-3)
   - The `insert/3` predicate correctly places elements in order (Lines 4-8)

2. **Termination:**
   - Recursion terminates as the list shrinks with each recursive call
   - All clauses are mutually exclusive and exhaustive

**ProbLog Analysis:**
- The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- ❌ Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (deterministic implementation)
- ❌ Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list input:** Would fail (no type checking)
2. **Mixed elements:** Would work if all elements are comparable
3. **Performance:** O(n²) time complexity as expected for insertion sort
4. **Large lists:** May cause stack overflow due to deep recursion

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No probabilistic features used | Limited to deterministic sorting | Consider adding probabilistic elements if needed |
| 2 | No type checking | May fail with non-list input | Add input validation |
| 3 | Deep recursion risk | Potential stack overflow | Consider iterative approach for large lists |

**Word Count:** 398

The implementation correctly performs insertion sort in classical Prolog but doesn't utilize any probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. For a pure sorting algorithm, it meets its basic requirements effectively.
