# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that determines the winner between two players based on their move sequences. The implementation includes basic game rules, result calculation, score computation, and winner determination.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed with an error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 44:16
```
No tests passed due to this compilation error.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate implementation. The specific issues are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The predicate definition is incomplete in the main code block (missing body continuation after the :- operator)
2. **Implementation Mismatch**: The correct implementation appears in the `<Langda>` block but isn't properly integrated

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Prolog Issues**:
   - The recursive predicates `play/3` and `compute_score/2` are correctly defined with proper termination conditions
   - The game logic (beats/2 and result/3) is correctly implemented
   - The main predicate `determine_winner/3` fails due to syntax issues

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - The implementation is purely deterministic classical Prolog

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - DeepProbLog features not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but main predicate fails)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
   - Neural network integration: Not applicable

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs would cause type errors
   - Unequal length move lists would cause failure
   - Invalid moves would not be handled

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Compilation fails | Complete the `determine_winner/3` implementation |
| 2 | Implementation mismatch between code blocks | Functionality broken | Use the correct implementation from `<Langda>` block |
| 3 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add move validation and length checking |

```prolog
% Corrected implementation should be:
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

The core game logic is sound, but the implementation requires proper integration of the winner determination predicate. Once corrected, the system should function as intended for valid inputs. Additional validation would improve robustness.
