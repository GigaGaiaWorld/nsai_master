# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of rock-paper-scissors game logic. The code is designed to:
1. Define basic game rules (moves and winning conditions)
2. Compare moves between two players
3. Calculate game results and determine the winner
4. Handle sequences of moves through recursive processing

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
```
Error: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```
The test query was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate implementation (line 41). The issue stems from:
1. Incomplete predicate definition (missing closing period)
2. Malformed conditional logic (improper use of `->` operator)
3. The predicate body appears after a period, making it syntactically invalid

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical Prolog terms:
1. **Logical Structure**: The game rules (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`) are correctly defined
2. **Recursive Processing**: The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates have proper base cases and recursive steps
3. **Termination**: All recursive predicates have proper base cases ensuring termination

The main issue is purely syntactic - the predicate definition is not properly closed before the conditional logic begins.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works, but winner determination fails)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
- Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge Cases:**
1. Empty move lists would work correctly
2. Non-list inputs would cause type errors
3. Uneven move lists would fail silently
4. Invalid moves would cause failures

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Incomplete predicate definition | Critical failure | Add missing period and properly format conditional |
| 2 | Malformed conditional logic | Syntax error | Use proper Prolog if-then-else structure |
| 3 | Predicate body after period | Syntax error | Ensure predicate definitions are contiguous |

**Corrected Code:**
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

The core game logic is sound, but the predicate implementation needs proper syntax correction to function as intended. After fixing the syntax issues, the implementation should correctly handle all valid game scenarios.
