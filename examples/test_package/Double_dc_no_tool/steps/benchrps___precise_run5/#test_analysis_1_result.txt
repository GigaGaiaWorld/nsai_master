# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning aspects. The code defines game rules, calculates round results, computes scores, and determines the overall winner between two players.

## Test Results Summary
The test encountered an error when executing the query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

Error message:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate implementation. The problematic code segment is:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :-
```

Key issues identified:
1. Typo in predicate name (`determine` vs `determine`)
2. Incomplete implementation (missing body after the head)
3. Line 41 contains malformed syntax (77th character position)

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog scenarios:
1. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented
2. The logical flow for game rules (`beats/2`, `result/3`) is sound
3. The error stems from syntactic issues rather than logical flaws

Probabilistic aspects:
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
- DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are not utilized

## Overall Analysis
Functional requirements:
1. Classical reasoning: Partially met (core game logic works but winner determination fails)
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
3. Neural network integration: Not used

Edge cases consideration:
1. Non-list inputs are not handled
2. Uneven move lists could cause issues
3. Performance with deep recursion untested

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Typo in predicate name | Compilation failure | Correct spelling to `determine_winner` |
| 2 | Incomplete predicate definition | Runtime error | Complete the predicate body |
| 3 | Malformed syntax | Parser error | Fix arrow operator usage |
| 4 | Missing input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for move lists |

The implementation requires correction of syntactic errors and completion of the `determine_winner` predicate to function properly. The core game logic appears sound but remains untested due to these compilation issues.
