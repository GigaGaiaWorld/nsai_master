# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling robot navigation and key pickup scenarios with probabilistic outcomes. The code implements temporal reasoning about robot positions, key carrying states, and slippery key conditions with associated probabilities.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query outcomes:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results are consistent with the defined probabilistic rules and show proper temporal propagation of states.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates function as intended:
1. `at/3` predicates for robot movement (Hash: 87A71821) correctly handle successful/failed moves and stationary cases
2. `at/3` predicates for key position (Hash: 75160384) properly model key movement with robot and stationary behavior
3. `carrying/2` predicates correctly implement pickup and retention logic with probabilistic outcomes

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. Probability complements are correctly handled (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds; 0.3::pickup_fails`)
2. Temporal propagation follows Markovian principles
3. Negation-as-failure is properly implemented in recursive cases
4. Joint probabilities combine correctly (e.g., carrying probability depends on pickup success and retention)

Key probability calculations:
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` combines:
  - Initial pickup success (0.7)
  - Retention probabilities (0.8 for non-slippery, 0.4 for slippery)
  - Initial slippery state (0.5)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional requirements met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Correct state transitions via recursive predicates
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Proper handling of probabilistic facts and their combinations
3. Neural integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge cases handled:**
1. Temporal recursion has proper base cases
2. All negations have defined positive cases
3. Probability distributions are complete (sum to 1.0)

**Potential improvements:**
1. Add explicit checks for impossible positions
2. Consider adding bounds checking for positions
3. Could add visualization predicates for debugging

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |

The implementation correctly models the specified robot navigation and key handling scenario with proper probabilistic reasoning. All test cases produce expected results consistent with the defined probability rules and state transition logic.
