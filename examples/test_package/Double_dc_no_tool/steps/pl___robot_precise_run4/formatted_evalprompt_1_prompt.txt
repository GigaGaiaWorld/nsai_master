<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling robot navigation and key pickup scenarios with probabilistic outcomes. The code implements temporal reasoning about robot positions, key carrying states, and slippery key conditions with associated probabilities.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the following query outcomes:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results are consistent with the defined probabilistic rules and show proper temporal propagation of states.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates function as intended:
1. `at/3` predicates for robot movement (Hash: 87A71821) correctly handle successful/failed moves and stationary cases
2. `at/3` predicates for key position (Hash: 75160384) properly model key movement with robot and stationary behavior
3. `carrying/2` predicates correctly implement pickup and retention logic with probabilistic outcomes

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is mathematically sound:
1. Probability complements are correctly handled (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds; 0.3::pickup_fails`)
2. Temporal propagation follows Markovian principles
3. Negation-as-failure is properly implemented in recursive cases
4. Joint probabilities combine correctly (e.g., carrying probability depends on pickup success and retention)

Key probability calculations:
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` combines:
  - Initial pickup success (0.7)
  - Retention probabilities (0.8 for non-slippery, 0.4 for slippery)
  - Initial slippery state (0.5)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional requirements met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Correct state transitions via recursive predicates
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Proper handling of probabilistic facts and their combinations
3. Neural integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

**Edge cases handled:**
1. Temporal recursion has proper base cases
2. All negations have defined positive cases
3. Probability distributions are complete (sum to 1.0)

**Potential improvements:**
1. Add explicit checks for impossible positions
2. Consider adding bounds checking for positions
3. Could add visualization predicates for debugging

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the specified robot navigation and key handling scenario with proper probabilistic reasoning. All test cases produce expected results consistent with the defined probability rules and state transition logic.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
