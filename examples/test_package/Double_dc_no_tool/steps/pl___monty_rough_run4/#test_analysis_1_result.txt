# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a player selects a door, the host opens another door revealing no prize, and the player decides whether to keep their initial choice or switch. The purpose is to verify correct probabilistic reasoning and adherence to the problem's requirements.

## Test Results Summary
All queries returned expected probability values:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```
**All tests passed (no failures)**.
The results correctly show:
1. Uniform prize distribution (1/3 for each door)
2. Fixed initial selection (door 1)
3. 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 chance of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The `open_door/1` predicate correctly implements both required scenarios:
1. When two non-prize, non-selected doors exist (lines 6-8), it opens one uniformly at random (50% probability)
2. When only one such door exists (implicit in the logic), it must open that door

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly handles:
- **Logical correctness**: The `findall` collects valid doors to open, and `length` check ensures proper branching
- **Probabilistic rules**: The 0.5 probability for two-door case correctly implements uniform random choice
- **Negation**: `\+ prize(X)` and `X \= Selected` properly exclude invalid doors
- **Termination**: The recursive `member/2` predicate has proper base and recursive cases

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network integration appears in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets functional requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models game rules through logical predicates
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes probabilities for both keeping and switching strategies

Edge cases handled correctly:
- Always exactly one valid door to open when player initially selects prize door
- Exactly two valid doors when player initially selects non-prize door
- Fixed initial selection prevents undefined behavior

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic behavior with proper handling of all edge cases. No modifications are required.
