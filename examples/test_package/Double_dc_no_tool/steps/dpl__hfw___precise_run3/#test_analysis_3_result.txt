# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from image identifiers, converts them to symbols, then parses the expression using recursive rules with floating-point comparison tolerance.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
- Query: `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)`
- Error: CallModeError for `</2` due to non-ground arguments in `almost_equal/2`

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `almost_equal/2` predicate when processing complex expressions:
1. **Error Location**: Line 24 (in parse rules for operations)
2. **Failing Predicate**: `almost_equal(R, N1 * R1)` in multiplication case
3. **Root Cause**: The `abs/1` operation in `almost_equal/2` requires ground terms, but receives uninstantiated variables during recursive parsing

## Root Cause Analysis
The logical flow fails because:
1. The recursive parsing tries to evaluate `almost_equal` before fully instantiating variables
2. Classical Prolog evaluation order processes `almost_equal` checks too early
3. The error manifests when comparing unbound variable `R` with arithmetic expression `N1 * R1`
4. ProbLog's strict groundness checking for arithmetic operations triggers the error

Key problematic pattern:
```prolog
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
 ground(Y),  % Fails when Y is arithmetic expression with variables
 abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
```

## Overall Analysis
### Functional Requirements
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met - basic number detection works but expression evaluation fails
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts/rules)
3. **Neural Integration**: Not used (image detection is mocked via deterministic facts)

### Edge Cases
1. **Non-ground Comparisons**: Current implementation cannot handle intermediate unbound variables
2. **Division by Zero**: Protected but untested due to earlier failure
3. **Expression Complexity**: Recursive evaluation order needs adjustment
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground arithmetic comparison | Expression evaluation fails | Restructure to evaluate before comparison |
| 2 | Early almost_equal checking | Breaks recursive evaluation | Move comparison after full expression evaluation |
| 3 | Strict groundness requirement | Limits evaluation strategy | Use separate evaluation and comparison phases |

## Recommended Fixes
1. Restructure the parse rules to separate evaluation from comparison:
```prolog
parse([N1,*|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R1),
    RVal is N1 * R1,  % Evaluate first
    almost_equal(R, RVal).  % Then compare
```

2. Modify almost_equal to handle unevaluated expressions:
```prolog
almost_equal(X, Y) :-
    ground(Y) -> abs(X - Y) < 0.0001
    ; ground(X) -> abs(X - Y) < 0.0001
    ; Y is float(X).
```

This evaluation reveals the need for careful handling of evaluation order in recursive arithmetic parsing, particularly when combining with floating-point comparison tolerances. The core logic is sound but requires restructuring to accommodate ProbLog's groundness requirements.
