# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The program uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to translate images into symbols, then parses these symbols into arithmetic expressions with `parse/2` and `expression/2` predicates.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
CallModeError: Invalid argument types for call to '</2': arguments: (abs(X1-2*7.0), 0.0001), expected: (ground, ground) at 24:13.
```
The test query was:
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `almost_equal/2` predicate when processing the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`. The specific issues are:

1. **Line 24**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate fails because it attempts to compare non-ground terms using arithmetic comparison operators (`<`) that require ground values.

2. **Evaluation Order**: The parser processes operations left-to-right without proper operator precedence handling, leading to incorrect evaluation order (e.g., `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` should be evaluated as `(2 / (3 + 3)) - (2 * 7)`).

## Root Cause Analysis

### Classical Prolog Issues
1. **Groundness Check**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate doesn't properly handle cases where both arguments are variables or where one is a complex expression.
```prolog
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(Y), 
    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.  % Fails when X is not ground
```

2. **Operator Precedence**: The parser implements strict left-to-right evaluation without accounting for mathematical operator precedence rules.

### ProbLog Considerations
1. The program doesn't use any probabilistic features - it's purely deterministic.
2. DeepProbLog features (neural networks) are not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis

### Requirements Met
- Basic arithmetic expression parsing is partially implemented
- Image-to-symbol translation is correctly defined
- Separate parse rules for each operator exist as required

### Edge Cases Missed
1. Non-ground arithmetic comparisons
2. Operator precedence handling
3. Division by zero protection
4. Input validation (non-list inputs)
5. Empty list handling

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground arithmetic comparison | Query fails | Restructure `almost_equal` to handle expressions |
| 2 | Left-to-right evaluation only | Incorrect results | Implement proper operator precedence |
| 3 | No division by zero check | Potential runtime error | Add validation before division |
| 4 | No input validation | May crash on bad inputs | Add type checking predicates |

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Revised almost_equal/2**:
```prolog
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), ground(Y), 
    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(Y), ground(X), 
    Y is float(X).
```

2. **Operator Precedence Handling**:
```prolog
% Add separate rules for term and factor level parsing
parse(Tokens, Result) :-
    parse_expression(Tokens, Result).

parse_expression([T|Ts], Result) :-
    parse_term([T|Ts], Result).

parse_term(Tokens, Result) :-
    parse_factor(Tokens, R1, Rest),
    parse_term_rest(Rest, R1, Result).
```

3. **Division Validation**:
```prolog
parse([N1,/|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R2),
    R2 =\= 0,  % Check for division by zero
    almost_equal(R, N1 / R2).
```
