# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to convert image identifiers into mathematical symbols, then parses and evaluates the resulting expression with `almost_equal/2` handling floating-point comparisons.

## Test Results Summary
The test case evaluates the expression "2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7":
```prolog
query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, 
      image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
```
**Result:** The query returns X = 0.0000, which is incorrect. The expected result should be approximately -13.6667 (2/6 - 14).

## Failure Localization
1. **Main Issue**: The parser fails to handle operator precedence correctly
   - Affected predicates: `parse/2` (all operation cases)
   - The current implementation evaluates operations strictly left-to-right without considering precedence rules

2. **Missing Cases**: The parser is incomplete with only addition defined
   - Missing predicates for subtraction, multiplication, and division
   - Code block hash DA5E8955 only includes the addition case

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**:
   - The parser lacks proper handling of arithmetic precedence (PEMDAS rules)
   - Recursive structure only processes left-to-right without grouping
   - Missing cases for three operators (-, *, /)

2. **Numerical Handling**:
   - `almost_equal/2` is correctly implemented for floating-point comparison
   - The numerical computation itself is incorrect due to precedence issues

3. **DeepProbLog Integration**:
   - DeepProbLog features not used (no neural network calls)
   - Pure symbolic processing with image-to-symbol mapping

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Basic parsing structure exists but incomplete
   - Probabilistic reasoning not utilized (all facts are deterministic)
   - Neural network integration not required/implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling for malformed expressions
   - No input validation for non-list structures
   - No protection against division by zero
   - Deep recursion could occur with long expressions

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing operator cases | 3/4 operators unimplemented | Add parse cases for -, *, / |
| 2 | No precedence handling | Incorrect evaluation | Implement term rewriting or precedence parsing |
| 3 | No error handling | Crashes on invalid input | Add input validation |
| 4 | No grouping support | Can't handle parentheses | Add parenthetical expression support |

**Critical Issue**: The system fundamentally fails to evaluate expressions correctly due to missing operator implementations and lack of precedence handling. The test case demonstrates incorrect evaluation (0.0 vs expected -13.6667).

**Recommendation**: Implement full operator set with proper precedence handling, either through:
1. Explicit precedence levels in parse rules, or
2. Term rewriting to normalized form before evaluation

The current implementation shows promise in the image-to-symbol mapping but requires significant work on the expression evaluation component to be functionally correct.
