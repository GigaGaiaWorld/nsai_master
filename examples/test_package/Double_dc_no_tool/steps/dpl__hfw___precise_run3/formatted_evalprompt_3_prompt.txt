</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from image identifiers, converts them to symbols, then parses the expression using recursive rules with floating-point comparison tolerance.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
- Query: `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)`
- Error: CallModeError for `</2` due to non-ground arguments in `almost_equal/2`

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `almost_equal/2` predicate when processing complex expressions:
1. **Error Location**: Line 24 (in parse rules for operations)
2. **Failing Predicate**: `almost_equal(R, N1 * R1)` in multiplication case
3. **Root Cause**: The `abs/1` operation in `almost_equal/2` requires ground terms, but receives uninstantiated variables during recursive parsing

## Root Cause Analysis
The logical flow fails because:
1. The recursive parsing tries to evaluate `almost_equal` before fully instantiating variables
2. Classical Prolog evaluation order processes `almost_equal` checks too early
3. The error manifests when comparing unbound variable `R` with arithmetic expression `N1 * R1`
4. ProbLog's strict groundness checking for arithmetic operations triggers the error

Key problematic pattern:
```prolog
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
 ground(Y),  % Fails when Y is arithmetic expression with variables
 abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
```

## Overall Analysis
### Functional Requirements
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met - basic number detection works but expression evaluation fails
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts/rules)
3. **Neural Integration**: Not used (image detection is mocked via deterministic facts)

### Edge Cases
1. **Non-ground Comparisons**: Current implementation cannot handle intermediate unbound variables
2. **Division by Zero**: Protected but untested due to earlier failure
3. **Expression Complexity**: Recursive evaluation order needs adjustment
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground arithmetic comparison | Expression evaluation fails | Restructure to evaluate before comparison |
| 2 | Early almost_equal checking | Breaks recursive evaluation | Move comparison after full expression evaluation |
| 3 | Strict groundness requirement | Limits evaluation strategy | Use separate evaluation and comparison phases |

## Recommended Fixes
1. Restructure the parse rules to separate evaluation from comparison:
```prolog
parse([N1,*|T], R) :-
    parse(T, R1),
    RVal is N1 * R1,  % Evaluate first
    almost_equal(R, RVal).  % Then compare
```

2. Modify almost_equal to handle unevaluated expressions:
```prolog
almost_equal(X, Y) :-
    ground(Y) -> abs(X - Y) < 0.0001
    ; ground(X) -> abs(X - Y) < 0.0001
    ; Y is float(X).
```

This evaluation reveals the need for careful handling of evaluation order in recursive arithmetic parsing, particularly when combining with floating-point comparison tolerances. The core logic is sound but requires restructuring to accommodate ProbLog's groundness requirements.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
