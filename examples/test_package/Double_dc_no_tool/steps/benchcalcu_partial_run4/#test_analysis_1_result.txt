# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle where a 2-digit number (AB) is added to a 3-digit number (BCD) to produce another 3-digit number (CDE). The solution must satisfy digit uniqueness constraints and standard addition rules.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 10 successful solutions:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies:
1. First-digit constraints (non-zero)
2. Digit uniqueness
3. Correct column-wise addition with carry propagation
4. Final carry must be zero

## Failure Localization
No failures detected in the test results. All code blocks with their respective hashes performed as expected:
- `F91C6038`: Correctly enforced non-zero first digits
- `A8860BE4`: Properly computed units digit addition
- `702CD838`: Correctly handled tens digit with carry
- `57FD427B`: Successfully managed hundreds digit and final carry
- `0DE8749E`: Ensured all digits are unique

## Root Cause Analysis
The classical Problog implementation demonstrates:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The `sumdigit/5` predicate correctly models addition with carry propagation, handling both cases (sum < 10 and sum â‰¥ 10)
2. **Termination**: Recursive predicates (`all_different/1`, `member/2`) properly terminate due to decreasing list length
3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: All solutions meet the puzzle's requirements through systematic constraint checking

Probabilistic aspects:
- The program uses classical reasoning only (probability 1.0000 for all solutions)
- No probabilistic facts or rules are present
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning fully implemented
- Probabilistic reasoning not required/used
- Neural network integration not utilized

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. The solution handles zero/non-zero digit constraints properly
2. List inputs are properly validated through digit/1 and leftdigit/1 predicates
3. Recursion depth is limited (max 5 digits) so performance isn't impacted
4. No undefined predicates or expansion rules needed

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The implementation correctly solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle with all constraints properly enforced. No modifications are needed for the current requirements. For extended functionality, probabilistic facts or neural network integration could be considered in future versions.
