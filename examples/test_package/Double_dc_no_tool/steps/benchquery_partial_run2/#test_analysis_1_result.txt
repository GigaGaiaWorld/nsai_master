# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population density from given population and area data, then finds country pairs where one density is slightly higher than another (within a 5% margin).

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 successful query results:
```
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All returned results correctly identify country pairs where the first country's density is slightly higher than the second (D1 > D2) but within the specified 5% margin (20*D1 < 21*D2).

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The program correctly implements:
1. Density calculation via `density/2` predicate
2. Comparative query logic in `query_pop/1`
3. All population and area facts are properly defined

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The density calculation `D is (P*100)//A` properly scales the result, and the comparison logic in `query_pop/1` correctly implements the 5% margin requirement.

2. **Termination**: The program terminates as it uses finite facts and non-recursive rules.

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: Pure Prolog (no probabilistic facts or rules) - all results show probability 1.0000 as expected.

4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this program.

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented for population density comparison
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required/implemented
- Neural network integration: Not required/implemented

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. The integer division in density calculation could lead to rounding errors, but this is acceptable for the approximate comparison being made.
2. All input data is properly defined - no missing population/area pairs.
3. The comparison logic handles the edge case where D1 is exactly 5% greater than D2 (though this specific case doesn't appear in the test results).

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

The program correctly implements its specified functionality with no errors detected. For extended use, consider:
1. Adding more countries to the database
2. Implementing floating-point division for more precise density calculations
3. Adding input validation if the program will accept user-provided country names
