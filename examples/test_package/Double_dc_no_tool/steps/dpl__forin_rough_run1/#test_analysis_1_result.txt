# Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify its correctness in classical Prolog terms, check test results, and analyze potential edge cases. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and handling of basic list operations.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```

**Result:**
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly sorts the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation handles:
1. Base case (empty list) - Line 1
2. Recursive case with insertion - Lines 2-3
3. Element insertion rules - Lines 4-7

All predicates are correctly defined without probabilistic or DeepProbLog extensions.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Logical Correctness:**
- The recursion terminates properly (empty list base case)
- The `insert/3` predicate correctly places elements in order through:
  - Direct insertion when empty (Line 4)
  - Prepend when X ≤ Y (Line 5)
  - Recursive insertion when X > Y (Lines 6-7)

**Probabilistic Aspects:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used (pure classical Prolog)
- DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Classical reasoning: Fully functional insertion sort
- ❌ Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable
- ❌ Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list input:** Would fail (no type checking)
2. **Deep recursion:** No stack protection for very long lists
3. **Mixed elements:** Depends on `=</2` working across types
4. **Duplicate values:** Handled correctly via `=<` comparison

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on non-lists | Add type checking |
| 2 | No stack overflow protection | May fail on large lists | Implement tail recursion |
| 3 | No probabilistic extension | Limited to classical logic | Add probabilistic facts if needed |

**Word count:** 398

The implementation correctly performs insertion sort for valid list inputs but lacks robustness for edge cases. For pure classical Prolog requirements, it fully meets expectations with proper recursive logic and termination.
