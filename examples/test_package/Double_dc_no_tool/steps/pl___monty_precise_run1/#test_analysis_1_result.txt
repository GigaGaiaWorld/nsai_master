# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant must choose between keeping their initial door selection or switching after the host reveals an empty door. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning and logical correctness of the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform probability distribution for the prize location (1/3 each)
2. Fixed initial selection of door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
- The probabilistic distribution of prizes (lines 1-2)
- Door selection logic (line 3)
- Host behavior rules (two code blocks for open_door)
- Winning condition definitions (win_keep and win_switch)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. **Prize distribution**: `1/3::prize(X)` properly models uniform probability
2. **Negation handling**: `\+ prize(A)` correctly implements P(Â¬A) = 1-P(A)
3. **Host behavior**:
   - When two empty doors available: random selection (50/50)
   - When one empty door: deterministic selection
4. **Winning conditions**:
   - `win_keep`: matches initial selection probability (1/3)
   - `win_switch`: correctly computes 2/3 probability by excluding opened doors

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct logical rules for door selection and host behavior
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurate probability computations throughout
- **Edge cases**: Proper handling of all door selection scenarios (1, 2, or 3 empty doors)

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | - |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with proper probabilistic reasoning and logical constraints. All test cases pass with expected probabilities, demonstrating a sound understanding of both the problem domain and ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning capabilities.
