</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant must choose between keeping their initial door selection or switching after the host reveals an empty door. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning and logical correctness of the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform probability distribution for the prize location (1/3 each)
2. Fixed initial selection of door 1
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
- The probabilistic distribution of prizes (lines 1-2)
- Door selection logic (line 3)
- Host behavior rules (two code blocks for open_door)
- Winning condition definitions (win_keep and win_switch)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. **Prize distribution**: `1/3::prize(X)` properly models uniform probability
2. **Negation handling**: `\+ prize(A)` correctly implements P(¬A) = 1-P(A)
3. **Host behavior**:
   - When two empty doors available: random selection (50/50)
   - When one empty door: deterministic selection
4. **Winning conditions**:
   - `win_keep`: matches initial selection probability (1/3)
   - `win_switch`: correctly computes 2/3 probability by excluding opened doors

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct logical rules for door selection and host behavior
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurate probability computations throughout
- **Edge cases**: Proper handling of all door selection scenarios (1, 2, or 3 empty doors)

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | - |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with proper probabilistic reasoning and logical constraints. All test cases pass with expected probabilities, demonstrating a sound understanding of both the problem domain and ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning capabilities.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
