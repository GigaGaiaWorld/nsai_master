</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, then evaluates the resulting mathematical expressions. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog functionality with arithmetic operations, particularly checking the recursive parsing implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` failed with a CallModeError. The error occurs when comparing floating-point results using the `almost_equal/2` predicate.

## Failure Localization
The failure occurs in the `almost_equal/2` predicate (line 23) when processing division operations. The error message indicates the comparison `abs(X - Y) < 0.0001` failed because one argument wasn't ground when it needed both arguments to be ground values.

Key problematic components:
1. `almost_equal/2` implementation (lines 21-24)
2. Division operation handling in `parse/2` (FB41E2F7 code block, line 4)
3. Recursive parsing of compound expressions (FB41E2F7 code block, line 7)

## Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue stems from Prolog's evaluation order and the `ground/1` check in `almost_equal/2`:
1. When evaluating `2/3 + 3 - 2*7`, the system first tries to compute `2/3`
2. The division creates a non-ground floating-point result
3. `almost_equal/2` attempts to compare this non-ground result with `0.0001` before full evaluation
4. Prolog's built-in `</2` requires both arguments to be ground numbers

The classical recursion logic is otherwise correct, but the arithmetic comparison implementation needs modification to handle intermediate non-ground results.

## Overall Analysis
The code meets basic functional requirements for:
- Classical arithmetic expression parsing
- Recursive evaluation of compound expressions
- Image-to-symbol translation

Edge cases not properly handled:
- Non-ground arithmetic comparisons
- Division by zero protection
- Input validation for non-list structures
- Deep recursion performance (though not tested here)

DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground arithmetic comparison in almost_equal/2 | Prevents evaluation of division operations | Restructure to evaluate fully before comparison |
| 2 | Missing input validation | May crash on malformed inputs | Add type checking for input lists |
| 3 | No division by zero protection | Potential runtime error | Add guard condition for division |
| 4 | Strict ground check in comparison | Limits expression evaluation | Implement lazy evaluation strategy |

```prolog
% Suggested fix for almost_equal/2
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    float(X), float(Y), 
    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(Y), 
    Y is float(X).
```

The evaluation reveals a need for more robust arithmetic handling while confirming the core parsing logic is structurally sound. The solution requires modifying the comparison predicate to accommodate intermediate non-ground results during expression evaluation.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
