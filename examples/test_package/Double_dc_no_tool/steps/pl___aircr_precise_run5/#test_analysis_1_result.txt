# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries executed successfully with the following probability distributions:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results show consistent probability distributions that properly account for all modeled scenarios (actuator selection, wind effects, and position constraints).

## Failure Localization
No test failures occurred. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Goal checking via `goal_reached/1` predicate
2. Actuator selection through probabilistic facts `use_actuator/2`
3. Wind effect calculations via `wind_effect/2`
4. Position validation with `legal_flap_position/1`

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic computations are mathematically sound:
1. Actuator selection probabilities sum to 1 (0.5::a; 0.5::b)
2. Wind effect distributions properly condition on wind strength
3. Position calculations correctly combine actuator thrust and wind effects
4. Probability axioms are maintained (e.g., P(Â¬legal_position) = 1-P(legal_position))

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - The implementation uses only standard ProbLog features without neural network integration.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets all functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**:
   - Correctly models flap position transitions
   - Properly handles edge cases (overrun exceptions)
   - Terminates recursion through time bounds

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
   - Accurately combines probabilities from multiple sources
   - Maintains proper probability distributions
   - Correctly handles conditional probabilities

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Initial position (Time=0) properly excluded from updates
   - Overrun detection works for all boundary positions (0 and 10)
   - Wind effects properly constrained to legal ranges

## Error Summary
