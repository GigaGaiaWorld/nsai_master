# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on classical reasoning aspects. The code defines game rules, result calculation, and score computation to determine the winner between two players.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 as the winner with 100% probability, which matches expected behavior since player2 wins 2 out of 3 rounds (rock vs paper = lose, rock vs paper = lose, rock vs scissor = win).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates are correctly defined:
- Basic moves (`move/1`) for rock, paper, scissor
- Win conditions (`beats/2`) for all combinations
- Result calculation (`result/3`) covering win/lose/draw cases
- Score computation (`compute_score/2`) handling all result types
- Game simulation (`play/3`) and winner determination (`determine_winner/3`)

## Root Cause Analysis
The classical Problog implementation shows correct logical behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All rules properly implement game semantics
2. **Recursive Termination**: Base cases exist for both `play/3` and `compute_score/2`
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: Not heavily used (only deterministic facts), but correctly implemented
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used in this implementation

Key correct behaviors:
```prolog
% Correct recursive termination
play([], [], []).
compute_score([], 0).

% Proper score accumulation
compute_score([win|Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose|Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw|Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S).
```

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning fully implemented
- Basic game logic correctly encoded
- Score calculation and winner determination working

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty input lists handled by base cases
2. All move combinations covered by `beats/2`
3. Draw conditions properly checked

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for move types
2. Consider probabilistic versions of moves
3. Add tie-breaking mechanisms

The implementation correctly models the rock-paper-scissors game with proper handling of all game scenarios. While currently limited to deterministic play, the foundation exists for potential probabilistic extensions.
