# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines game rules, calculates match results between two players, and determines the overall winner. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test case coverage, and proper implementation of game mechanics.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 winning with 3 rounds (2 wins for player2 and 1 win for player1).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. All predicates are correctly defined:
- `move/1` correctly defines all three gestures (rock, paper, scissor)
- `beats/2` properly implements all win-lose relationships
- `result/3` correctly handles draw, win, and lose scenarios
- `play/3` and `compute_score/2` accurately process move lists and calculate scores
- `determine_winner/3` properly interprets the final score

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog analysis:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All rules follow proper game logic with correct recursive termination (base case `play([],[],[])`).
2. **Probabilistic Aspects**: The implementation uses deterministic facts only (no probabilistic facts), so probabilistic rules don't apply here.
3. **DeepProbLog**: No neural network integration (`nn/3` or `tensor` calls) was used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used".

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully met with correct game implementation
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (deterministic facts only)
- Neural network integration: Not implemented

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty move lists handled by base case
2. All possible gesture combinations covered
3. Score calculation handles all result types (win/lose/draw)
4. Potential issues with non-list inputs not explicitly guarded against

**Improvement Suggestions:**
1. Add input validation for list arguments
2. Consider adding probabilistic versions of moves
3. Add tie-breaking rules for extended games

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on non-list inputs | Add type checking |
| 2 | No probabilistic facts | Limits probabilistic reasoning | Consider adding move probabilities |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Could add learned strategies |

The implementation correctly models the rock-paper-scissors game with proper handling of all basic cases. While functionally correct, it could be enhanced with probabilistic elements and input validation for more robust real-world usage.
