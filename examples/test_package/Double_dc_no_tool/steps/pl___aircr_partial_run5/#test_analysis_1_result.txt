# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under wind effects using probabilistic actuators, with safety checks for legal positions. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability values without errors:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The results show consistent probability distributions that properly account for actuator choices, wind effects, and position legality checks.

## Failure Localization
No test failures occurred. All predicates were verified:
1. `legal_flap_position/1` (Line 2) - Correct range check
2. `use_actuator/2` (Line 5) - Proper probabilistic choice
3. `wind_effect/2` (Lines 7-9) - Correct conditional distributions
4. Core predicates (`flap_position/2`, `overrun_exception/1`, `goal_reached/1`) match their hash-verified implementations

## Root Cause Analysis
### Logical Correctness
- Termination: Recursion bounded by `at(5)` prevents infinite loops
- Position updates correctly follow `attempted_flap_position → legal_flap_position` chain
- Wind effects properly integrate via arithmetic (`Pos is Old + AE + WE`)

### Probabilistic Compliance
- Actuator selection: `P(a)=0.5, P(b)=0.5` satisfies `P(a)+P(b)=1`
- Wind model: Weak/strong distributions properly normalize (0.25+0.5+0.25=1 and 0.2+0.3+0.3+0.2=1)
- Exception handling: `overrun_exception` correctly implements `¬legal_flap_position`

### DeepProbLog Feature
**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network integrations (`nn/3`, `tensor/1`) present.

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Classical reasoning | ✔ (Position updates, goal checks) |
| Probabilistic reasoning | ✔ (Actuators, wind effects) |
| Neural integration | ✖ (Not required) |

### Edge Cases Verified
1. **Boundary Positions**: `legal_flap_position` correctly handles FP=0 and FP=10
2. **Wind Extremes**: Strong wind (±3) properly affects position calculations
3. **Time Bounds**: `at(5)` prevents unbounded recursion
4. **Initial State**: `flap_position(0,6)` correctly initializes system
