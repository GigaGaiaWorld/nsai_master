  "ErrorSummary": "The almost_equal/2 predicate fails when comparing non-ground terms during expression evaluation, particularly with division operations. The error occurs because the predicate assumes Y is ground for comparison.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Revise the almost_equal/2 predicate to handle uninstantiated variables first:\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- \n  var(Y), !, Y = X.\nalmost_equal(X, Y) :- \n  number(X), number(Y), \n  abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.",
