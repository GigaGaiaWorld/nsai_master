    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a probabilistic bias. The program should count successful outcomes (heads) from multiple coin tosses, where each coin has an 80% probability of landing heads. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and proper recursive implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16
```
No queries were successfully executed due to this compilation error. The program failed before reaching any probabilistic calculations or recursive operations.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate (lines 8-16) where an if-then-else construct is improperly formatted. The specific issues are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The if-then-else construct `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` is not properly recognized by ProbLog's parser
2. **Line Reference**: The error points to position 8:16 in the code where the arrow operator `->` is used

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues identified are:

1. **Classical ProbLog Context**:
   - The recursive termination condition `coins_r(SC,SC,0).` is correctly defined
   - The recursive step fails due to improper if-then-else syntax
   - ProbLog requires special handling of conditional statements compared to standard Prolog

2. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - The probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).` is correctly defined
   - The probability calculations never execute due to the syntax error
   - The intended probability rules would correctly compute `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` if the program ran

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used" - no neural network integration present

## Overall Analysis
The program fails to meet its functional requirements due to the syntax error. If corrected, it would properly implement:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Recursive counting of successful outcomes
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: 80% bias probability for each coin toss
3. **Edge Cases**: The current implementation doesn't handle:
   - Negative counter values
   - Non-integer counter values
   - Very deep recursion (performance consideration)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Improper if-then-else syntax | Complete failure | Use `probabilistic_if/3` or proper ProbLog conditional syntax |
| 2 | No error handling for invalid CNT | Potential runtime errors | Add validation for CNT > 0 in recursive case |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT) ->
        NSC is SC + 1
    ;
        NSC is SC
    ),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```
Should be replaced with ProbLog-compatible syntax:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    problog_conditional(coin(CNT), NSC is SC + 1, NSC is SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

The evaluation concludes that while the program's logic is sound, the implementation contains critical syntax errors that prevent execution. Correcting the conditional statement syntax would allow the program to meet its intended functionality.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
