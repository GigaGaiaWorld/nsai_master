    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses and count successes. The program uses recursive counting to tally successful outcomes (heads) from probabilistic coin tosses. The evaluation focuses on correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and error handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12.
```

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the recursive rule `coins_r/3` (lines 7-12) where an invalid implication operator `->` is used. ProbLog doesn't support the standard Prolog implication operator in this context.

Problematic code segment:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 (coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC = SC),  % Line 7, invalid operator
 CNT1 is CNT - 1,
 coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Structure**: The recursive counting logic is conceptually correct but implemented with invalid syntax.
2. **Probabilistic Context**: The program attempts to use probabilistic facts (`coin(C)`) but fails due to syntax errors before probability calculations can occur.
3. **Operator Support**: ProbLog requires different syntax for conditional probability than standard Prolog's `->` operator.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax error
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not achieved due to syntax error
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The base case (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined
   - Recursive depth is controlled by the counter
   - No list handling required in this implementation

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid `->` operator in ProbLog | Complete failure | Replace with `if-then-else` probabilistic syntax |
| 2 | Missing probability specification | Incorrect results | Explicitly define probabilistic outcomes |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog integration | Limited functionality | Consider neural predicates if needed |

## Recommended Fix
Replace the problematic conditional with ProbLog-compatible syntax:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 (coin(CNT), NSC is SC + 1 ; \+coin(CNT), NSC = SC),
 CNT1 is CNT - 1,
 coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

The complete evaluation reveals that while the program's logic is sound, its implementation uses incompatible ProbLog syntax. The primary issue is the use of Prolog's implication operator rather than ProbLog's probabilistic condition handling. Addressing this syntax issue would allow the probabilistic counting to function as intended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
