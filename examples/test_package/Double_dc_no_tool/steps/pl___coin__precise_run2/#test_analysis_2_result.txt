# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a probabilistic bias. The program should count successful outcomes (heads) from multiple coin tosses, where each coin has an 80% probability of landing heads. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and proper recursive implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test execution resulted in a failure with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16
```
No queries were successfully executed due to this compilation error. The program failed before reaching any probabilistic calculations or recursive operations.

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate (lines 8-16) where an if-then-else construct is improperly formatted. The specific issues are:

1. **Syntax Error**: The if-then-else construct `(Condition -> Then ; Else)` is not properly recognized by ProbLog's parser
2. **Line Reference**: The error points to position 8:16 in the code where the arrow operator `->` is used

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues identified are:

1. **Classical ProbLog Context**:
   - The recursive termination condition `coins_r(SC,SC,0).` is correctly defined
   - The recursive step fails due to improper if-then-else syntax
   - ProbLog requires special handling of conditional statements compared to standard Prolog

2. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - The probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).` is correctly defined
   - The probability calculations never execute due to the syntax error
   - The intended probability rules would correctly compute `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` if the program ran

3. **DeepProbLog**:
   - "DeepProbLog feature not used" - no neural network integration present

## Overall Analysis
The program fails to meet its functional requirements due to the syntax error. If corrected, it would properly implement:

1. **Classical Reasoning**: Recursive counting of successful outcomes
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: 80% bias probability for each coin toss
3. **Edge Cases**: The current implementation doesn't handle:
   - Negative counter values
   - Non-integer counter values
   - Very deep recursion (performance consideration)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Improper if-then-else syntax | Complete failure | Use `probabilistic_if/3` or proper ProbLog conditional syntax |
| 2 | No error handling for invalid CNT | Potential runtime errors | Add validation for CNT > 0 in recursive case |

## Corrected Code Suggestion
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(CNT) ->
        NSC is SC + 1
    ;
        NSC is SC
    ),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```
Should be replaced with ProbLog-compatible syntax:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    problog_conditional(coin(CNT), NSC is SC + 1, NSC is SC),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
```

The evaluation concludes that while the program's logic is sound, the implementation contains critical syntax errors that prevent execution. Correcting the conditional statement syntax would allow the program to meet its intended functionality.
