# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation through test cases and analyze its compliance with ProbLog semantics.

## Test Results Summary
All test queries returned the expected results with probability 1.0000:
```
prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob))) = 1.0000
prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 1.0000
prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 1.0000
prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 1.0000
prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All expansion predicates were correctly implemented:
1. `implies/2` (Hash 99C92279): Correctly implements P ⇒ Q as ¬P ∨ Q
2. `opposite/1` (Hash B6292BC0): Correct negation using `\+ prove(P)`
3. `expand/2` (Hash 22D05CCC): Properly delegates to defined expansion rules
4. `includes/2` (Hash 5AFBB985): Correct set inclusion via `member/2`
5. `extend/3` (Hash 62B0CEA4): Proper list extension implementation
6. `refute/1`: Correctly implements unprovability check

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog context:
- Logical correctness verified for all predicates
- Recursive cases (member/2, ancestor/2) properly terminate
- Probabilistic rules comply with:
  - P(¬A) = 1−P(A) via `opposite/1`
  - P(A⇒B) = P(¬A)+P(A∧B) via `implies/2`
  
DeepProbLog features: **DeepProbLog feature not used**

## Overall Analysis
**Functional requirements met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully supported through meta-interpreter
- Probabilistic reasoning: Correct handling of negation and implication
- Neural network integration: Not applicable (no nn/3 or tensor operations)

**Edge case considerations:**
1. Undefined `expand/2` rules would fail (expected behavior)
2. Non-list input to `includes/2` would fail (type safety)
3. Deep recursion could impact performance (no protection)
4. Empty list handling works correctly in `member/2`

The implementation demonstrates correct ProbLog semantics and handles the test cases effectively. For production use, additional type checking and recursion depth limits could be considered.
