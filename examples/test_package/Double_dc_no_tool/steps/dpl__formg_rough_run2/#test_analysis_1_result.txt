# Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the implementation against functional requirements and identify potential edge cases or logical errors.

## Test Results Summary
The provided test case was:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
Result:
```
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly sorted the input list with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected output.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test case. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Base cases (empty list and single-element list)
2. Recursive splitting via `split/3`
3. Merging of sorted sublists via `merge/3`

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Analysis:
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The algorithm follows standard merge sort logic
   - Recursive termination is guaranteed by:
     - Base cases (lines 1-2)
     - Length check before recursion (line 4)
   - The `split/3` predicate correctly divides lists (lines 9-12)
   - The `merge/3` predicate properly handles all comparison cases (lines 13-20)

2. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - The result shows probability 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior
   - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met - correct sorting implementation
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Non-list input would fail (no type checking)
   - Mixed-type elements might cause comparison errors
2. **Performance**:
   - Deep recursion could stack overflow for very large lists
3. **Special Cases**:
   - Already-sorted lists work correctly
   - Reverse-sorted lists work correctly
   - Duplicate elements are handled properly

```prolog
% Correct implementation verified:
merge_sort([], []).
merge_sort([X], [X]).
merge_sort(List, Sorted) :-
    length(List, Len),
    Len > 1,
    split(List, Left, Right),
    merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft),
    merge_sort(Right, SortedRight),
    merge(SortedLeft, SortedRight, Sorted).
```

The implementation is correct for the tested case and appears robust for standard use cases. For production use, additional input validation and performance testing with large datasets would be recommended.
