# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system detects numbers and operators from images, converts them to symbols, then parses the expression using recursive rules with `almost_equal/2` for floating-point comparison.

## Test Results Summary
The test query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` failed with a CallModeError. The error occurs when comparing non-ground arguments in the `almost_equal/2` predicate during expression evaluation.

## Failure Localization
- **Failed Query**: `expression([image_2,...,image_7], X)`
- **Error Location**: Line 24 (in the `almost_equal/2` predicate)
- **Problem**: The `abs(X - Y) < 0.0001` comparison fails when either X or Y is not ground
- **Affected Rules**: All `parse/2` rules that use arithmetic operations (lines 24-39)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Issue**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate attempts to handle both ground and non-ground cases, but the comparison operation requires ground terms
2. **Recursion**: The recursive parsing works correctly structurally, but fails at the comparison step
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: No probabilistic facts or neural network integration is used in this implementation ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning partially works (correct symbol detection but fails at evaluation)
   - Probabilistic reasoning not implemented
   - Neural network integration not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-ground comparisons not handled properly
   - Division by zero not prevented
   - Input validation missing for non-list inputs

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground comparison in almost_equal/2 | Evaluation fails | Restructure to ensure ground terms before comparison |
| 2 | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add type checking for input lists |
| 3 | No division by zero check | Potential arithmetic exception | Add validation before division |

```prolog
% Suggested fix for almost_equal/2
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), ground(Y), 
    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(Y), 
    Y is float(X).
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    var(X), 
    X is float(Y).
```

The main issue stems from attempting arithmetic comparison with uninstantiated variables. The solution requires either:
1. Ensuring all terms are ground before comparison, or
2. Restructuring the evaluation to use the `is/2` operator first before comparison

The evaluation correctly handles the symbolic detection and parsing structure, but fails at the final arithmetic evaluation step due to improper handling of variable instantiation.
