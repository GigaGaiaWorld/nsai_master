# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Arithmetic Expression Parser

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions from image-based inputs. The system uses `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` facts to translate images into mathematical symbols, then evaluates the expressions with proper operator precedence handling.

## Test Results Summary
The evaluation encountered one critical error during testing:
- Query: `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)`
- Error: CallModeError for `</2` due to non-ground arguments in `almost_equal/2`

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the `almost_equal/2` predicate (line 24) when processing complex expressions. The specific issues are:
1. **Location**: Recursive parse operations involving arithmetic expressions
2. **Problematic Rule**: All `parse/2` rules using `almost_equal/2` for result comparison
3. **Line Numbers**: 24-37 (all parse rules with arithmetic operations)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Logical Error**: The `almost_equal/2` predicate requires ground terms for comparison, but receives uninstantiated variables during recursive parsing
2. **Operator Precedence**: The current implementation evaluates operations strictly left-to-right without proper precedence handling (e.g., multiplication before addition)
3. **Error Propagation**: The initial comparison failure prevents proper evaluation of nested expressions

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (fails on complex expressions)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts/rules)
   - Neural integration: Not used (image detection simulated with facts)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling for division by zero in nested expressions
   - No validation for malformed input sequences
   - No support for parentheses or operator precedence

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-ground comparison in almost_equal/2 | Prevents expression evaluation | Restructure to evaluate before comparison |
| 2 | Left-associative evaluation only | Incorrect results for standard arithmetic | Implement operator precedence |
| 3 | No input validation | May fail silently on bad inputs | Add validation predicates |

```prolog
% Suggested fix for almost_equal/2
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    ground(X), ground(Y), 
    abs(X - Y) < 0.0001.
almost_equal(X, Y) :- 
    (var(X); var(Y)), 
    (ground(X) -> Y is float(X) ; X is float(Y)).
```

The evaluation reveals the need for significant restructuring to handle:
1. Proper operator precedence
2. Ground term checking
3. More robust error handling
4. Potential extension to probabilistic evaluation

DeepProbLog features were not utilized in this implementation. The core issue stems from improper handling of recursive evaluation in a purely classical Prolog context.
