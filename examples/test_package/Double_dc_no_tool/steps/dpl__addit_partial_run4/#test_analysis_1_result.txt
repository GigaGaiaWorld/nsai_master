# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Digit Addition Program

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that performs digit recognition and addition operations. The program consists of digit facts (img_1 to img_0) and an addition rule that sums the recognized digits. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation against specified requirements and testing the addition query.

## Test Results Summary
The program was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
```
**Result:**
```
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The addition of digits 5 and 6 correctly returns 11 with full probability (1.0000), matching the expected behavior.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The program successfully:
1. Recognized digit values for all image inputs (img_1 to img_0)
2. Correctly implemented the addition logic
3. Produced accurate probabilistic results for the query

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**
- The digit facts are correctly defined with 1:1 mapping between images and numbers
- The addition rule properly unifies variables and performs arithmetic:
  ```prolog
  addition(X,Y,Z) :- 
      digit(X,A),
      digit(Y,B),
      Z is A + B.
  ```
- The program terminates properly as there is no recursion

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- All facts have implicit probability 1.0 (deterministic)
- The single query returns probability 1.0 as expected for deterministic facts
- No probabilistic operations (negations/implications) were used

**DeepProbLog Verification:**
DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration or tensor operations)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Fully met - correct digit recognition and addition
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Basic requirement met (deterministic case)
3. Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. All digits (0-9) are properly defined
2. The addition handles all combinations of digits
3. No list inputs or complex structures involved

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Could add probabilistic digits (e.g., `0.8::digit(img_x,N)`)
2. Could include input validation
3. Could extend to handle multi-digit numbers

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|

The program correctly implements all specified requirements for digit recognition and addition operations in a deterministic ProbLog context. No errors were found during evaluation.
