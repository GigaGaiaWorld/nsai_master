# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in Prolog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from given population and area data, then finds pairs where one country's density is slightly higher than another's (within a 5% margin).

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 4 successful query results:
1. `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`
2. `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`
3. `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`
4. `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`

**All tests passed (no failures)** - All queries returned valid country pairs with density values that satisfy the program's criteria (D1 > D2 and 20*D1 < 21*D2).

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The program correctly implements:
- Population density calculation (`density/2` predicate)
- Comparative query logic (`query_pop/1` predicate)
- All base facts (`pop/2` and `area/2`) are properly defined

## Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct classical Prolog functionality:
1. **Logical Correctness**:
   - Density calculation: `D is (P*100)//A` correctly computes people per 1000 sq miles
   - Query conditions: `D1 > D2` and `20*D1 < 21*D2` properly implement the 5% margin requirement

2. **Termination**:
   - The program terminates as all predicates are non-recursive and all facts are grounded

3. **Probabilistic Aspects**:
   - Pure classical Prolog program (no probabilistic facts/rules)
   - DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements)
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. The integer division in density calculation could cause precision loss, but this matches the original specification
2. All country pairs are explicitly listed - no undefined cases
3. Input validation not needed as queries are generated by the program

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Floating-point division would provide more precise density values
2. Additional validation could ensure D1 â‰  D2 to avoid trivial matches

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The program correctly implements its specified functionality with no errors detected in the test cases. All requirements are satisfied for this classical Prolog implementation.
