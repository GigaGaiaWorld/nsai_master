# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door, and the contestant decides whether to keep their original choice or switch. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning correctly calculates the 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the original choice and 2/3 chance by switching.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The results correctly match the known probabilities of the Monty Hall problem:
- Equal 1/3 probability for the prize behind each door
- 1/3 probability to win by keeping the original choice
- 2/3 probability to win by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates function as intended:
1. `prize/1` correctly distributes probability equally (lines 1-2)
2. `open_door/1` rules correctly handle both scenarios (lines 5-15)
3. `win_keep` and `win_switch` correctly calculate winning probabilities (lines 16-22)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
1. **Probability Distribution**: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for each door
2. **Negation Handling**: `\+ prize(A)` correctly computes complement probabilities
3. **Conditional Logic**: The two `open_door` cases properly handle:
   - Random selection when both remaining doors are empty (P=0.5)
   - Deterministic selection when one door has a prize
4. **Query Results**: Joint probabilities correctly computed through marginalization

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets functional requirements:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly models game rules through logical predicates
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Accurately computes all required probabilities
3. **Edge Cases**: Handles all door selection combinations properly

Potential improvements:
1. Explicitly list all doors rather than using `member/2` for clarity
2. Add validation for door selection constraints
3. Consider adding visualization of the decision tree

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | Implementation correct |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic reasoning. All test cases pass, demonstrating proper handling of both the classical game mechanics and probabilistic outcomes. No errors or improvements were identified as critical.
