</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The code models a game show scenario where a contestant selects a door, the host opens another door, and the contestant decides whether to keep their original choice or switch. The purpose is to verify the probabilistic reasoning correctly calculates the 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the original choice and 2/3 chance by switching.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

**All tests passed (no failures)**. The results correctly match the known probabilities of the Monty Hall problem:
- Equal 1/3 probability for the prize behind each door
- 1/3 probability to win by keeping the original choice
- 2/3 probability to win by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. All predicates function as intended:
1. `prize/1` correctly distributes probability equally (lines 1-2)
2. `open_door/1` rules correctly handle both scenarios (lines 5-15)
3. `win_keep` and `win_switch` correctly calculate winning probabilities (lines 16-22)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
1. **Probability Distribution**: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for each door
2. **Negation Handling**: `\+ prize(A)` correctly computes complement probabilities
3. **Conditional Logic**: The two `open_door` cases properly handle:
   - Random selection when both remaining doors are empty (P=0.5)
   - Deterministic selection when one door has a prize
4. **Query Results**: Joint probabilities correctly computed through marginalization

DeepProbLog features were not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The code fully meets functional requirements:
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Correctly models game rules through logical predicates
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Accurately computes all required probabilities
3. **Edge Cases**: Handles all door selection combinations properly

Potential improvements:
1. Explicitly list all doors rather than using `member/2` for clarity
2. Add validation for door selection constraints
3. Consider adding visualization of the decision tree

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | Implementation correct |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic reasoning. All test cases pass, demonstrating proper handling of both the classical game mechanics and probabilistic outcomes. No errors or improvements were identified as critical.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
</Final_Answer>
