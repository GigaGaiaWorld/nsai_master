# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling robot navigation and key pickup scenarios with probabilistic outcomes. The code implements temporal reasoning about robot/key positions and pickup/drop probabilities. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities sum correctly (≈1.0 where applicable) and align with expected behavior given the defined probabilistic facts and rules.

## Failure Localization
No test failures detected. All predicates function as intended:
- `at/3` rules (robot movement) correctly handle success/failure cases
- `carrying/2` properly models key pickup/retention
- Probabilistic facts (`pickup_succeeds`, `drop_slippery_key`, etc.) combine correctly

## Root Cause Analysis
### Logical Correctness
- Recursive cases (e.g., `slippery(key,s(T))`) have proper base cases (`slippery(key,0)`)
- Negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used appropriately in all cases
- Temporal progression (`s(T)`) is handled consistently

### Probabilistic Compliance
- All probabilities sum to 1.0 where mutually exclusive:
  - `pickup_succeeds(T) + pickup_fails(T) = 1.0`
  - `drop_slippery_key(T) + holds_slippery_key(T) = 1.0`
- Probability calculations respect:
  - `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` (e.g., `\+do(putdown(key),T)`)
  - Conjunction probabilities multiply appropriately

### DeepProbLog Integration
DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network components present)

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully implemented for robot/key movement logic
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly models stochastic actions (pickup/drop success)
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no `nn/3` or tensor operations)

### Edge Cases Verified
- Initial conditions (`at(key,loc1,0)`, `at(robot,loc0,0)`) properly handled
- Action sequences (`do/2` facts) correctly processed
- Recursive depth limited by finite time steps (`s(s(s(0)))`)

## Error Summary

The implementation correctly models the specified scenario with accurate probabilistic reasoning and proper handling of temporal state changes. All test cases validate expected behavior without discrepancies.
