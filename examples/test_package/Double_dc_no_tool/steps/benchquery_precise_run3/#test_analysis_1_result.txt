# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided population and area data, then finds country pairs where their densities are within 5% of each other (using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations).

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful queries:
```
query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - All queries returned correct country pairs with matching densities within the specified 5% tolerance.

## 3. Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The implementation correctly:
1. Calculates densities using integer arithmetic (`D is (P*100) // A`)
2. Filters country pairs with the 5% tolerance condition (`20*D1 < 21*D2`, `20*D2 < 21*D1`)
3. Avoids duplicate pairs with `C1 @< C2`

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Aspects:
- **Logical Correctness**: The program correctly implements the required logic for density calculation and comparison
- **Termination**: The program terminates properly as it uses finite facts and no recursion
- **Edge Cases**: Handles all provided country data correctly, with integer arithmetic preventing floating-point issues

### ProbLog Aspects:
- The program uses deterministic facts (all probabilities = 1.0000)
- No probabilistic facts or rules were used in this implementation
- No negation or implication operations were required
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully implemented and correct
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not required for this task
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not required for this task

### Edge Cases Considered:
1. **Undefined countries**: Not an issue as all queries use defined countries
2. **Zero area**: Prevented by the provided dataset
3. **Non-list input**: The query format is enforced by the predicate definition
4. **Duplicate pairs**: Prevented by `C1 @< C2` condition

### Code Quality:
- The density calculation (`(P*100) // A`) effectively avoids floating-point operations
- The 5% tolerance check using integer multiplication is clever and efficient
- The hash tags (DE4779C6, 3A3D0149) allow for version tracking

The implementation successfully meets all specified requirements with robust handling of the population density comparison task. The use of integer arithmetic for both density calculation and comparison ensures reliable results without floating-point precision issues.
