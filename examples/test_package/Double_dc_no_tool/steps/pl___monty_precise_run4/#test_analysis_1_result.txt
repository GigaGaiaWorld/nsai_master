# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a game show host reveals one of three doors after the contestant's initial selection. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and ensure the implementation matches the known probability distributions of this problem.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform 1/3 probability for each door hiding the prize
2. Certainty of initial door selection (door 1)
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
- The random prize placement (lines 1-2)
- Door selection (line 3)
- Host behavior rules (lines 5-20)
- Win condition calculations (lines 22-28)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic reasoning:
1. **Prize distribution**: `1/3::prize(X)` facts correctly model uniform distribution
2. **Host behavior**:
   - When two empty doors available (E2FA63E7), host chooses randomly (50/50)
   - When only one empty door available (B4161B21), host chooses it deterministically
3. **Probability calculations**:
   - `P(win_keep) = P(prize(1)) = 1/3` matches theory
   - `P(win_switch) = 2/3` correctly aggregates probabilities of prize being behind other doors
4. **Negation handling**: Proper use of `\+` for negative conditions

DeepProbLog feature not used in this implementation.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct use of logical predicates and negation
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper handling of probabilistic facts and rules
- **Edge cases**: Handles all door selection and prize placement combinations

Key strengths:
1. Clear separation of probabilistic and deterministic rules
2. Proper handling of the host's constrained choices
3. Correct probability aggregation in win conditions

Potential improvements:
1. Could generalize `select_door(1)` to allow any initial selection
2. Could add validation for door numbers being in 1-3 range
