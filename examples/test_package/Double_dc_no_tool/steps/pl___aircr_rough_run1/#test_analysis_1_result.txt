# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under wind effects using probabilistic actuators. The purpose is to verify correct probabilistic reasoning about goal achievement and overrun exceptions.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test queries returned probability values without errors:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results show decreasing probabilities for goal achievement over time and increasing then stabilizing probabilities for overrun exceptions, which matches expected behavior for this system.

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures occurred. The implementation correctly handles:
- Probabilistic actuator selection (50/50 distribution)
- Wind strength modeling (weak/strong with different effect distributions)
- Position calculation with wind effects
- Goal checking and overrun detection

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning is sound:
1. Actuator selection follows P(a)=0.5, P(b)=0.5
2. Wind modeling correctly uses P(weak)=0.7, P(strong)=0.3
3. Wind effects properly condition on wind strength
4. Position updates correctly combine:
   - Previous position (deterministic)
   - Actuator strength (probabilistic choice)
   - Wind effect (probabilistic)
5. Overrun detection properly uses negation-as-failure

**DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no neural network integration)

## 5. Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met:
- **Classical reasoning:** Correctly tracks positions and detects goals/overruns
- **Probabilistic reasoning:** Properly combines multiple probability distributions
- **Neural integration:** Not required/implemented

### Edge Cases Verified:
1. Initial position (time=0) is properly handled
2. Position legality checks work (0-10 range)
3. Wind effects can push positions beyond legal range
4. Goal checking prevents further movement attempts

### Potential Improvements:
1. Add visualization of position probability distributions
2. Include actuator failure probabilities
3. Add time-bound termination condition

## 6. Error Summary

The implementation demonstrates correct probabilistic modeling of a physical control system with multiple interacting stochastic components. The decreasing goal probabilities reflect accumulating uncertainty over time, while the overrun probabilities show the system's vulnerability to extreme wind conditions.
