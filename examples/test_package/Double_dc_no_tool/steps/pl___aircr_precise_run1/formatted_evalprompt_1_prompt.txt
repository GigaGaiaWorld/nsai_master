 1. Check if the goal has been reached:
 If Old already satisfies goal(Old), no new trial position is calculated.
 
 2.Determine the current actuator and its strength:
 Select actuator A (use_actuator) according to time Time, and get its thrust AS from actuator_strength(A).
 
 3. Calculate the direction and contribution of the actuator
 Take the global target position GP (goal(GP)), and compare the difference direction between GP and Old:
 - If the target is in front of the current direction, AE = +AS; if in the opposite direction, AE = −AS;
 - Specific calculation: AE = sign(GP − Old) × AS.
 
 4. Superimpose wind interference:
 Take the additional effect WE of the wind force on the position at that moment from wind_effect(Time).
 
 Combine the trial position of this step:
 Add the three parts and get the current attempt flapping position Pos. </Requirements></Langda>

</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic in achieving the flap movement goal while handling potential overrun exceptions.

## Test Results Summary
The system produced the following query results:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time as expected, showing proper handling of the probabilistic wind effects and actuator selection. Overrun exceptions appear only after the first step, which aligns with the system's design.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Goal checking via `goal_reached/1`
2. Actuator selection through `use_actuator/2`
3. Position calculation in `attempted_flap_position/2`
4. Wind effect application via `wind_effect/2`
5. Legal position validation with `legal_flap_position/1`

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning follows correct principles:
1. Actuator selection uses proper probability distribution (50/50 split)
2. Wind effects correctly depend on wind strength (weak/strong)
3. Probability calculations for position changes account for:
   - `P(¬legal_position) = 1 - P(legal_position)`
   - Combined probabilities of actuator selection and wind effects
4. No DeepProbLog features were used (neural network integration not present)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**:
   - Correctly handles position updates and goal checking
   - Properly prevents position calculation when goal reached

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
   - Accurately combines probabilities from multiple sources
   - Properly models uncertainty in actuator selection and wind effects

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handles position boundaries (0-10 range)
   - Correctly identifies overrun exceptions
   - Properly terminates position updates at goal

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation shows robust handling of all specified scenarios with proper probabilistic reasoning. The only potential improvement would be adding explicit tests for edge cases like initial position at boundary (0 or 10) or goal equal to initial position.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
