# Code Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of an aircraft flap controller system. The model simulates flap position adjustments under actuator selection and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic reasoning and classical logic in achieving the flap movement goal while handling potential overrun exceptions.

## Test Results Summary
The system produced the following query results:
```
goal_reached(1) = 0.2625
goal_reached(2) = 0.1873
goal_reached(3) = 0.1269
goal_reached(4) = 0.0841
goal_reached(5) = 0.0570
overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000
overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030
overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110
overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127
overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114
```

All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time as expected, showing proper handling of the probabilistic wind effects and actuator selection. Overrun exceptions appear only after the first step, which aligns with the system's design.

## Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Goal checking via `goal_reached/1`
2. Actuator selection through `use_actuator/2`
3. Position calculation in `attempted_flap_position/2`
4. Wind effect application via `wind_effect/2`
5. Legal position validation with `legal_flap_position/1`

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic reasoning follows correct principles:
1. Actuator selection uses proper probability distribution (50/50 split)
2. Wind effects correctly depend on wind strength (weak/strong)
3. Probability calculations for position changes account for:
   - `P(Â¬legal_position) = 1 - P(legal_position)`
   - Combined probabilities of actuator selection and wind effects
4. No DeepProbLog features were used (neural network integration not present)

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all functional requirements:

1. **Classical Reasoning**:
   - Correctly handles position updates and goal checking
   - Properly prevents position calculation when goal reached

2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
   - Accurately combines probabilities from multiple sources
   - Properly models uncertainty in actuator selection and wind effects

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handles position boundaries (0-10 range)
   - Correctly identifies overrun exceptions
   - Properly terminates position updates at goal

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | None |

The implementation shows robust handling of all specified scenarios with proper probabilistic reasoning. The only potential improvement would be adding explicit tests for edge cases like initial position at boundary (0 or 10) or goal equal to initial position.
