# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle where AB + BCD = CDE. The solution must satisfy digit constraints (first digits non-zero, all digits unique) and proper columnar addition with carry propagation. The evaluation verifies correctness, identifies failures, and analyzes the implementation.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 10 successful solutions:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies:
1. First digit constraints (A,B,C ≠ 0)
2. Correct columnar addition with carries
3. All digits are unique
4. Proper carry handling (final carry = 0)

## Failure Localization
No test failures occurred. All predicates function correctly:
- `leftdigit/1` (Lines 6-7): Properly restricts first digits
- `sumdigit/5` (Lines 13-17): Correctly models addition with carries
- `all_different/1` (Lines 9-12): Ensures digit uniqueness

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Aspects:**
1. Logical correctness verified through:
   - Proper base case (`all_different([])`)
   - Correct recursive case with `\+ member(H, T)`
   - Termination guaranteed as list shrinks each recursion

2. Arithmetic constraints:
   - `sumdigit` correctly handles both carry scenarios (X < 10 and X ≥ 10)
   - Final carry forced to 0 prevents overflow

**ProbLog Aspects:**
- No probabilistic facts used (pure constraint solving)
- All solutions have probability 1.0 as expected for deterministic solutions
- DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning: Fully satisfied with correct constraint solving
2. Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
3. Neural integration: Not required for this puzzle

**Edge Cases Verified:**
1. First-digit zero prevention works (A,B,C ≠ 0)
2. All solutions have exactly 5 unique digits
3. Final carry always 0 (no overflow)
4. Negative cases automatically fail (e.g., duplicate digits)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add explanatory comments for each sumdigit case
2. Consider adding solution validation predicate
3. Could generalize to any cryptarithmetic puzzle
