# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant selects a door with a prize hidden behind one of three doors. The host then opens a remaining door that doesn't contain the prize, and the contestant can choose to stick with their initial choice or switch. The implementation should demonstrate the well-known probability advantage of switching doors (2/3 chance to win) versus keeping the initial choice (1/3 chance).

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All test results match the expected probabilities:
- Equal 1/3 probability for each door hiding the prize
- Certainty of selecting door 1
- 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
- 2/3 probability of winning by switching

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic behavior.

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The rules for:
1. Random prize placement (lines 1-2)
2. Door selection (line 3)
3. Host behavior when two empty doors remain (lines 5-9)
4. Host behavior when only one empty door remains (lines 11-14)
5. Win conditions (lines 16-21)

All operate as specified in the requirements.

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly handles:
1. **Probability distribution**: The initial prize distribution is uniform (1/3 for each door)
2. **Host behavior**: 
   - When two empty doors remain, the host chooses randomly between them (50/50)
   - When only one empty door remains, the host must choose it (probability 1)
3. **Negation**: Proper use of `\+` for negative conditions
4. **Win conditions**: 
   - `win_keep` correctly identifies when the initial selection has the prize
   - `win_switch` correctly identifies when switching would lead to the prize

The probabilistic calculations comply with standard rules:
- P(Â¬prize(X)) = 1 - P(prize(X))
- The host's door opening creates the proper conditional probabilities

**DeepProbLog feature not used** - No neural network integration was required for this problem.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation fully meets the requirements for:
- **Classical reasoning**: Correct logical structure for door selection and prize location
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Proper handling of probability distributions and conditional probabilities

Edge cases handled correctly:
- All possible prize locations (doors 1-3)
- All possible host choices when multiple empty doors remain
- The case where only one empty door remains

## Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem with proper probabilistic reasoning and handles all specified edge cases. No errors were detected during evaluation. The results demonstrate the classic probability advantage of switching doors in this scenario.
