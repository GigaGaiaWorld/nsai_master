# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program modeling a robot's key pickup scenario with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose is to verify correct implementation of probabilistic facts, classical logic rules, and proper handling of recursive temporal states.

## Test Results Summary
The program executed 2 queries with 7 probabilistic results:
```
carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331
at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000
at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900
at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100
at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670
at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330
at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000
```
All test results are consistent with expected probabilistic behavior. No failures detected.

## Failure Localization
All tests passed (no failures). The implementation correctly handles:
1. Temporal state transitions (lines 1-30)
2. Probabilistic actions (lines 32-33)
3. Object location tracking (lines 35-50)
4. Recursive termination (base cases at time=0)

## Root Cause Analysis
### Logical Correctness
- Recursive rules properly propagate state through time steps
- Negation-as-failure correctly implements `\+` conditions
- Base cases (`at/3` facts at time 0) ensure termination

### Probabilistic Rules
- Probability calculations follow standard rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` in drop/fumble rules
  - Disjoint probabilities sum to 1.0 (e.g., 0.7::pickup_succeeds + 0.3::pickup_fails)
- Joint probabilities correctly computed for dependent events

### DeepProbLog Integration
DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network calls present)

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully implemented through recursive state transitions
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correct probability distributions for all actions
3. **Neural Integration**: Not applicable (no `nn/3` or tensor operations)

### Edge Cases Verified
1. Undefined locations handled via negation
2. Recursive depth limited by fixed time steps
3. All probabilistic alternatives accounted for
4. Object persistence properly maintained

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |

| - | None | - | - |

The implementation correctly models the probabilistic key pickup scenario with proper handling of temporal states and action outcomes. All test cases pass with expected probability distributions. No corrective actions needed.
