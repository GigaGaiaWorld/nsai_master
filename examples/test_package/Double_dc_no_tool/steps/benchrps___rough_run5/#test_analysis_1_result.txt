# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on game rule definition, outcome calculation, and score determination. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Result:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly:
1. Identified paper beats rock (first two rounds)
2. Identified rock beats scissors (third round)
3. Calculated the final score (-1 + -1 + 1 = -1)
4. Correctly determined player2 as the winner

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following components were verified:
- Move definitions (lines 3-5)
- Beat relationships (lines 7-9)
- Outcome rules (lines 14-16)
- Play recursion (lines 18-21)
- Score computation (lines 23-26)
- Winner determination (lines 27-31)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All game rules properly reflect rock-paper-scissors semantics
2. **Recursive Termination**: Base cases exist for both `play/3` and `compute_score/2`
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: Not used in this implementation (pure logical programming)
4. **DeepProbLog Features**: Not utilized in this code (no neural network integration)

Key correct behaviors:
- Proper handling of draw conditions (`outcome(P,P,draw)`)
- Correct score accumulation (win=+1, lose=-1, draw=0)
- Accurate winner determination based on final score

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required/implemented
- Neural network integration: Not required/implemented

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list inputs**: Would cause type errors (not explicitly handled)
2. **Uneven move lists**: Would fail due to unmatched recursion (not handled)
3. **Invalid moves**: Would fail as only rock/paper/scissor are defined
4. **Deep recursion**: Not a concern for typical game lengths

**Suggested Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for move lists
2. Handle uneven move lists gracefully
3. Consider extending with probabilistic versions of moves

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking |
| 2 | Uneven lists unhandled | May cause recursion errors | Implement length checking |
| 3 | Limited move options | Can't extend without modification | Consider dynamic move addition |
