</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a Prolog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on game rule definition, outcome calculation, and score determination. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
Result:
```
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
```

**All tests passed (no failures)** - The implementation correctly:
1. Identified paper beats rock (first two rounds)
2. Identified rock beats scissors (third round)
3. Calculated the final score (-1 + -1 + 1 = -1)
4. Correctly determined player2 as the winner

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The following components were verified:
- Move definitions (lines 3-5)
- Beat relationships (lines 7-9)
- Outcome rules (lines 14-16)
- Play recursion (lines 18-21)
- Score computation (lines 23-26)
- Winner determination (lines 27-31)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct classical Prolog behavior:
1. **Logical Correctness**: All game rules properly reflect rock-paper-scissors semantics
2. **Recursive Termination**: Base cases exist for both `play/3` and `compute_score/2`
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: Not used in this implementation (pure logical programming)
4. **DeepProbLog Features**: Not utilized in this code (no neural network integration)

Key correct behaviors:
- Proper handling of draw conditions (`outcome(P,P,draw)`)
- Correct score accumulation (win=+1, lose=-1, draw=0)
- Accurate winner determination based on final score

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented and correct
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required/implemented
- Neural network integration: Not required/implemented

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Non-list inputs**: Would cause type errors (not explicitly handled)
2. **Uneven move lists**: Would fail due to unmatched recursion (not handled)
3. **Invalid moves**: Would fail as only rock/paper/scissor are defined
4. **Deep recursion**: Not a concern for typical game lengths

**Suggested Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for move lists
2. Handle uneven move lists gracefully
3. Consider extending with probabilistic versions of moves

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on invalid inputs | Add type checking |
| 2 | Uneven lists unhandled | May cause recursion errors | Implement length checking |
| 3 | Limited move options | Can't extend without modification | Consider dynamic move addition |

**Word Count**: 428 words (including tables and code blocks)

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
