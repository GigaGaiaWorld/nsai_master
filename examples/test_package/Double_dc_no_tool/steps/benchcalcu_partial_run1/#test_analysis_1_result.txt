# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle (AB + BCD = CDE). The code uses constraint satisfaction to find digit assignments that satisfy the equation while adhering to arithmetic rules and uniqueness constraints.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 10 successful solutions:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
All tests passed (no failures). Each solution satisfies:
1. First-digit constraints (A,B,C â‰  0)
2. Correct column-wise addition with carry propagation
3. All-digit uniqueness constraint

## Failure Localization
No test failures occurred. All predicates function correctly:
- `leftdigit/1` (Lines 6-7) properly restricts first digits
- `sumdigit/5` (Lines 14-18) correctly implements addition with carry
- `all_different/1` (Lines 10-13) ensures digit uniqueness

## Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The program correctly models the cryptarithmetic problem through constrained generation and testing
2. **Recursive Termination**: The `all_different/1` recursion terminates properly on empty lists
3. **Probabilistic Aspects**: Since this is a deterministic problem, all solutions have probability 1.0000
4. **DeepProbLog**: Feature not used (no neural network integration)

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented via constraint satisfaction
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required for this deterministic problem
- Neural network integration: Not applicable

**Edge Cases Verified**:
1. First-digit zero prevention works (tested in all solutions)
2. Carry propagation handles all cases (0 and 1)
3. Uniqueness constraint covers all digit positions

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Could add solution count verification (should be exactly 10)
2. Might optimize by reordering constraints for faster solving

## Error Summary
