# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density (within 5% difference). The program calculates population density from provided facts about population and area, then finds country pairs meeting the density similarity criteria.

## 2. Test Results Summary
All test cases passed successfully. The program returned 8 correct country pairs with matching density ratios between 0.95 and 1.05:

```
query_pop([china, 244.0828402366864, france, 246.4788732394366]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223.859649122807, pakistan, 219.2926045016077]) = 1.0000
query_pop([pakistan, 219.2926045016077, indonesia, 223.859649122807]) = 1.0000
query_pop([mexico, 76.04712041884817, ethiopia, 77.71428571428571]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477.58620689655174, philippines, 461.1111111111111]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 246.4788732394366, china, 244.0828402366864]) = 1.0000
query_pop([philippines, 461.1111111111111, italy, 477.58620689655174]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77.71428571428571, mexico, 76.04712041884817]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## 3. Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test results. The program correctly:
1. Calculates density using the formula `(Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000)`
2. Compares country pairs with density ratios between 0.95 and 1.05
3. Excludes same-country comparisons with `Country1 \= Country2`
4. Returns results in both directionally symmetric forms (A,B and B,A)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The program demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical ProbLog:

1. **Density Calculation**:
```prolog
density(Country, Density) :- 
    pop(Country, Pop), 
    area(Country, Area), 
    Density is (Pop * 100000) / (Area * 1000).
```
- Correctly handles unit conversion (population in 100,000s and area in 1,000 sq miles)
- Proper arithmetic operations with floating-point division

2. **Query Predicate**:
```prolog
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    Ratio is Density1 / Density2,
    Ratio >= 0.95,
    Ratio =< 1.05.
```
- Correct comparison logic with 5% tolerance
- Proper handling of symmetric cases
- No probabilistic facts or neural network integration used (pure logical program)

## 5. Overall Analysis

### Requirements Met:
- ✅ Classical reasoning: Fully implemented density calculation and comparison
- ✅ Functional requirements: Correctly finds country pairs with similar density
- ✅ Edge cases: Handles same-country exclusion and bidirectional matching

### Edge Cases Verified:
1. No same-country pairs appear in results
2. All density calculations are mathematically correct
3. Symmetric pairs (A,B and B,A) both appear in results
4. No floating-point calculation errors detected

### Limitations:
1. No probabilistic facts or uncertainty handling
2. No DeepProbLog features used (neural network integration)
3. No performance optimization for large datasets
