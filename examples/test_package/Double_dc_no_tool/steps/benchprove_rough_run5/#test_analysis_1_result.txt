# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program implementing a meta-interpreter with extended logic processing capabilities. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of classical reasoning predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.) and their test results, while also checking compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning principles.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
1. `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob),ancestor(alice,bob)))` succeeded (1.0000)
2. All other queries failed (0.0000):
   - `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))`
   - `prove(expand(double(3),6))`
   - `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))`
   - `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))`

## Failure Localization
1. **Missing Predicates** (Lines N/A):
   - `opposite/1` not implemented
   - `includes/2` not implemented
   - `extend/3` not implemented (note: test expects 3-arity while requirements specify 2-arity)
   
2. **Expand Predicate Issue**:
   - `expand/2` is defined but test fails because:
     - The test expects `prove/1` to handle `expand` goals automatically
     - No rule connects `prove(expand(...))` to the `expand/2` predicate

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Classical Context**:
   - Only `implies/2` is properly implemented (hash 3F5BA02C)
   - Recursive termination is correct for implemented predicates
   - Missing implementations violate requirements

2. **Probabilistic Context**:
   - No probabilistic facts/rules are used in this program
   - Missing negation handling (`opposite/1` should implement `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`)
   - No neural network calls detected ("DeepProbLog feature not used")

## Overall Analysis
1. **Requirements Met**:
   - Basic meta-interpreter works correctly
   - Only 1/6 required predicates (`implies/2`) is implemented

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Non-list inputs not handled
   - Undefined predicates fail silently
   - Arity mismatch in `extend` requirements vs test

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Missing `opposite/1` | Fails negation tests | Implement using `\+` or probabilistic negation |
| 2 | Missing `includes/2` | Fails membership tests | Reuse `member/2` or implement separately |
| 3 | Missing `extend/2` | Fails list extension | Implement as `extend(E,L,[E|L])` |
| 4 | `expand/2` not connected | Fails expansion tests | Add `prove(expand(X,Y)) :- expand(X,Y).` |
| 5 | Arity mismatch | Test expects extend/3 | Align requirements and tests |

The implementation currently only satisfies 16.7% of the required functionality (1/6 predicates). The core meta-interpreter is sound, but the extended logic processing predicates need to be implemented according to requirements. Special attention should be paid to the probabilistic aspects when implementing `opposite/1` and `refute/1`.
