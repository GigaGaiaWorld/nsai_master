# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation solving the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must adhere to three key constraints: 
1) First digits cannot be zero, 
2) All letters represent unique digits, 
3) Column-wise addition with proper carry handling.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show 10 successful solutions:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies all constraints:
1. First digits (A,B,C) are non-zero (verified by `leftdigit/1`)
2. All digits are unique (verified by `all_different/1`)
3. Column additions with carry are correct (verified by `sumdigit/5`)

## Failure Localization
No test failures occurred. All expansion predicates (`digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and function as intended in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

## Root Cause Analysis
### Classical Prolog Aspects
- **Logical Correctness**: The implementation correctly models the puzzle constraints:
  ```prolog
  sumdigit(Cin, A, B, Sum, Cout) :- 
    X is Cin + A + B,
    ( X < 10, Sum = X, Cout = 0 ; X >= 10, Sum is X - 10, Cout = 1 ).
  ```
  handles both cases of addition (with/without carry) accurately.

- **Recursive Termination**: `all_different/1` terminates properly as the list shrinks with each recursive call.

### Probabilistic Aspects
- The solution uses deterministic facts (`digit/1`) without probabilistic annotations, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` don't apply here.
- **DeepProbLog Check**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) was used. 

## Overall Analysis
### Requirements Met
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Fully satisfied - Correctly solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle with all constraints.
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts/rules).
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).

### Edge Cases Considered
1. **First Digit Zero**: Properly handled by `leftdigit/1`
2. **Unique Digits**: `all_different/1` prevents duplicates
3. **Carry Propagation**: `sumdigit/5` correctly handles multi-column carries
4. **Input Validation**: Implicitly handled by predicate constraints
