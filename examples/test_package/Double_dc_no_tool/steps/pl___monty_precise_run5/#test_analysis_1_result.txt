# Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog: Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem, where a contestant chooses between keeping their initial door selection or switching after one empty door is revealed. The purpose is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning and ensure the implementation matches the known mathematical probabilities of this problem.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show:
```
prize(1) = 0.3333
prize(2) = 0.3333
prize(3) = 0.3333
select_door(1) = 1.0000
win_keep = 0.3333
win_switch = 0.6667
```

All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly reflect:
1. Uniform 1/3 probability distribution for the prize location
2. Certainty of initial door selection (door 1)
3. 1/3 probability of winning by keeping the initial choice
4. 2/3 probability of winning by switching doors

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. The code correctly handles:
- The initial random prize placement (lines 1-2)
- Door selection (line 3)
- Host behavior rules (lines 5-20)
- Win condition definitions (lines 22-28)

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation correctly follows probabilistic rules:
1. Prize distribution: `P(prize(X)) = 1/3` for each door (lines 1-2)
2. Host behavior:
   - When two empty doors available: random 50/50 choice (lines 5-12, hash E2FA63E7)
   - When only one empty door available: deterministic choice (lines 14-20, hash B4161B21)
3. Win probabilities:
   - `P(win_keep) = P(prize(1)) = 1/3`
   - `P(win_switch) = 1 - P(win_keep) = 2/3`

The code properly handles all possible cases through the two `open_door` rules, ensuring correct probabilistic reasoning.

## Overall Analysis
The implementation successfully meets all requirements:
1. **Classical reasoning**: Correctly models the game rules and constraints
2. **Probabilistic reasoning**: Accurately computes the probabilities
3. **Neural network integration**: DeepProbLog feature not used (not required)

Edge cases handled correctly:
- All possible prize locations
- All possible host door-opening scenarios
- Both winning conditions (keep vs switch)

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| - | None | - | - |

The implementation is correct and complete, properly modeling the Monty Hall problem with accurate probabilistic outcomes. The 1/3 vs 2/3 winning probabilities for keeping vs switching are correctly computed, matching the known mathematical solution to this classic probability puzzle.
