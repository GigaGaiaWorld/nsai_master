# Code Evaluation Report: Population Density Query in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to query countries with approximately equal population density. The program calculates population densities from provided population and area data, then finds country pairs where their densities are within 5% of each other (using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations).

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show four successful queries:
```
query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)**. Each result shows country pairs with densities satisfying the 5% approximation requirement (20×D1 < 21×D2 and 20×D2 < 21×D1).

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures were detected. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented according to requirements:
- `density/2` correctly calculates integer density using floor division (line 3A3D0149)
- `query_pop/1` properly implements the 5% approximation check (line DE4779C6)

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
In classical ProbLog terms:
1. **Logical Correctness**: The program correctly implements the required logic without recursion or complex control flow.
2. **Probabilistic Rules**: Since this is a deterministic query (all probabilities = 1.0000), probabilistic rules don't apply here.
3. **DeepProbLog Features**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor`) is used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used".

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements Met**:
- Classical reasoning: Fully implemented with correct population density calculations
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not required for this deterministic query
- Neural network integration: Not used

**Edge Cases Considered**:
1. The 5% approximation using integer arithmetic (20/21 ratio) handles floating-point precision issues
2. The `C1 @< C2` constraint prevents duplicate pairs in different orders
3. Floor division in density calculation matches the specification

**Potential Improvements**:
1. Could add validation for negative populations/areas
2. Might include more countries for comprehensive testing
3. Could add probabilistic facts for uncertain population data

## 6. Error Summary

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | All tests passed | 
| 2 | DeepProbLog not used | None | Consider adding if probabilistic data becomes available |

**Code Blocks Verified**:
```prolog
% Density calculation (hash: 3A3D0149)
density(C,D) :-
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    D is (P * 100) // A.

% Query predicate (hash: DE4779C6)
query_pop([C1,D1,C2,D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 @< C2,
    20*D1 < 21*D2,
    20*D2 < 21*D1.
```

The implementation meets all specified requirements with proper handling of population density calculations and comparison logic. The test cases adequately verify the core functionality.
