# ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program that models coin tossing with a biased coin (p=0.8 for heads). The program recursively counts heads (S) when tossing CNT coins, with a specific test case of CNT=4. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, probabilistic computation accuracy, and requirement compliance.

## Test Results Summary
The test results show the probability distribution for total heads when tossing 4 coins:
```
total(4) = 0.4096
total(3) = 0.4096
total(2) = 0.1536
total(1) = 0.0256
total(0) = 0.0016
```
All tests passed (no failures). The results correctly follow binomial distribution probabilities for 4 trials with p=0.8 (e.g., P(4 heads)=0.8⁴=0.4096, P(0 heads)=0.2⁴=0.0016).

## Failure Localization
No failures detected. The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly:
1. Handles base case (line 3: `coins_r(SC,SC,0)`)
2. Counts heads when `coin(CNT)` succeeds (lines 5-9)
3. Skips counting when `coin(CNT)` fails (lines 10-14)

## Root Cause Analysis
The probabilistic computation is correct:
1. `P(heads) = 0.8` is properly defined via `make_coin(C,0.8)`
2. Negation probability `P(¬coin(CNT)) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2` is implicitly handled
3. Combined probabilities follow binomial distribution:
   - `P(k heads in n trials) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)`
   
DeepProbLog feature not used (no neural network integration).

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements met:**
- Classical reasoning: Correct recursive counting
- Probabilistic reasoning: Accurate binomial probability calculation
- Neural integration: Not required

**Edge cases handled:**
1. Base case (CNT=0) terminates recursion
2. Probability bounds (0≤P≤1) maintained
3. Integer counting prevents floating-point errors

**Potential improvements:**
1. Parameterize the number of coins (hardcoded as 4 in `total/1`)
2. Add input validation for CNT≥0

**Code Correctness Verification:**
```problog
% Probabilistic fact definition - correct
PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).

% Recursive counting - correct
coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(CNT),       % Probabilistic choice
    SC1 is SC + 1,   % Count head
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC1,S,CNT1).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    \+ coin(CNT),    % Negation handled
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC,S,CNT1).
