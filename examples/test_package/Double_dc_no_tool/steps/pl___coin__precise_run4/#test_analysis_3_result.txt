# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a given probability. The program should recursively count successful outcomes (heads) when tossing multiple coins. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, probabilistic reasoning, and proper implementation of recursive termination.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show a critical failure during execution:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 7:12
```
The program fails to execute any queries due to a syntax error in the conditional statement implementation.

## 3. Failure Localization
- **Failed Component**: Conditional statement in `coins_r/3` predicate
- **Location**: Line 7, Column 12
- **Error Type**: Syntax/implementation error
- **Problem**: The code attempts to use `->/2` operator incorrectly in a ProbLog context
- **Expected**: Proper ProbLog syntax for conditional probability handling

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues identified are:

1. **Syntax Error**:
   - The conditional statement `(coin(CNT) -> NSC is SC + 1; NSC = SC)` is not valid ProbLog syntax
   - ProbLog requires different handling of probabilistic conditions

2. **Probabilistic Fact Handling**:
   - The program doesn't properly account for the 0.8 probability of `coin(C)` being true
   - The recursive counting doesn't correctly accumulate probabilities

3. **Classical vs Probabilistic Context**:
   - The code mixes Prolog-style conditionals with ProbLog requirements
   - ProbLog needs explicit probability annotations for all probabilistic operations

## 5. Overall Analysis
The current implementation fails to meet requirements due to:

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially implemented but with syntax errors
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not properly implemented
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling for negative counter values
   - No validation for probability bounds
   - Recursive depth is fixed (4 levels) which could cause stack issues with larger numbers

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Invalid conditional syntax | Program fails to execute | Replace with proper ProbLog probabilistic rules |
| 2 | Improper probability accumulation | Incorrect result calculation | Implement proper probability combination in recursion |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog features | Limited functionality | Consider neural network integration if needed |
| 4 | Fixed recursion depth | Inflexible implementation | Make counter parameter configurable |

## 7. Recommended Fixes
```problog
% Corrected implementation
PH::make_coin(C,PH).
coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).

coins_r(SC,SC,0).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(CNT),      % Probabilistic fact
    NSC is SC + 1,
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    \+ coin(CNT),   % Negation of probabilistic fact
    NSC = SC,
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1).

total(S) :- coins_r(0,S,4).
query(total(_)).
```

This corrected version properly handles the probabilistic nature of the coin tosses while maintaining the recursive counting structure. The probability of each outcome will be automatically calculated by ProbLog's inference engine.
