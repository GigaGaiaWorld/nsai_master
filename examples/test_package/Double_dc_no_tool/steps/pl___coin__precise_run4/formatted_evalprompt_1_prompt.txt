problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character '(' at 7:1.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

# Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog program designed to simulate coin tosses with a biased coin (0.8 probability of heads). The program counts successful heads outcomes over multiple trials using recursive processing. The evaluation focuses on syntax correctness, logical flow, and probabilistic computation.

## Test Results Summary
The code fails to execute due to a syntax error:
```
Unmatched character '(' at 7:1
```
No queries could be successfully executed due to this fundamental syntax issue. The error occurs during parsing before any probabilistic computation begins.

## Failure Localization
The primary failure occurs in the recursive `coins_r/3` predicate implementation. The problematic section is:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
 CNT > 0,
 
<Langda>
<Code_Block>(coin(CNT) -> 
        NSC is SC + 1, 
        CNT1 is CNT - 1, 
        coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1)
    ; 
        CNT1 is CNT - 1, 
        coins_r(SC,S,CNT1)</Code_Block>
```

The error stems from improper syntax mixing (XML-like tags within Prolog code) and malformed conditional statements. The correct ProbLog syntax should use `if-then-else` without XML tags.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Syntax Errors**: The code contains invalid XML-like tags (`<Langda>`, `<Code_Block>`) within Prolog syntax
2. **Conditional Structure**: The if-then-else construct is improperly formatted
3. **Probabilistic Aspect**: While the intended probabilistic logic (0.8 bias) is correctly specified in `coin(C)`, the recursive counting mechanism is unimplementable due to syntax errors

Correct probabilistic rules would require:
```prolog
coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    ( coin(CNT) ->
        NSC is SC + 1,
        CNT1 is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(NSC,S,CNT1)
    ;
        CNT1 is CNT - 1,
        coins_r(SC,S,CNT1).
```

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Not achieved (syntax error)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Partially specified but not executable
   - Neural network integration: DeepProbLog feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No handling for negative CNT values
   - No base case validation
   - Recursive depth could be problematic for large CNT values

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | XML tags in Prolog code | Complete failure | Remove all non-Prolog markup |
| 2 | Malformed if-then-else | Syntax error | Use proper Prolog conditional syntax |
| 3 | Missing base case validation | Potential infinite recursion | Add explicit base case handling |
| 4 | No negative CNT handling | Possible logical errors | Add CNT >= 0 validation |

**Word count**: 398

The code requires complete restructuring using proper ProbLog syntax before any probabilistic evaluation can occur. The core logic appears mathematically sound (counting successes with given probability), but implementation errors prevent execution.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
