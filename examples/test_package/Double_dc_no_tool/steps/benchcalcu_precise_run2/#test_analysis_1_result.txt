# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must adhere to three key requirements:
1. Digit constraints (first digits â‰  0)
2. Unique digit assignments
3. Proper arithmetic with carry propagation

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows:
```
query_sum([X6, X7, X8, X9, X10]) = 0.0000
```
This indicates the query failed to find any valid solutions (probability 0.0). This is unexpected as the puzzle should have at least one valid solution (e.g., 12 + 234 = 246).

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the main `query_sum` predicate where:
1. The carry propagation logic in `sumdigit` calls appears correct
2. The digit constraints (`leftdigit`) are properly enforced
3. The uniqueness check (`all_different`) is correctly implemented

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue stems from an incorrect arithmetic formulation in the main predicate. The current implementation:
```prolog
AB is 10*A + B,
BCD is 100*B + 10*C + D,
CDE is 100*C + 10*D + E
```
is correct for number construction, but the puzzle's structure requires:
```
  AB
+BCD
----
 CDE
```
The carry propagation through `sumdigit` predicates appears correct, but the digit assignments may be conflicting with the arithmetic constraints.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct constraints but no solution found)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
   - DeepProbLog: Feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - First-digit zero prevention works correctly
   - Unique digit enforcement is proper
   - Missing validation for cases where B=0 in BCD

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No solutions found | Puzzle unsolved | Re-examine arithmetic constraints |
| 2 | Potential digit conflicts | Incorrect results | Add trace output for intermediate values |
| 3 | Missing solution verification | Uncertain correctness | Manually verify with known solution |

## Recommended Fixes
1. Add debugging output to trace digit assignments:
```prolog
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
    write('Trying: '), write([A,B,C,D,E]), nl,
    % ... rest of the predicate
```

2. Verify with a known solution:
```prolog
% Should succeed with A=1,B=2,C=2,D=3,E=4
test_case :- query_sum([1,2,2,3,4]). 
```

3. Consider revising the carry logic to ensure proper digit alignment in the addition.

The implementation shows proper structure but requires debugging to identify why valid solutions are being rejected.
