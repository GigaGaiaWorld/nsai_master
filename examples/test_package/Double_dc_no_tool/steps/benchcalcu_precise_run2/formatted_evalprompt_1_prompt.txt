</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle in ProbLog

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must adhere to three key requirements:
1. Digit constraints (first digits ≠ 0)
2. Unique digit assignments
3. Proper arithmetic with carry propagation

## Test Results Summary
The test result shows:
```
query_sum([X6, X7, X8, X9, X10]) = 0.0000
```
This indicates the query failed to find any valid solutions (probability 0.0). This is unexpected as the puzzle should have at least one valid solution (e.g., 12 + 234 = 246).

## Failure Localization
The error occurs in the main `query_sum` predicate where:
1. The carry propagation logic in `sumdigit` calls appears correct
2. The digit constraints (`leftdigit`) are properly enforced
3. The uniqueness check (`all_different`) is correctly implemented

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue stems from an incorrect arithmetic formulation in the main predicate. The current implementation:
```prolog
AB is 10*A + B,
BCD is 100*B + 10*C + D,
CDE is 100*C + 10*D + E
```
is correct for number construction, but the puzzle's structure requires:
```
  AB
+BCD
----
 CDE
```
The carry propagation through `sumdigit` predicates appears correct, but the digit assignments may be conflicting with the arithmetic constraints.

## Overall Analysis
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Classical reasoning: Partially met (correct constraints but no solution found)
   - Probabilistic reasoning: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts)
   - DeepProbLog: Feature not used

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - First-digit zero prevention works correctly
   - Unique digit enforcement is proper
   - Missing validation for cases where B=0 in BCD

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No solutions found | Puzzle unsolved | Re-examine arithmetic constraints |
| 2 | Potential digit conflicts | Incorrect results | Add trace output for intermediate values |
| 3 | Missing solution verification | Uncertain correctness | Manually verify with known solution |

## Recommended Fixes
1. Add debugging output to trace digit assignments:
```prolog
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
    write('Trying: '), write([A,B,C,D,E]), nl,
    % ... rest of the predicate
```

2. Verify with a known solution:
```prolog
% Should succeed with A=1,B=2,C=2,D=3,E=4
test_case :- query_sum([1,2,2,3,4]). 
```

3. Consider revising the carry logic to ensure proper digit alignment in the addition.

The implementation shows proper structure but requires debugging to identify why valid solutions are being rejected.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
