  "ErrorSummary": "The query_sum predicate fails to find valid solutions due to potential arithmetic constraint conflicts in digit assignments and carry propagation",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add debugging output to trace digit assignments\n2. Verify with known solution (e.g., test_case :- query_sum([1,2,2,3,4]))\n3. Re-examine carry logic to ensure proper digit alignment in addition\n4. Consider adding constraints to prevent B=0 in BCD if needed",
