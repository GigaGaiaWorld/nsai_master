# Code Evaluation Report: Cryptarithmetic Puzzle in ProbLog

## 1. Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the cryptarithmetic puzzle "AB + BCD = CDE". The solution must satisfy digit constraints, uniqueness of letter assignments, and proper arithmetic with carry propagation. The evaluation verifies logical correctness, requirement compliance, and edge case handling.

## 2. Test Results Summary
The test results show 10 successful solutions:
```
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```
**All tests passed (no failures)** - Each solution satisfies:
1. First-digit constraints via `leftdigit/1`
2. Unique digit assignments via `all_different/1`
3. Correct arithmetic with carries via `sumdigit/5`

## 3. Failure Localization
No test failures occurred. All expansion predicates (`digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and functionally complete.

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- The recursive `all_different/1` properly terminates when the list is empty (base case) and checks each element via `member/2`
- Arithmetic constraints in `sumdigit/5` correctly handle both carry scenarios (X < 10 and X ≥ 10)
- No infinite recursion risks due to finite digit domains (0-9)

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- The solution uses classical ProbLog without probabilistic facts (all probabilities = 1.0000)
- No probabilistic rules (¬, ⇒) or neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor`) are present
- **DeepProbLog feature not used**

## 5. Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. **Digit constraints**: Achieved via `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`
2. **Uniqueness**: Enforced by `all_different/1`
3. **Arithmetic**: Correctly implemented in `sumdigit/5` with carry propagation

**Edge Cases Verified:**
- First digits never 0 (e.g., no solutions like [0,7,8,2,9])
- All solutions have unique digit assignments
- No invalid inputs (all variables are digits)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add probabilistic constraints for uncertain digit assignments
2. Include neural network integration for learning digit patterns (DeepProbLog)
3. Optimize `all_different/1` for larger puzzles (currently O(n²))

## 6. Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No probabilistic reasoning | Limits expressiveness | Add probabilistic facts/rules |
| 2 | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Consider `nn/3` for learned constraints |
| 3 | Basic all_different/1 | Performance on large N | Use CLP(FD) constraints |

**Conclusion**: The implementation fully meets classical requirements but could benefit from probabilistic/neural extensions.
