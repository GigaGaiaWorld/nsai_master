# Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, focusing on move definitions, win/lose rules, game result calculation, and score computation. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test coverage, and edge case handling.

## Test Results Summary
The code was tested with one query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** All tests passed (no failures). The result correctly shows player2 as the winner (2 losses and 1 win for player1, resulting in a negative score).

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates function as intended:
- Move definitions (rock, paper, scissor) are complete
- Win/lose relationships (beats/2) are correctly defined
- Game result calculation (result/3) handles all cases
- Score computation (compute_score/2) properly processes win/lose/draw outcomes

## Root Cause Analysis
The implementation demonstrates correct logical behavior in classical ProbLog:
1. **Base Cases:** Properly handles empty lists in play/3 and compute_score/2
2. **Recursion:** Correctly terminates and accumulates scores
3. **Probability:** Since no probabilistic facts are used, all results are deterministic (1.0)
4. **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration (DeepProbLog feature not used)

Key logical rules verified:
```prolog
beats(rock, scissor).  % Correct
beats(paper, rock).    % Correct
beats(scissor, paper). % Correct
```

## Overall Analysis
**Functional Requirements:**
- Classical reasoning: Fully met (correct game logic implementation)
- Probabilistic reasoning: Not utilized (no probabilistic facts)
- Neural network integration: Not present

**Edge Cases Considered:**
1. Empty move lists handled by base cases
2. All possible move combinations covered
3. Score calculation handles all result types (win/lose/draw)

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for move lists
2. Consider adding probabilistic moves
3. Include tie-breaking logic for equal scores

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | None | All requirements met |
| 2 | DeepProbLog not used | Limited functionality | Consider neural integration for move prediction |
| 3 | No input validation | Possible runtime errors | Add type checking for moves |

The implementation correctly models the rock-paper-scissors game with proper handling of all game scenarios. While currently limited to classical ProbLog, it provides a solid foundation for potential probabilistic extensions.
