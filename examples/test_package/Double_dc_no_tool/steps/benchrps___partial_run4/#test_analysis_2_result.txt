# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic Evaluation Report

## Background and Purpose
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines move relationships, win/lose conditions, and implements game result calculation through recursive list processing. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test case coverage, and proper handling of probabilistic reasoning where applicable.

## Test Results Summary
The test case provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`

**Verification:** This test passes as expected. The result correctly shows player2 winning with:
- First two rounds: paper beats rock (player2 wins)
- Third round: rock beats scissor (player1 wins)
- Final score: -1 (player2 wins)

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures)

## Failure Localization
No failures were detected in the test cases. The implementation correctly handles:
1. Move definitions (rock, paper, scissor)
2. Beat relationships (all three combinations)
3. Result calculation (win/lose/draw)
4. Score computation (recursive tallying)
5. Winner determination (comparison of final score)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
1. **Logical Correctness:** All predicates follow correct logical relationships
2. **Recursive Termination:** Base cases are properly defined for both `play/3` and `compute_score/2`
3. **Edge Cases:** Handles empty lists and draw conditions correctly

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
1. The implementation uses classical Prolog without probabilistic facts
2. No DeepProbLog features (neural network integration) were used
3. All results have probability 1.0000 indicating deterministic reasoning

**DeepProbLog Feature Check:** DeepProbLog feature not used

## Overall Analysis
**Requirements Met:**
1. Classical reasoning fully implemented and correct
2. Probabilistic reasoning not required/implemented
3. Neural network integration not required/implemented

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. **Input Validation:** Non-move inputs would fail (expected behavior)
2. **List Length Mismatch:** Uneven move lists would fail (should be handled)
3. **Performance:** Recursion depth limited by stack size (unlikely issue for normal games)

**Improvement Suggestions:**
1. Add input validation for move lists
2. Handle uneven list lengths gracefully
3. Consider adding probabilistic variations if needed

## Error Summary

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | No input validation | May crash on invalid moves | Add move validation predicate |
| 2 | Uneven lists unhandled | May cause unexpected failures | Add length check or padding |
| 3 | No probabilistic rules | Limits game variation | Add random move selection |

The implementation correctly handles the basic rock-paper-scissors game logic with proper recursive processing and result calculation. While meeting all current requirements, some defensive programming improvements could enhance robustness.
