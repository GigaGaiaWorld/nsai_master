  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error. The predicate 'member/2' is used instead of 'my_member/2', which is not defined in the code. This inconsistency causes the program to fail during execution. The original code correctly uses 'my_member/2' and runs successfully, producing the expected result. The generated code needs to correct the predicate name to match the original code for it to be valid and produce consistent results."
