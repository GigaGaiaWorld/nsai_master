  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for the prize, select_door, win_keep, and win_switch queries. The generated code simplifies the conditions for open_door by explicitly stating the constraints, making it slightly clearer while maintaining the same logical flow. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
