  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. Both codes correctly implement the rock-paper-scissors game rules and determine the winner based on the computed score. The generated code simplifies the result calculation by directly using the beats predicate in separate clauses for win, lose, and draw, which is a valid approach. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their equivalence."
