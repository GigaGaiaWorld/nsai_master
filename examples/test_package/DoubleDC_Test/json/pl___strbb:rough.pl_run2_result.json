  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, the 'bb' predicate in the generated code has been simplified by combining conditions, which changes its behavior. The original code checks for consecutive 'b's up to N-1, while the generated code checks for consecutive 'b's up to N, leading to a different probability calculation. This results in a different output probability (0.6484 vs 0.3750)."
