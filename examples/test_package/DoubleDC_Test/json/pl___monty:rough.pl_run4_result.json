  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining the same probabilistic behavior as the original code. It simplifies the door-opening rules into a single clause while preserving the essential constraints: the opened door must not have the prize and must not be the initially selected door. The generated code produces identical results to the original, with win_keep at 0.3333 and win_switch at 0.6667, demonstrating correct probabilistic reasoning."
