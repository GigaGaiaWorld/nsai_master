  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining consistency with the original code's functionality. It simplifies the door-opening rule by using a findall predicate to identify valid doors that can be opened, ensuring the host's behavior remains probabilistic (50/50 when two doors are available). The results match the original, showing correct probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors."
