/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not consistent with the original code in terms of logic and results. The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips, resulting in a binomial distribution of outcomes. The generated code incorrectly modifies the logic by always checking `coin(CNT)` before the conditional, which leads to incorrect probability calculations. This results in all outcomes having the same probability (0.4096), which is not the expected behavior.
