/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It simplifies the conditions for opening a door by explicitly stating the constraints (A \= Selected, B \= Selected, A \= B) which makes the code clearer while maintaining the same probabilistic behavior. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming that the generated code meets the expectations.
