/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error. The error occurs at line 8, where there is an unmatched '(' character. This is likely caused by incorrect placement or missing parentheses in the conditional statement. The original code uses a disjunction (;) for the coin flip outcome, while the generated code attempts to use an if-then-else construct (->) but fails to properly structure it. The generated code does not produce consistent results with the original code because it fails to run at all.
