/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause by using 'coin(C)' without properly grounding the variable C. This leads to a runtime error. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic coin flips by using the counter CNT as the coin identifier, ensuring all variables are properly grounded. The generated code also changes the logic by introducing 'heads' check, which was not present in the original code.
