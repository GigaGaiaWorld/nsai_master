/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code has several issues. First, it uses 'member/2' instead of 'my_member/2', which causes an error since 'member/2' is not defined. Second, there are syntax errors in the house predicates, such as 'house(norwegian, _, _, _, _)' which should be 'house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)'. These inconsistencies make the generated code invalid and unable to run successfully. The original code runs correctly and produces the expected result, while the generated code fails due to these errors.
