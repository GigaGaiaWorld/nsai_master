0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-
 
 M is N-1, between(1, M, I), pick(I, b), pick(I+1, b).
len(5).
evidence(palindrome(X)) :- len(X).
query(bb(X)) :- len(X).

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there is a significant difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code simplifies the calculation of 'II' by directly using 'I+1' in the 'pick' call, which is syntactically correct but alters the probability calculation. This change leads to a different result (0.6484 vs 0.3750) due to the modified probability distribution in the generated code.
