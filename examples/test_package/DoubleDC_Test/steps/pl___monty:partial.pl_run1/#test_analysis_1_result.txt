### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities are consistent with the expected behavior of the Monty Hall problem:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any of the three doors (`prize/1`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the original choice (`win_keep`) is 1/3.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is 2/3.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules adhere to the problem's requirements:
- **`open_door/1` Rules:**
  - Correctly handles cases where both unselected doors are empty (random selection) or one has a prize (selects the empty door).
- **`win_keep` and `win_switch`:**
  - Accurately reflect the winning conditions for the two strategies.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- Logical correctness is ensured:
  - The `member/2` predicate correctly iterates through the list of doors.
  - Recursive termination is guaranteed for `member/2`.
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- Probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined with equal probabilities.
- Negations (`\+ prize(A)`) comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.
- The host's behavior (`open_door/1`) adheres to the problem's rules.

**DeepProbLog Features:**
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `member/2`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `prize/1`, `open_door/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- No edge cases were overlooked:
  - All inputs are lists (`[1,2,3]`).
  - Recursion is well-behaved.
  - No undefined predicates.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and adheres to the Monty Hall problem's requirements. No errors or improvements are suggested.
