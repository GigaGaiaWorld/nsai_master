### Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`), which recursively splits a list into halves, sorts them, and merges the results. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully, producing the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `merge_sort/2` (lines 1–7)  
  - `split/3` (lines 8–10)  
  - `merge/3` (lines 11–16)  
  - `append/3` (lines 17–18)  
- **Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`), so no verification is required for probabilistic contexts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Analysis**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**:  
    The algorithm correctly implements the merge sort logic:  
    1. Splits the list into two halves (`split/3`).  
    2. Recursively sorts each half (`merge_sort/2`).  
    3. Merges the sorted halves (`merge/3`).  
  - **Recursive Termination**:  
    The recursion terminates because the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are correctly defined, and the list is progressively split into smaller sublists.  

- **ProbLog Analysis**:  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
    The code does not use neural network integration (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
    **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion may lead to stack overflow for very large lists, but this is inherent to Prolog's recursive nature.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error              | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists | Consider iterative solutions or tail recursion optimization. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and performance for large lists should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
