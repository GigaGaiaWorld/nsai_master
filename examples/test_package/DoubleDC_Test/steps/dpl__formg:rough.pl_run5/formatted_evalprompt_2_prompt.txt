</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`), which recursively splits a list into halves, sorts them, and merges the results. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully, producing the expected sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `merge_sort/2` (lines 1–7)  
  - `split/3` (lines 8–10)  
  - `merge/3` (lines 11–16)  
  - `append/3` (lines 17–18)  
- **Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`), so no verification is required for probabilistic contexts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Analysis**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**:  
    The algorithm correctly implements the merge sort logic:  
    1. Splits the list into two halves (`split/3`).  
    2. Recursively sorts each half (`merge_sort/2`).  
    3. Merges the sorted halves (`merge/3`).  
  - **Recursive Termination**:  
    The recursion terminates because the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are correctly defined, and the list is progressively split into smaller sublists.  

- **ProbLog Analysis**:  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
    The code does not use neural network integration (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
    **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion may lead to stack overflow for very large lists, but this is inherent to Prolog's recursive nature.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error              | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists | Consider iterative solutions or tail recursion optimization. |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and performance for large lists should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
