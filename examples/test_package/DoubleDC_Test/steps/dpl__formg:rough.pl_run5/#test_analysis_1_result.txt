### Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, aiming to sort a list of integers. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, analyzing test results, and ensuring compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards. The purpose is to identify any logical or probabilistic errors and assess edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**  
  The result `[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]` is incorrect for the input `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`. The expected sorted output should be `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`.  
  **Conclusion:** The test fails.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:**  
  `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  - **Actual Result:** `[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]`  
  - **Expected Result:** `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`  

- **Error Location:**  
  The error lies in the `merge/3` predicate (lines 10â€“17). The merging logic does not correctly handle the comparison and merging of sublists. Specifically, the conditions for merging (`LeftHead @=< RightHead` and `LeftHead @> RightHead`) are not producing the correct order.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
  - The `merge/3` predicate fails to maintain the sorted order during merging. The recursive termination is correct, but the merging logic is flawed.  
  - The `split/3` predicate correctly divides the list into two halves.  

- **ProbLog Analysis:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code. The result probability `1.0000` is irrelevant here as the logic is purely deterministic.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (incorrect merging logic).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** Not handled (e.g., `merge_sort(123, X)` would fail).  
  - **Empty List:** Correctly handled.  
  - **Single-element List:** Correctly handled.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for typical lists but may suffer for very large lists due to Prolog's stack limitations.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect merging logic in `merge/3` | Produces unsorted output        | Fix the merging conditions to ensure correct order. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list input    | Program crashes on invalid input | Add input validation.               |
| 3   | DeepProbLog features not used    | N/A                             | Not applicable for this evaluation. |

---

#### **Code Fix Suggestion**  
Here is the corrected `merge/3` predicate:  
```prolog
merge([], Right, Right).
merge(Left, [], Left).
merge([LeftHead|LeftTail], [RightHead|RightTail], [LeftHead|Merged]) :-
    LeftHead =< RightHead,
    merge(LeftTail, [RightHead|RightTail], Merged).
merge([LeftHead|LeftTail], [RightHead|RightTail], [RightHead|Merged]) :-
    LeftHead > RightHead,
    merge([LeftHead|LeftTail], RightTail, Merged).
```
