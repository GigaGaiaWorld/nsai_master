### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog (Hash: 418D2062)**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, adhering to classical logic programming principles. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior under test cases, and ensure compliance with functional requirements (interpretability, classical reasoning, and edge-case handling).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Test Query:**  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed successfully, producing the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/4`, and `merge/3` function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The algorithm correctly splits the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the list is split into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)`, `P(A⇒B)`).  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in Prolog.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic elements).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).  

**Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**  
1. **Non-list Input:**  
   - The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) will fail.  
2. **Performance:**  
   - Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow (Prolog's default stack limits).  
3. **Undefined Predicates:**  
   - The `append/3` predicate is defined but not explicitly required for `merge_sort/2`.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error              | Add input validation.               |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large N | Optimize tail recursion or use iterators. |
| 3      | Unused `append/3`        | Redundant code             | Remove or document its purpose.     |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases and performance optimizations should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
