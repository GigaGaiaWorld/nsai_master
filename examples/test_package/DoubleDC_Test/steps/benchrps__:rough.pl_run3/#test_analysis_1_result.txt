### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the game rules, the logic for determining the winner, and the scoring mechanism. The evaluation also ensures compliance with classical Prolog reasoning and ProbLog probabilistic rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The code was tested with the following query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
```
**Verification:**
- The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
  - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
  - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
  - `rock` vs `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
  - Net score: `-1` (Player 2 wins).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:
- `play_round/3`: Determines the outcome of a single round.
- `play/3`: Recursively processes lists of moves.
- `compute_score/2`: Calculates the cumulative score.
- `determine_winner/3`: Uses the above predicates to determine the winner.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `play_round/3` correctly model the game's win-lose relationships.
- **Recursive Termination:** The predicates `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminate correctly for finite lists.

**ProbLog Analysis:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Empty Lists:** Handled correctly by `play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`.
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for reasonable list lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No issues were found.
