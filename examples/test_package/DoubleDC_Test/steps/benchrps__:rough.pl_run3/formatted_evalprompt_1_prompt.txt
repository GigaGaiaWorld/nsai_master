</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the game rules, the logic for determining the winner, and the scoring mechanism. The evaluation also ensures compliance with classical Prolog reasoning and ProbLog probabilistic rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The code was tested with the following query:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
```
**Verification:**
- The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
  - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
  - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
  - `rock` vs `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
  - Net score: `-1` (Player 2 wins).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:
- `play_round/3`: Determines the outcome of a single round.
- `play/3`: Recursively processes lists of moves.
- `compute_score/2`: Calculates the cumulative score.
- `determine_winner/3`: Uses the above predicates to determine the winner.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `play_round/3` correctly model the game's win-lose relationships.
- **Recursive Termination:** The predicates `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminate correctly for finite lists.

**ProbLog Analysis:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Empty Lists:** Handled correctly by `play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`.
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for reasonable list lengths.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No issues were found.

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
