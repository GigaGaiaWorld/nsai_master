### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle that involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. This evaluation assesses the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on:
- Logical correctness of the rules and predicates.
- Verification of test results.
- Compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning (if applicable).
- Edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code was tested with the query `zebra(Houses)`, and the result was:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**: The output matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, confirming that the implementation is logically correct.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) function as intended.
- The expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are not used in this implementation, so their correctness is not applicable here.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness**: The rules for `my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3` are correctly defined and terminate properly. For example:
  - `my_member/2` recursively checks for membership in a list.
  - `right_of/3` ensures that one house is immediately to the right of another.
- **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates have base cases and properly reduce the problem size, ensuring termination.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required. The result is deterministic (probability `1.0000`).

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**
- **DeepProbLog feature not used**: The code does not involve neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) or probabilistic fusion.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

##### **Edge Cases and Pitfalls**
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are called.
- **Non-list Input**: The `houses/1` predicate ensures the input is a list of five houses, preventing non-list inputs.
- **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited (maximum of five houses), so performance is not an issue.
- **Missing Clauses**: All required clauses for the puzzle are included.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and robust for the given test case. All predicates are logically sound, and the solution adheres to the puzzle's constraints. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, simplifying the evaluation. The code handles edge cases well, and no improvements are necessary for the current requirements.
