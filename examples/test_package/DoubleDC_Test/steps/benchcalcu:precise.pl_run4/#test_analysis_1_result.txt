### Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The puzzle requires:  
1. Defining digits and ensuring the first digit of multi-digit numbers is not zero.  
2. Ensuring all letters represent unique digits.  
3. Performing column-wise addition with carry propagation.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following queries and their return values (all with a probability of 1.0000):  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9])`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0])`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8])`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1])`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2])`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6])`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8])`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5])`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7])`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9])`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the puzzle's requirements, and the constraints (e.g., `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, and `sumdigit/5`) are correctly enforced.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates (`digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, and `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
  - The recursive predicate `all_different/1` correctly ensures uniqueness by checking each element against the rest of the list.  
  - The `sumdigit/5` predicate accurately simulates column-wise addition with carry propagation.  
  - Termination is guaranteed as the recursion in `all_different/1` and `member/2` is bounded by the list length.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly implemented.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code handles edge cases such as multi-digit numbers not starting with zero and ensures all digits are unique.  
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
