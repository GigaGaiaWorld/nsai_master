### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Expression Parser**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Expression Parser for Arithmetic Operations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code defines a parser for arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `image_2`, `image_plus`). The parser evaluates expressions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using the `almost_equal/2` predicate to handle floating-point precision. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the parser, analyze its logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 5.66666666666667) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The query evaluates the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, which simplifies to `0.666... + 3 - 14 = -10.333...`. However, the result `5.666...` is incorrect.
  - **Conclusion:** The test fails due to an incorrect evaluation of the arithmetic expression.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query involving the expression `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7]`.
- **Expected Result:** `-10.333...`
- **Actual Result:** `5.666...`
- **Error Location:**
  - The error lies in the `parse/2` predicates, specifically in the handling of operator precedence. The current implementation does not respect the standard arithmetic precedence rules (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `parse/2` predicates process operations left-to-right without considering precedence. For example, `2 * 7` should be evaluated before `3 - 14`, but the current implementation evaluates `3 - 2` first.
- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The recursion in `parse/2` correctly terminates when the list is reduced to a single element.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`). The evaluation is purely deterministic.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs or undefined operations are not handled, which could lead to runtime errors.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The parser evaluates expressions but fails to respect operator precedence.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined operations or malformed input lists are not handled.
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the simplicity of the expressions.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong evaluation of expressions | Redesign `parse/2` to respect precedence   |
| 2      | No input validation              | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add checks for list structure and operators |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The parser fails to evaluate arithmetic expressions correctly due to the lack of operator precedence handling. The fix requires restructuring the `parse/2` predicates to prioritize multiplication and division over addition and subtraction. Additionally, input validation should be added to handle edge cases. The code does not utilize DeepProbLog features, and no probabilistic reasoning is involved.
