### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Expression Parser

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Expression Parser for Arithmetic Operations**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code defines a system for parsing arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `image_2`, `image_plus`). The system uses predicates like `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` to map images to their corresponding numbers and operators. The `parse/2` predicate recursively evaluates the arithmetic operations, ensuring correctness via the `almost_equal/2` predicate. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the logical correctness, probabilistic compliance (if any), and edge-case handling of the system.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The query evaluates the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, which simplifies to `0.666... + 3 - 14 = -10.333...`. However, the result `11.666...` is incorrect.
  - **Conclusion:** The test fails due to incorrect arithmetic evaluation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect result.
- **Expected Result:** `-10.333...`
- **Actual Result:** `11.666...`
- **Faulty Predicate:** The `parse/2` rules do not respect operator precedence (division/multiplication should precede addition/subtraction).
- **Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  parse([N1, +, N2 | T], R) :- 
      almost_equal(N1 + N2, Temp),
      parse([Temp | T], R).
  ```
  The issue arises because the parser evaluates operations left-to-right without considering precedence.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The parser fails to implement arithmetic operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluations.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly, but the intermediate results are flawed due to precedence issues.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so probabilistic compliance is not applicable.
- **DeepProbLog Integration:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The parser handles basic arithmetic but fails on precedence.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid images are not handled.
  - **Deep Recursion:** No performance issues observed, but incorrect results due to precedence.
  - **Operator Precedence:** Not implemented, leading to incorrect evaluations.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect operator precedence    | Arithmetic results are invalid  | Implement precedence rules in `parse/2`    |
| 2      | No edge-case handling            | Crashes on invalid inputs      | Add input validation                       |
| 3      | No probabilistic features        | Limited to classical reasoning | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed  |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The parser requires fixes for operator precedence and edge-case handling to meet functional requirements. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are currently used.
