### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, where two players submit lists of moves (`P1Moves` and `P2Moves`), and the winner is determined based on the results of each round. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog and ProbLog rules.
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
**Query Tested:**
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],'Player 2') = 1.0000
```
**Analysis:**
- The query correctly returns `'Player 2'` as the winner with a probability of `1.0000`.
- The result aligns with the expected outcome:
  - Round 1: `rock` vs `paper` → `lose` (Player 2 wins).
  - Round 2: `rock` vs `paper` → `lose` (Player 2 wins).
  - Round 3: `rock` vs `scissor` → `win` (Player 1 wins).
  - Total score: `-1` (Player 2 wins).

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:
- `move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3` function as intended.
- The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly handled.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for determining the winner (`result/3`) and calculating the score (`compute_score/2`) are logically sound.
- **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`) ensure termination.

**ProbLog Analysis:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is involved.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Uneven Lists:** If the lists are of unequal length, the behavior is undefined.
- **Undefined Moves:** Moves not listed in `move/1` (e.g., `spock`) would cause failures.

**Performance:**
- The recursion depth is linear with the length of the input lists, which is efficient for typical game lengths.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list inputs | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2      | Uneven lists | Undefined behavior | Ensure lists are of equal length or handle padding. |
| 3      | Undefined moves | Failure | Extend `move/1` or validate inputs. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Verdict:**  
The code is functionally correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog rules. However, edge cases like non-list inputs or undefined moves should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
