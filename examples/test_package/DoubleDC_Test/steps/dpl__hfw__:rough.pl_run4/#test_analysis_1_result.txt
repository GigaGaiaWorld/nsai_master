### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Evaluation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The expressions include numbers and operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The query evaluates the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, which simplifies to `0.666... + 3 - 14 = -10.333...`. However, the result `11.666...` is incorrect.
  - **Conclusion:** The test fails due to an incorrect evaluation of the arithmetic expression.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect result.
- **Expected Result:** `-10.333...`
- **Actual Result:** `11.666...`
- **Error Location:**
  - The issue lies in the `parse/2` predicates, specifically in the order of operations (operator precedence). The current implementation processes operations left-to-right without considering arithmetic precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `parse/2` predicates do not account for operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluations. For example, `2 * 7` should be evaluated before `3 - 14`, but the current implementation processes operations sequentially.
- **Recursive Termination:**
  - The recursion in `parse/2` terminates correctly when the list is reduced to a single element, but the intermediate steps are flawed due to incorrect precedence handling.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Features:**
  - **Not Used:** The code does not include any neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) or probabilistic reasoning beyond basic arithmetic.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code correctly parses and evaluates expressions but fails to handle operator precedence.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid symbols are not handled.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable for typical expressions but could be problematic for very long lists.
  - **Operator Precedence:** The most critical oversight is the lack of precedence handling.

| 1   | Incorrect operator precedence    | Wrong evaluation of expressions | Implement precedence rules in `parse/2`     |
| 2   | No input validation              | Crashes on invalid inputs       | Add checks for list structure and symbols   |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires modifications to handle operator precedence and input validation. The current implementation is suitable for simple left-to-right evaluations but fails for standard arithmetic expressions.
