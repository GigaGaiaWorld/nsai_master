### Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digits for the equation `AB + BCD = CDE`. The solution must adhere to the following constraints:  
1. The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
2. All letters must represent distinct digits.  
3. The addition must account for carry-over operations.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`. All solutions returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating successful execution.  

**Key Observations:**  
- All tests passed (no failures).  
- The results satisfy the constraints:  
  - No leading digit is 0.  
  - All digits in each solution are unique.  
  - The arithmetic operations (`sumdigit/5`) correctly handle carry-over.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, no failures were detected. The following predicates were verified:  
- `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`: Ensure valid digits and no leading zeros.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column addition with carry-over.  

No errors were found in the code or its expansion predicates.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `sumdigit/5` correctly handles both cases (sum < 10 and sum ≥ 10).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates as the list shrinks with each call.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (digits 0-9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the list length (5 digits), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct and robust for the given problem. No errors or improvements are required.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

    sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Carry1),
    sumdigit(Carry1, A, C, D, Carry2),
    sumdigit(Carry2, 0, B, C, Carry3),
    Carry3 = 0.
