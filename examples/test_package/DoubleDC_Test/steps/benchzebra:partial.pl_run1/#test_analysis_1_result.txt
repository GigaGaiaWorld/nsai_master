#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. This evaluation analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle to verify its correctness, adherence to requirements, and robustness in handling logical and probabilistic constraints.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code was tested with the following query and result:
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```

**Verification:**
- All constraints in the puzzle are satisfied by the output:
  - The owner of the red house is English.
  - The Spanish person has a dog.
  - The green house owner drinks coffee.
  - The snail owner smokes Winstons.
  - The middle house drinks milk.
  - The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
  - Someone has a zebra.
  - Some people drink water.

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output adheres to all specified requirements.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the output satisfies all constraints.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The implementation uses classical Prolog predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) to enforce the puzzle constraints. The recursive definitions of these predicates ensure termination and correctness.
  
- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  The result has a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic satisfaction of all constraints. No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation.

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly enforced using Prolog predicates.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The input is explicitly defined as a list of five houses, so non-list inputs are not a concern.
  - Recursive predicates (`right_of`, `next_to`, `my_member`) are well-defined and terminate correctly.
  - No undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and robust, satisfying all puzzle constraints without failures. The absence of probabilistic or DeepProbLog features limits its scope to classical reasoning. For future enhancements, consider integrating probabilistic facts or neural network outputs for more complex scenarios.
