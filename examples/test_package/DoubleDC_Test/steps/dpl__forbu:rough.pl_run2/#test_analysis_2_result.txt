### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning, as the code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for '!/0' at 6:5.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
  - **Expected Result:** A sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to undefined `!/0` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 6: `!` (cut operator) in the `bubblesort/3` predicate.  
  - **Issue:** The cut operator `!` is not recognized in ProbLog, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.  

- **Affected Predicate:**  
  - `bubblesort/3` (Lines 5â€“9).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**  
  - The `swap/4` predicate is logically correct for swapping elements in a list.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate attempts to use the cut operator `!` to enforce deterministic behavior, which is not supported in ProbLog.  

- **ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is tested.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion in `swap/4` and `bubblesort/3` is well-defined and terminates when the list is sorted.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (fails due to unsupported cut operator).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - The cut operator `!` is not supported in ProbLog, which is a critical oversight.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `!/0` in ProbLog | Program fails to execute        | Remove the cut operator or replace with ProbLog-compatible logic. |
| 2   | No edge case handling       | May crash on invalid inputs     | Add input validation for lists.     |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Conclusion:**  
The bubblesort implementation fails due to the unsupported cut operator in ProbLog. Addressing this issue and adding edge case handling would improve robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
