### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, with the goal of sorting a list of integers. The `forth_sort/2` predicate serves as a wrapper for the `bubblesort/3` predicate. The code was tested with the query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`, but an error was encountered during execution. This report analyzes the failure, its root cause, and provides suggestions for correction.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`.  
- **Result**: The test failed with the error:  
  ```  
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 5:19.  
  ```  
- **Expected Result**: The query should return the sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at line 5, column 19.  
- **Code Block with Error**:  
  ```prolog
  bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
      ( swap(L, L1) ->
          bubblesort(L1, [], Sorted)
      ; 
          append(Acc, L, Sorted)
      ).
  ```  
- **Issue**: The `->/2` operator (implication) is not correctly defined or recognized in the ProbLog context.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The `->/2` operator is valid in standard Prolog for conditional execution, but ProbLog may not support it directly.  
  - The recursive termination condition is correct (base case: `append(Acc, L, Sorted)`), but the conditional logic is not properly implemented.  

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - ProbLog does not natively support the `->/2` operator for probabilistic reasoning.  
  - The error suggests that the operator is not recognized, leading to the failure.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic for swapping and sorting is correct, but the conditional execution fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is manageable for small lists but may cause performance issues for large lists.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: The `->/2` operator is undefined in ProbLog.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `->/2` operator not recognized  | Conditional logic fails          | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if/3`).  |
| 2   | Non-list input not handled      | Runtime error for invalid input  | Add input validation to ensure the argument is a list.                     |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists  | Performance degradation          | Optimize the algorithm or add a recursion limit.                           |

---

#### **8. Suggested Corrections**  
Replace the `bubblesort/3` predicate with ProbLog-compatible logic:  
```prolog
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    ( swap(L, L1) ->
        bubblesort(L1, [], Sorted)
    ; 
        append(Acc, L, Sorted)
    ).
```  
**Correction**:  
```prolog
bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    ( swap(L, L1) ->
        bubblesort(L1, [], Sorted)
    ; 
        append(Acc, L, Sorted)
    ).
```

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The code fails due to the unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog. Correcting this and addressing edge cases will ensure robustness.
