### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code aims to implement an interpretable `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog. The goal is to sort a list of integers using the bubblesort algorithm. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`. However, the execution resulted in an error due to the absence of the `bubblesort/3` predicate. This report evaluates the code's correctness, identifies failures, and provides suggestions for improvement.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for 'bubblesort/3' at 3:21.
  ```  
- **Conclusion:** The test failed because the `bubblesort/3` predicate is not defined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs at line 3, where the `bubblesort/3` predicate is called but not defined.  
- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort(L,L2) :- bubblesort(L,[],L2).
  ```  
- **Issue:** The `bubblesort/3` predicate is missing, causing the program to fail.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**  
  - The `swap/4` predicate is correctly defined for swapping elements, but it is not integrated into a complete `bubblesort/3` algorithm.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate is required to implement the recursive sorting logic but is absent.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and does not involve probabilistic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used.  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (only `swap/4` is defined).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The input list is assumed to be valid, but non-list inputs or edge cases (e.g., empty lists) are not handled.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate is missing, which is critical for the algorithm.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1   | `bubblesort/3` predicate missing | Program fails to execute       | Implement the `bubblesort/3` logic |
| 2   | No edge case handling            | May fail for non-list inputs   | Add input validation               |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The provided code fails due to the absence of the `bubblesort/3` predicate, which is essential for the sorting algorithm. The `swap/4` predicate is correctly defined but unused. To fix this, implement the `bubblesort/3` logic and ensure edge cases are handled. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are involved in this scenario.
