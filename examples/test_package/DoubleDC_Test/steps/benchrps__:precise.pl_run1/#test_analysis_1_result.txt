### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog. The logic includes:
- Defining the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
- Establishing the win-lose relationships (`beats/2`).
- Calculating the result of each round (`result/3`).
- Recursively playing the game (`play/3`).
- Computing the final score (`compute_score/2`).
- Determining the winner (`determine_winner/3`).

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the logic, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided is:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Result:**
The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```

**Interpretation:**
The error indicates that the ProbLog engine could not find a clause for an empty predicate (`''->'/2`). This suggests a syntax or logical error in the code, likely related to the `determine_winner/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location:** Line 41, column 77.
- **Problematic Predicate:** `determine_winner/3`.
- **Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```

**Issue:**
The error suggests that the ProbLog engine encountered an unexpected symbol or incomplete clause. The likely cause is a missing or misplaced operator (e.g., `->` or `;`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context:**
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate is logically correct but may have a syntax error in the conditional statement (`->` and `;`).
  - The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined and terminate properly.
  
- **ProbLog Context:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic for game rules and scoring is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate fails due to a syntax error.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs for `play/3` or `compute_score/2` are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is acceptable for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner/3` | Test failure, unable to compute winner | Fix the conditional statement syntax in `determine_winner/3`. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation for lists.     |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the problematic `determine_winner/3` predicate with the following corrected version:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The code is logically sound but contains a syntax error in the `determine_winner/3` predicate. Once fixed, the game logic should work as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
