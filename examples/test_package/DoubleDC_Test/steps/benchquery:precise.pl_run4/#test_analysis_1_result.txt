### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Population Density Query

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division and ensures the density ratio is within a 5% margin. The evaluation verifies the correctness of the implementation and its adherence to the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population density, adhering to the 5% margin requirement.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the test cases validate their functionality.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that two distinct countries (`C1 \= C2`) are compared, and their densities satisfy the inequality `20 × D1 < 21 × D2` and `20 × D2 < 21 × D1`. This avoids division while approximating a 5% margin.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used in the provided code, so termination is not a concern.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population density.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`, `query_pop/1`) are defined and correctly implemented.  
- **Non-list Input:** The input format for `query_pop/1` is strictly enforced as a list `[C1, D1, C2, D2]`.  
- **Performance:** The code is efficient, with no deep recursion or performance bottlenecks.
