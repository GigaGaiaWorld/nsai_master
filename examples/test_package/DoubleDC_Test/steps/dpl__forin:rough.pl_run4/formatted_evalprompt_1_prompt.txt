</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify its correctness, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with the requirements of interpretability. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` and verifying the output.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list.  
- **Verification:** "All tests passed (no failures)."  

The test passed because the predicate correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm, recursively inserting each element into its appropriate position in the sorted sublist.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verification of Expansion Predicates:**  
  - The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**  
  - **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are logically correct. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], []).`).  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, ensuring termination for finite lists.  

- **ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so probabilistic correctness (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not applicable.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
  - **Performance:** The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Performance for large lists | Inefficient for large datasets  | Consider alternative algorithms (e.g., quicksort). |

---

#### **Code Block for Reference**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([Head|Tail], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(Tail, SortedTail),
    insert(Head, SortedTail, Sorted).
insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [X,Y|Ys]) :- X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :- X > Y, insert(X, Ys, Zs).
```

---

#### **Word Count**  
Approximately 400 words.  

--- 

This report confirms the correctness of the `insertion_sort/2` implementation while highlighting potential improvements for robustness and performance.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
