### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle that involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. This evaluation assesses the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on:
- Logical correctness of predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`).
- Verification of test results.
- Compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules (if applicable).
- Edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Executed**: `zebra(Houses)`.
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**: The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, satisfying all given constraints.  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. All predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.
- **Expansion Predicates**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features used).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:
  - **Logical Correctness**: The predicates are logically sound. For example:
    - `my_member/2` correctly implements list membership.
    - `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` accurately model spatial relationships.
  - **Recursive Termination**: All recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate as they reduce the problem size with each recursive call.
- **ProbLog Scenarios**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not applicable.
  - **DeepProbLog Features**: Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic elements).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Inputs**: The code assumes valid input (e.g., lists of houses). Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Performance**: Recursive predicates are efficient for small lists but may face performance issues with very large lists.
  - **Missing Constraints**: The puzzle constraints are exhaustive, but additional edge cases (e.g., invalid house attributes) are not handled.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and robust for the given problem. All predicates are logically sound, and the test results confirm the solution's accuracy. While the code does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features or DeepProbLog, it serves as a valid example of classical logic programming. Future enhancements could include handling invalid inputs or extending the puzzle with probabilistic constraints.
