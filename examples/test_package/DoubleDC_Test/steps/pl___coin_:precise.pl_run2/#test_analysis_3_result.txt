#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Program: Functional and Probabilistic Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog program models a coin-tossing scenario where a counter (`CNT`) decrements from 4 to 0. At each step, the program checks if the `CNT`-th coin lands heads (with probability 0.8) and accumulates the count of successes (`SC`). The final result (`S`) represents the total number of heads observed. The program is tested with the query `total(_)`, and the results are compared against expected probabilistic outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `total(4) = 0.4096`
- `total(3) = 0.4096`
- `total(2) = 0.1536`
- `total(1) = 0.0256`
- `total(0) = 0.0016`

**Verification:**
- The results align with the binomial distribution for 4 trials with success probability 0.8:
  - `P(4 heads) = 0.8^4 = 0.4096`
  - `P(3 heads) = C(4,3) * 0.8^3 * 0.2 = 0.4096`
  - `P(2 heads) = C(4,2) * 0.8^2 * 0.2^2 = 0.1536`
  - `P(1 head) = C(4,1) * 0.8 * 0.2^3 = 0.0256`
  - `P(0 heads) = 0.2^4 = 0.0016`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The program correctly implements the recursive logic and probabilistic reasoning.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly decrements `CNT` and updates `SC` based on the outcome of `coin(CNT)`.
- **Termination:** The base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)` ensures termination when `CNT` reaches 0.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8)` correctly assigns a probability of 0.8 to each coin toss.
- **Negation Handling:** The use of `\+ coin(CNT)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` (i.e., `P(tails) = 0.2`).
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The program correctly implements recursive counting.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The results match the expected binomial distribution.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this program.
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable (input is numeric).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (4 steps), so performance is not an issue.
