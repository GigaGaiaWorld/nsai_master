  "ErrorSummary": "Timeout during execution due to potential infinite recursion in prove/1 and lack of termination guards. No probabilistic rules are used, limiting functionality.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add termination checks to prove/1 (e.g., depth limiting). 2. Include probabilistic facts/rules for ProbLog compliance. 3. Optimize list operations in includes/2 and extend/3.",
