### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle, focusing on:
- **Test Results Verification**: Ensuring all constraints are satisfied.
- **Failure Localization**: Identifying any discrepancies between expected and actual results.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Checking logical and probabilistic correctness.
- **Overall Analysis**: Assessing functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code was tested with the following result:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**: The output satisfies all the given constraints (e.g., the owner of the red house is English, the Spanish has a dog, etc.). The probability of 1.0000 indicates certainty in the solution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**: All constraints are correctly implemented and satisfied in the output. The predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are correctly defined and used.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:
  - **Logical Correctness**: The predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are logically sound and terminate correctly.
  - **Recursive Termination**: The recursive definitions (e.g., `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) terminate as they reduce the list size in each step.
  
- **ProbLog Scenarios**:
  - **Probabilistic Facts**: No probabilistic facts are used in this implementation. The solution is deterministic.
  - **DeepProbLog**: The code does not use any neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not used in the code.
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Houses` is a list of 5 elements. No checks for invalid input.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and satisfies all given constraints. The solution is deterministic and does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. No edge cases or failures were identified. The code is robust for the given problem scope.
