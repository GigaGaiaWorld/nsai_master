<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle, focusing on:
- **Test Results Verification**: Ensuring all constraints are satisfied.
- **Failure Localization**: Identifying any discrepancies between expected and actual results.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Checking logical and probabilistic correctness.
- **Overall Analysis**: Assessing functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code was tested with the following result:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**: The output satisfies all the given constraints (e.g., the owner of the red house is English, the Spanish has a dog, etc.). The probability of 1.0000 indicates certainty in the solution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**: All constraints are correctly implemented and satisfied in the output. The predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are correctly defined and used.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:
  - **Logical Correctness**: The predicates (`my_member`, `right_of`, `next_to`) are logically sound and terminate correctly.
  - **Recursive Termination**: The recursive definitions (e.g., `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) terminate as they reduce the list size in each step.
  
- **ProbLog Scenarios**:
  - **Probabilistic Facts**: No probabilistic facts are used in this implementation. The solution is deterministic.
  - **DeepProbLog**: The code does not use any neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not used in the code.
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes `Houses` is a list of 5 elements. No checks for invalid input.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and satisfies all given constraints. The solution is deterministic and does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. No edge cases or failures were identified. The code is robust for the given problem scope. 

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
