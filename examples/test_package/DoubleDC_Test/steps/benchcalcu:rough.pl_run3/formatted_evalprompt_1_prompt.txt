<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The goal is to ensure the code correctly enforces constraints (e.g., unique digits, no leading zeros) and produces valid solutions. This report evaluates the code's correctness, test results, and adherence to ProbLog principles.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following solutions, all with a probability of `1.0000`:  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9])`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0])`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8])`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1])`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2])`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6])`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8])`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5])`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7])`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9])`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The solutions satisfy the constraints of the puzzle (unique digits, no leading zeros, and correct arithmetic).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures no leading zeros.  
- `all_different/1`: Enforces uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Simulates column addition with carry.  
- `query_sum/1`: Combines constraints to solve the puzzle.  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `member/2`, `digit/1`) are correctly defined and used.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to the puzzle's logical constraints. Recursive predicates (e.g., `all_different/1`) terminate correctly.  
- **Arithmetic:** The `sumdigit/5` predicate correctly handles carry propagation and digit sums.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (0–9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not an issue.  

**Suggestions:**  
- Add input validation for robustness.  
- Consider extending the puzzle to include probabilistic constraints for ProbLog features.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

--- 

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is correct and meets the puzzle's requirements. No failures or issues were detected. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic or neural network features to leverage ProbLog's full capabilities.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
