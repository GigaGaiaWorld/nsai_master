### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The puzzle must adhere to the following constraints:  
1. The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
2. All letters must represent distinct digits.  
3. The addition must account for carry-over operations.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])` returned a probability of `0.0000`, indicating no valid solutions were found. This suggests a failure in the code's logic or constraints.

**Failed Query:**  
- `query_sum([X6, X7, X8, X9, X10]) = 0.0000`  

**Expected Result:**  
At least one valid assignment of digits to `[A,B,C,D,E]` should satisfy the puzzle, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]` (hypothetical example).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failure occurs in the `query_sum` predicate, specifically in the constraints or the `sumdigit` calculations. The problematic code block is:  
```prolog
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
    leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C),
    all_different([A,B,C,D,E]),
    sumdigit(0, B, D, E, C1),
    sumdigit(C1, A, C, D, C2),
    sumdigit(0, B, C2, C, 0).
```

**Potential Issues:**  
1. **`sumdigit` Constraints:** The carry-over logic or digit assignments may be incorrect.  
2. **`all_different`:** The predicate might not enforce uniqueness correctly.  
3. **`leftdigit`:** The constraint on the first digit may be overly restrictive.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `sumdigit` predicate correctly models column addition with carry-over, but the constraints in `query_sum` may not align with the puzzle's requirements.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different` predicate is correctly implemented and terminates for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The result `0.0000` implies no valid assignments satisfy the constraints. This could be due to overly strict constraints or incorrect arithmetic.  
- No probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are used, so the issue lies in classical reasoning.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints or arithmetic logic is flawed.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid digits are not handled.  
- **Performance:** The `all_different` predicate may become inefficient for larger puzzles.

| 1  | No valid solutions found         | Puzzle unsolved                 | Re-examine `sumdigit` constraints   |
| 2  | `all_different` may be redundant | Unnecessary computation         | Optimize uniqueness checks          |

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Conclusion:**  
The code fails to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle due to logical constraints or arithmetic errors in the `query_sum` predicate. Recommendations include revisiting the `sumdigit` logic and testing with simpler cases to isolate the issue. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are involved.
