### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle `AB + BCD = CDE` under the following constraints:  
1. Each letter represents a unique digit (0â€“9).  
2. The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
3. The addition must account for carry-over operations.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])` returned a probability of `0.0000`, indicating no valid solutions were found. This suggests a failure in the code's ability to satisfy the puzzle's constraints.

- **Query:** `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`  
  **Result:** `0.0000` (No valid solutions found).  

**Conclusion:** The test failed to produce a valid solution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failure occurs in the `query_sum` predicate, which is responsible for enforcing the puzzle's constraints and performing the addition. The specific issues are:  
1. **Constraint Enforcement:** The `all_different` predicate ensures uniqueness, but the `sumdigit` predicates may not correctly handle the carry-over logic.  
2. **Carry Logic:** The `sumdigit` rules may not account for all possible carry scenarios, leading to no valid solutions.  

**Code Block with Issue:**  
```prolog
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
    leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C),
    all_different([A,B,C,D,E]),
    sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Carry1),
    sumdigit(Carry1, A, C, D, Carry2),
    sumdigit(0, B, Carry2, C, _).
```

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `sumdigit` predicate is designed to handle single-digit addition with carry, but the recursive application of `sumdigit` in `query_sum` may not align with the puzzle's requirements.  
  - The `all_different` constraint is correctly implemented, but the addition logic fails to produce valid digit assignments.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The result `0.0000` indicates that no probabilistic facts or rules were satisfied. This suggests the classical logic is flawed, as no valid assignments were found.  

- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **Not Used:** The code does not utilize any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The uniqueness and digit constraints are enforced, but the addition logic fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as no probabilistic facts are used.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs but does not handle non-list inputs.  
  - **Performance:** The recursive `all_different` predicate may become inefficient for larger puzzles.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `sumdigit` logic incorrect       | No valid solutions found       | Revise `sumdigit` to handle all carry cases. |
| 2      | `query_sum` constraints too strict | Over-constrains the puzzle     | Relax constraints or debug addition logic. |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features used     | Limited to classical reasoning | Consider integrating neural networks if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires revision to correctly handle the cryptoaddition logic. Focus on debugging the `sumdigit` and `query_sum` predicates to ensure valid solutions are generated.
