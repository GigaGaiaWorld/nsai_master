  "ErrorSummary": "The query_sum predicate fails to find valid solutions due to incorrect constraints or arithmetic logic in the sumdigit calls. The all_different and leftdigit constraints are correctly implemented but may not align with the puzzle's requirements.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Re-examine the sumdigit constraints in query_sum to ensure they correctly model the addition AB + BCD = CDE. Specifically, verify the carry-over logic and digit assignments. For example, the third sumdigit call should likely involve the carry from the previous addition and the digits A, B, and C.",
