<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle `AB + BCD = CDE` under the following constraints:  
1. Each letter represents a unique digit (0–9).  
2. The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
3. The addition must account for carry-over operations.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])` returned a probability of `0.0000`, indicating no valid solutions were found. This suggests a failure in the code's ability to satisfy the puzzle's constraints.

- **Query:** `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`  
  **Result:** `0.0000` (No valid solutions found).  

**Conclusion:** The test failed to produce a valid solution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failure occurs in the `query_sum` predicate, which is responsible for enforcing the puzzle's constraints and performing the addition. The specific issues are:  
1. **Constraint Enforcement:** The `all_different` predicate ensures uniqueness, but the `sumdigit` predicates may not correctly handle the carry-over logic.  
2. **Carry Logic:** The `sumdigit` rules may not account for all possible carry scenarios, leading to no valid solutions.  

**Code Block with Issue:**  
```prolog
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
    leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C),
    all_different([A,B,C,D,E]),
    sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Carry1),
    sumdigit(Carry1, A, C, D, Carry2),
    sumdigit(0, B, Carry2, C, _).
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `sumdigit` predicate is designed to handle single-digit addition with carry, but the recursive application of `sumdigit` in `query_sum` may not align with the puzzle's requirements.  
  - The `all_different` constraint is correctly implemented, but the addition logic fails to produce valid digit assignments.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The result `0.0000` indicates that no probabilistic facts or rules were satisfied. This suggests the classical logic is flawed, as no valid assignments were found.  

- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **Not Used:** The code does not utilize any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The uniqueness and digit constraints are enforced, but the addition logic fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as no probabilistic facts are used.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs but does not handle non-list inputs.  
  - **Performance:** The recursive `all_different` predicate may become inefficient for larger puzzles.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `sumdigit` logic incorrect       | No valid solutions found       | Revise `sumdigit` to handle all carry cases. |
| 2      | `query_sum` constraints too strict | Over-constrains the puzzle     | Relax constraints or debug addition logic. |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features used     | Limited to classical reasoning | Consider integrating neural networks if needed. |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires revision to correctly handle the cryptoaddition logic. Focus on debugging the `sumdigit` and `query_sum` predicates to ensure valid solutions are generated.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
