### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities align with the expected behavior of the Monty Hall problem:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any door (`prize/1`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is 1/3.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is 2/3.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation correctly models the problem's requirements:
- The host's behavior (opening doors) is accurately represented in the rules for `open_door/1`.
- The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) and deterministic facts (`select_door/1`) are correctly defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- Logical correctness is ensured by the recursive `member/2` predicate, which terminates for finite lists.
- The rules for `open_door/1` correctly handle edge cases (e.g., only one unselected door without a prize).

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` sum to 1, complying with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.
- The host's random choice between two empty doors (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`) adheres to fairness.

**DeepProbLog:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules for `open_door/1` and `member/2` are logically sound.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for `prize/1` and `open_door/1` are correctly computed.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- The implementation handles cases where only one unselected door is empty.
- The use of `member/2` ensures robustness against non-list inputs (though not explicitly tested).

**Performance:**
- The recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not a concern.

**Code Blocks:**
```prolog
% Correctly models the host's random choice between two empty doors
0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    A < B,
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ prize(B),
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ select_door(B).
```

```prolog
% Correctly handles the case where only one unselected door is empty
open_door(A) :-
    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ (member(B, [1,2,3]), B \= A, \+ prize(B), \+ select_door(B)).
