### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle that involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. This evaluation assesses the correctness and robustness of the provided ProbLog implementation, focusing on:
- Logical correctness of the predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`).
- Verification of test results.
- Compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules (if applicable).
- Edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test result for the query `zebra(Houses)` is as follows:
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures)**. The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, confirming that the implementation is logically correct.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected**. All predicates (`my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, `right_of/3`) are correctly defined and function as intended.
- **Code Verification**:
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly checks adjacency using `right_of/3`.
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly checks if one element is immediately to the right of another in a list.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:
  - The predicates are logically sound and terminate correctly due to proper recursive definitions (e.g., `right_of/3` and `my_member/2`).
  - No infinite recursion or logical inconsistencies are present.
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:
  - The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog rules.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this implementation.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Non-list Input**: The predicates assume list inputs, but no checks are in place for invalid inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.
  - **Undefined Predicates**: All required predicates are defined.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Conclusion**
The provided ProbLog implementation of the Zebra Puzzle is correct and passes all tests. The predicates are logically sound, and the solution adheres to the puzzle's constraints. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, and edge cases are minimal due to the fixed problem scope. For future enhancements, input validation could be added to handle non-list inputs gracefully.
