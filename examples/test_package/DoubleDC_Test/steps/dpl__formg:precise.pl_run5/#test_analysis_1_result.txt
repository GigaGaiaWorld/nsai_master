### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to requirements, and ensure it handles edge cases and probabilistic scenarios appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Length Check:** The `length(List, Len)` predicate ensures recursive boundary conditions are met.  
2. **Splitting:** The `split_list/3` predicate correctly divides the list into two sublists.  
3. **Recursive Sorting and Merging:** The recursive calls to `merge_sort/2` and `merge/3` function as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation correctly follows the merge sort algorithm:  
  - Base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are handled.  
  - Recursive splitting and merging are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates as the list is split until its length is ≤ 1.  

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not use neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement | Status | Explanation |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Classical Reasoning | Met | Correctly implements merge sort. |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts/rules used. |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Applicable | No DeepProbLog features used. |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion could be inefficient for very large lists, but this is inherent to the algorithm.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | No probabilistic features used | Limited to classical Prolog | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |
| 3 | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural network support | Incorporate `nn/3` for hybrid reasoning. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is correct for classical Prolog scenarios and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks features for probabilistic reasoning and neural network integration, limiting its applicability in advanced ProbLog use cases. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
