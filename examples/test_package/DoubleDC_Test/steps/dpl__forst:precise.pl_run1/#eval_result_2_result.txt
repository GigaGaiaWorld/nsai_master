  "ErrorSummary": "Operator priority clash due to incomplete/malformed 'sort' predicate. The parser cannot resolve the syntax at line 9, column 44.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Complete the 'sort' predicate by ensuring proper syntax and operator precedence. For example, ensure the clause body is properly terminated with a period and the logic is correctly structured. The current implementation should be revised to handle the sorting of the top three elements and the base case for stacks with fewer than three elements.",
