### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic rules, and ensure it meets the specified functional requirements. The evaluation also checks for edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` function as intended:  
- `insertion_sort/2` recursively sorts the tail of the list and inserts the head into the sorted tail.  
- `insert_element/3` correctly places the element in the sorted list based on comparison.  

**Code Line Numbers:**  
- `insertion_sort/2`: Lines 1–3  
- `insert_element/3`: Lines 4–8  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation adheres to the insertion sort algorithm. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved in this query. The code behaves purely deterministically.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...`, or related calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements insertion sort.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases and Pitfalls:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Deep Recursion:** For very large lists, the recursive implementation may cause stack overflow.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion risk      | Stack overflow for large lists   | Consider iterative implementation.  |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The insertion sort implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog logic. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
