</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog: Logical Correctness and Probabilistic Compliance**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog program implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) and includes a test query to verify its functionality. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog and ProbLog requirements.  
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query Tested:**  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  
- The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic correctness.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are correctly defined and function as intended.  
- No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this code, so their correctness is not applicable here.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) correctly handles empty lists.  
  - The recursive case (`insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted)`) splits the list and inserts the head into the sorted tail, adhering to the insertion sort algorithm.  
  - The `insert/3` predicate correctly places elements in ascending order.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates when the input list is empty, ensuring no infinite loops.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The result `1.0000` indicates a deterministic outcome, as no probabilistic facts or rules are used.  
- No violations of probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are present.  

**DeepProbLog Analysis:**  
- **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  
- No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The program does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow, though this is unlikely for typical use cases.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error              | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow   | Optimize for large lists if needed. |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Notes:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is logically correct and passes all provided tests. However, edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
