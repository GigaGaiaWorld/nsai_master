  "HASH": "DA97FB01",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. The code correctly implements insertion sort and passes the test case. However, edge cases (non-list inputs, deep recursion) are not handled.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`) to handle non-list inputs. 2. Consider tail-recursive optimization for large lists.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
