### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The ProbLog code provided simulates this scenario, with queries to evaluate the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning.  
- Ensure the implementation meets the functional requirements.  
- Identify any logical or probabilistic errors.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (each door has an equal chance of hiding the prize).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities align with the theoretical solution (1/3 for keeping, 2/3 for switching).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- The `open_door/1` rule correctly handles the case where both unselected doors are empty, opening one randomly.  
- The `win_keep` and `win_switch` predicates accurately reflect the contestant's choices.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined for list membership checks.  
- Recursion in `member/2` terminates properly.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` sum to 1, adhering to probabilistic rules.  
- The negation `\+ prize(A)` is correctly handled as `1 - P(prize(A))`.  
- The `open_door/1` rule ensures that only valid doors (not selected and not hiding the prize) are opened.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic for door selection and prize placement is sound.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and aligned with theory.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `select_door/1` is always called with a valid door number).  
- No performance issues are observed due to the simplicity of the problem.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified.
