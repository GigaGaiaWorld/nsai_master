### Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules.
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic and correct.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the expected probabilities (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:
1. **Uniform Random Opening:** When two doors are available, Monty opens one uniformly at random (handled by `findall` and `length` checks).
2. **Forced Opening:** When only one door is available, Monty must open it (implicitly handled by the logic).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `member/2` predicate and recursive logic are correct.
- **Termination:** Recursion in `member/2` terminates as the list is finite.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The `prize/1` facts are correctly defined with uniform probabilities.
- **Negations:** The use of `\+` (negation) complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.
- **Implications:** The logic for `open_door/1` correctly implements the problem's rules.

**DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Satisfied (e.g., `member/2` and deterministic `select_door/1`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Satisfied (correct handling of probabilities and negations).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** Not explicitly handled, but the problem context ensures list inputs.
- **Deep Recursion:** Not an issue due to small input size.
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.

    select_door(Selected),
    member(Door, [1,2,3]),
    \+ prize(Door),
    \+ (Door = Selected),
    findall(OtherDoor, (member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]), \+ prize(OtherDoor), \+ (OtherDoor = Selected), OtherDoor \= Door), Doors),
    length(Doors, 2),
    member(Door, Doors),
    0.5::open_door(Door).
