</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Algorithm in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, termination, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  `query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).`  
- **Result:**  
  `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The query successfully sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `swap/4`, `bubble/3`, and `bubblesort/3` function as intended.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `swap(X, Y, Y, X) :- X > Y.`  
- `swap(X, Y, X, Y) :- X =< Y.`  
- `bubble([X], [], X).`  
- `bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :- swap(H1, H2, X1, X2), bubble([X2 | T], T1, X).`  
- `bubblesort([], L, L).`  
- `bubblesort(L, L3, Sorted) :- bubble(L, L2, X), bubblesort(L2, [X | L3], Sorted).`  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The algorithm correctly implements bubblesort by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order and recursively sorting the remaining list.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`bubblesort([], L, L).`), ensuring no infinite loops.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved in this query.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm sorts the list deterministically.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this test case.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Empty List:** The code correctly handles empty lists (`bubblesort([], L, L).`).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may impact performance for very large lists, but this is inherent to bubblesort.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add input validation for lists.    |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Performance bottleneck     | Consider iterative implementation. |

---

**Word Count:** 450 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The bubblesort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and performance for large lists should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized in this example.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
