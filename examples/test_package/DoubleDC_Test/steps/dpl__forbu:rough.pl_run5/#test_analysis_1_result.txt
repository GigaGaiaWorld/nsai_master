### Code Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Algorithm in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, termination, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  `query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).`  
- **Result:**  
  `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The query successfully sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `swap/4`, `bubble/3`, and `bubblesort/3` function as intended.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `swap(X, Y, Y, X) :- X > Y.`  
- `swap(X, Y, X, Y) :- X =< Y.`  
- `bubble([X], [], X).`  
- `bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :- swap(H1, H2, X1, X2), bubble([X2 | T], T1, X).`  
- `bubblesort([], L, L).`  
- `bubblesort(L, L3, Sorted) :- bubble(L, L2, X), bubblesort(L2, [X | L3], Sorted).`

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The algorithm correctly implements bubblesort by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order and recursively sorting the remaining list.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`bubblesort([], L, L).`), ensuring no infinite loops.  

**ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved in this query.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm sorts the list deterministically.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this test case.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Empty List:** The code correctly handles empty lists (`bubblesort([], L, L).`).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may impact performance for very large lists, but this is inherent to bubblesort.

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add input validation for lists.    |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Performance bottleneck     | Consider iterative implementation. |

**Word Count:** 450 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The bubblesort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and performance for large lists should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized in this example.
