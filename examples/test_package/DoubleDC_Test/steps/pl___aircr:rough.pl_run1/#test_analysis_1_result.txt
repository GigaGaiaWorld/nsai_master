### Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of a flap from an initial position to a goal position, considering actuator strength, wind effects, and potential overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with probabilistic and classical Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure during evaluation. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 33:193.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The error occurs during the evaluation of the `attempted_flap_position/2` predicate, specifically at line 33. The system cannot find clauses for the `->/2` operator, which is used in the conditional logic of the predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `attempted_flap_position/2`
- **Code Line:** 33 (as indicated in the error message)
- **Issue:** The error suggests that the conditional operator `->/2` is not being processed correctly. This could be due to a syntax error or an unsupported operator in the ProbLog version being used.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicate `attempted_flap_position/2` is intended to calculate the new flap position based on the previous position, actuator strength, wind effect, and goal direction. The logic appears sound, but the implementation of the conditional (`->/2`) is problematic.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code uses probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind/1`, `wind_effect/2`) correctly, and the negation (`\+`) is used appropriately. However, the error is unrelated to probabilistic reasoning.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic for flap movement is correct, but the implementation fails due to a syntax issue.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for wind and actuator selection.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code does not handle cases where the wind effect or actuator strength might lead to an invalid position (e.g., negative values or values beyond the legal range).
  - The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition, but the error prevents further evaluation.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `->/2` operator | Prevents evaluation of the entire model | Replace the `->/2` operator with a supported conditional construct or update the ProbLog version. |
| 2   | Edge cases not handled          | Potential runtime errors       | Add checks for invalid positions and ensure all inputs are within legal bounds. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Conclusion:** The code has a critical syntax error that prevents its evaluation. Addressing the `->/2` operator issue and handling edge cases will improve robustness. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented, but classical reasoning is incomplete due to the error.
