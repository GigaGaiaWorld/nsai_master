### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, where two players' moves are compared to determine the winner. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with classical Prolog and ProbLog requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate**:  
  `determine_winner/3`  
  **Error Location**: Line 41, column 77.  
  **Issue**: The predicate definition is incomplete or malformed. The error suggests a missing or incorrect operator (`->`).

- **Code Block with Error**:
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves,P2Moves,Winner) :- play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), compute_score(Results, Score), (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
  The issue lies in the improper use of the conditional operator (`->`). The parentheses and semicolons are not correctly structured.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The logic for determining the winner is sound, but the implementation is flawed due to incorrect syntax in the conditional statement.
  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined and terminate as expected.

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so no probabilistic analysis is required. The error is purely syntactic.

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic is correct, but the implementation fails due to syntax errors.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - The `determine_winner` predicate fails due to syntax issues.  
  - Deep recursion is not a concern here due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` | Predicate fails to execute      | Correct the conditional statement syntax in `determine_winner`.            |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves`.                          |
| 3   | No probabilistic features used   | Limited to classical reasoning  | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed (e.g., weighted moves).          |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The code is conceptually correct but fails due to a syntactic error in the `determine_winner` predicate. Once fixed, it should work as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the analysis is limited to classical Prolog. Addressing the syntax error and edge cases will improve robustness.
