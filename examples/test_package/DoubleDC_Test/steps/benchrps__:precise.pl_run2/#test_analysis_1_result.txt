### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical Prolog and ProbLog requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or predicate definition issue in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`
- **Error Location:** Line 41, column 77.
- **Root Cause:** The error suggests a missing or malformed predicate definition. The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, where the syntax is incorrect or incomplete.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context:**
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate is not correctly defined. The current implementation lacks proper syntax (e.g., missing parentheses or incorrect operator usage).
  - The recursive termination in `compute_score/2` is correct, but the error prevents the predicate from being executed.
- **ProbLog Context:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The core logic for determining round results (`result/3`) and computing scores (`compute_score/2`) is correct, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate is flawed.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but appears correct.
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate is incomplete, leading to runtime errors.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Malformed `determine_winner/3`   | Prevents game outcome calculation | Correct the predicate definition, ensuring proper syntax and logic flow. |
| 2      | No error handling for non-lists  | May cause runtime errors       | Add input validation for list types.                                      |
| 3      | DeepProbLog not used             | Limited to classical reasoning | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed.                                |

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Fix `determine_winner/3`:**
   ```prolog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
       compute_score(Results, Score),
       (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
        Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
        Winner = 'Draw').
   ```
2. **Add Input Validation:**
   Ensure `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
3. **Extend for Probabilistic Use:**
   If probabilistic reasoning is desired, add probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., uncertain moves).

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation has logical flaws in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, but the core game logic is sound. Fixing the syntax and adding input validation will resolve the issues.
