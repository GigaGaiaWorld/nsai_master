### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog, defining the rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and scoring. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure it meets functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins (beats(paper, rock)).
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins again.
    - `rock` vs `scissor`: Player 1 wins (beats(rock, scissor)).
  - The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates and rules function as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Analysis:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `result/3` are correctly defined. The recursive `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates terminate correctly.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.
- **ProbLog Analysis:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes lists as input. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **8. Code Blocks**
```prolog
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(paper, rock).
beats(scissor, paper).

% Calculate the result of the game
result(X, X, draw) :- move(X).
result(X, Y, win) :- beats(X, Y).
result(X, Y, lose) :- beats(Y, X).

% Recursive play and score computation
play([], [], []).
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
    result(P1, P2, R),
    play(P1T, P2T, Rs).

compute_score([], 0).
compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The implementation is correct and meets the requirements for classical reasoning in ProbLog. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be handled in future iterations. The code is concise and logically sound. 

**Word Count:** ~400 words.
