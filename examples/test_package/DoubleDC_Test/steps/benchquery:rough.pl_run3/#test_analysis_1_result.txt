### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Population Density Query

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within a 5% margin). The code defines a `density/2` predicate to calculate density and a `query_pop/1` predicate to find matching pairs. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results show the following queries and their probabilities:
```prolog
query_pop([china, 2.440828402366864, france, 2.464788732394366]) = 1.0000
query_pop([indonesia, 2.23859649122807, pakistan, 2.192926045016077]) = 1.0000
query_pop([pakistan, 2.192926045016077, indonesia, 2.23859649122807]) = 1.0000
query_pop([mexico, 0.760471204188482, ethiopia, 0.777142857142857]) = 1.0000
query_pop([italy, 4.775862068965517, philippines, 4.611111111111111]) = 1.0000
query_pop([france, 2.464788732394366, china, 2.440828402366864]) = 1.0000
query_pop([philippines, 4.611111111111111, italy, 4.775862068965517]) = 1.0000
query_pop([ethiopia, 0.777142857142857, mexico, 0.760471204188482]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the `query_pop/1` predicate correctly identifies pairs of countries with population densities differing by no more than 5%.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** All queries returned the expected results with a probability of 1.0000, indicating perfect matches.
- **Expansion Predicates:** The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`), so this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates population density using `Pop / Area`.
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that `Country1` and `Country2` are distinct and their densities differ by ≤ 5%.
  - No recursive predicates are used, so termination is not an issue.
- **ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so probabilistic implications (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are not applicable.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the logic to query and compare population densities.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid country names and numeric values for `pop/2` and `area/2`. Undefined inputs would cause failures.
  - **Non-list Input:** The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list. Non-list inputs would fail.
  - **Performance:** The current implementation is efficient for the given dataset but may slow down with significantly larger datasets due to the quadratic complexity of comparing all pairs.

**Final Remarks:** The code meets all specified requirements and passes all tests. No issues were identified in the classical reasoning implementation. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features if needed.
