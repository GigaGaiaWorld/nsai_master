### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The code was tested with the query:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly defined and executed as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation adheres to the merge sort algorithm:
  1. **Splitting:** The `split_list/3` predicate correctly divides the list into two halves.
  2. **Recursive Sorting:** The `merge_sort/2` predicate recursively sorts the sublists.
  3. **Merging:** The `merge/3` predicate combines the sorted sublists.
- **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) ensure termination.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- The test case does not involve probabilistic facts or rules. The result is deterministic (`1.0000`), confirming classical behavior.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The merge sort algorithm is correctly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (`DeepProbLog` feature not used).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List:** Handled by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.
- **Single-element List:** Handled by the base case `merge_sort([X], [X])`.
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may cause stack overflow in some Prolog implementations.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion risk         | Stack overflow for large lists  | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The merge sort implementation in ProbLog is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may face performance issues with very large lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this example.
