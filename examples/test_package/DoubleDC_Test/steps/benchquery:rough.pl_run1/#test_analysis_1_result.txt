### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Population Density Query**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within a 5% margin). The code defines a `density/2` predicate to calculate the density and a `query_pop/1` predicate to find matching pairs. The evaluation verifies the correctness of the implementation and its adherence to probabilistic and classical Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the following queries and their return values (all with a probability of 1.0000):

1. `query_pop([china, 2.440828402366864, france, 2.464788732394366])`
2. `query_pop([indonesia, 2.23859649122807, pakistan, 2.192926045016077])`
3. `query_pop([pakistan, 2.192926045016077, indonesia, 2.23859649122807])`
4. `query_pop([mexico, 0.760471204188482, ethiopia, 0.777142857142857])`
5. `query_pop([italy, 4.775862068965517, philippines, 4.611111111111111])`
6. `query_pop([france, 2.464788732394366, china, 2.440828402366864])`
7. `query_pop([philippines, 4.611111111111111, italy, 4.775862068965517])`
8. `query_pop([ethiopia, 0.777142857142857, mexico, 0.760471204188482])`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the code correctly identifies pairs of countries with population densities differing by no more than 5%.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `density/2` and `query_pop/1` are correctly defined and function as intended. The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`), so no verification of these is required.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density using the formula `Density is Pop / Area`.
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the two countries are distinct (`Country1 \= Country2`) and that their densities differ by no more than 5% (`abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05`).
  - The recursion is not applicable here, as the predicates are non-recursive.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are used, as reported: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the logic to query and compare population densities.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic features.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases such as:
    - Countries with identical names (prevented by `Country1 \= Country2`).
    - Division by zero (implicitly avoided as the `area/2` facts are non-zero).
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present in the test cases.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets the specified requirements. No issues were identified during the evaluation. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic reasoning or DeepProbLog features if the problem scope expands.
