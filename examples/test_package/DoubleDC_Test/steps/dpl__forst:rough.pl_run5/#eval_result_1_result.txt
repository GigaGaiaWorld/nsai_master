  "HASH": "5E40E418",
  "ErrorSummary": "1. Non-list input handling not addressed. 2. Performance issue with insertion_sort/2 for large lists. 3. sort operation fails for stacks with fewer than 3 elements.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for stack operations (e.g., check if Stack is a list). 2. Replace insertion_sort/2 with a more efficient algorithm like quicksort. 3. Modify get_top_n/4 to handle cases where stack length < N by returning all available elements.",
