</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Stack Operations

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Stack Operations Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations in ProbLog, including `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:
- `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`
- `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` = `0.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (probability `0.0000` for all queries).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
The failures indicate that the predicates for the stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are either missing or incorrectly implemented. The provided code only includes a partial implementation for the `sort` operation, which is not tested in the given queries.

**Specific Issues:**
- Missing predicates for `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot`.
- The `sort` operation is implemented but not tested.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- The `sort` operation is logically correct but incomplete (only handles stacks of length ≥ 3).
- The other operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are not implemented, leading to test failures.

**ProbLog Analysis:**
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code.
- The test results show `0.0000` probabilities, indicating that the queries do not match any defined rules.

**DeepProbLog:**
- No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (only `sort` is implemented).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not utilized.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- Non-list inputs are not handled.
- Recursive performance is not tested due to missing implementations.
- Undefined operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are not addressed.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `push` implementation    | `push` operation fails          | Implement `push` predicate.                |
| 2   | Missing `pop` implementation     | `pop` operation fails           | Implement `pop` predicate.                 |
| 3   | Missing `dup` implementation     | `dup` operation fails           | Implement `dup` predicate.                 |
| 4   | Missing `swap` implementation    | `swap` operation fails          | Implement `swap` predicate.                |
| 5   | Missing `over` implementation    | `over` operation fails          | Implement `over` predicate.                |
| 6   | Missing `rot` implementation     | `rot` operation fails           | Implement `rot` predicate.                 |
| 7   | Incomplete `sort` implementation | Untested edge cases (length < 3)| Extend `sort` to handle all stack lengths. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The code requires significant revisions to meet the functional requirements. Implement the missing predicates and ensure comprehensive testing for all stack operations.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
