<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the game rules, the `play/3` predicate for determining game outcomes, and the `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` predicates for calculating the final winner. The test results indicate an error, which requires detailed analysis.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:  
  `query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).`
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 17:21.`

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed.
- **Error Location**:  
  The error occurs in the `play/3` predicate, specifically at the line where the conditional `->` operator is used (line 17:21).
- **Root Cause**:  
  The `->` operator is not correctly interpreted in the ProbLog context, leading to an `UnknownClause` error. ProbLog does not support the Prolog-style `->` operator directly.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `play/3` predicate uses Prolog's `->` operator for conditional branching, which is not natively supported in ProbLog. ProbLog requires explicit probabilistic or logical rules for such conditions.
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented and terminates as expected.
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is tested. The error is purely syntactic.
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The game rules are correctly defined, but the `play/3` predicate fails due to unsupported syntax.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs or undefined moves.
  - The recursive performance is acceptable for small lists but may not scale efficiently for large inputs.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->` operator in ProbLog | Predicate `play/3` fails to execute | Replace `->` with explicit ProbLog rules or use `if-then-else` constructs supported by ProbLog. |
| 2   | No error handling for invalid moves | Undefined behavior for invalid inputs | Add validation for `move/1` predicates before processing. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the `play/3` predicate with ProbLog-compatible syntax:
```prolog
play([], [], []).
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    beats(P1, P2), Result = win, play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    beats(P2, P1), Result = lose, play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    \+ beats(P1, P2), \+ beats(P2, P1), Result = draw, play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The code correctly defines the game rules but fails due to unsupported Prolog syntax in ProbLog. The suggested fix resolves the issue by replacing the `->` operator with explicit ProbLog rules. Edge cases and scalability should be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
