### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is adjusted based on actuator strength and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the probabilistic and classical reasoning.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements.
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for each time step (1 to 5):

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities are consistent with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions increases slightly.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- **`attempted_flap_position/2`**: Correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength and wind effect.
- **`legal_flap_position/1`**: Ensures the flap position remains within bounds (0 to 10).
- **`overrun_exception/1`**: Triggers when the attempted position is illegal.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:
  - Logical correctness is ensured by the recursive termination condition (`Time > 0`).
  - The predicate `goal_reached/1` correctly checks if the flap has reached the target position.
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:
  - The probabilities of `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The system correctly models the flap's movement and goal-checking logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities of actuator usage and wind effects are correctly integrated.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not used in this code.
  - **Non-list Input**: Not applicable.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. No errors or edge cases were identified during evaluation. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the classical logic is correctly implemented.
