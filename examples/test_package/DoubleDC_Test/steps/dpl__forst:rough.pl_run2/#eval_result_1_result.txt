  "ErrorSummary": "Non-list inputs and insufficient stack depth not handled; insertion_sort/2 has performance issues",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for stack operations (e.g., check if Stack is a list). 2. Add stack size checks (e.g., ensure at least N elements for operations like swap/rot). 3. Replace insertion_sort/2 with a more efficient sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort).",
