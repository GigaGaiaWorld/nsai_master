### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a scoring system to determine the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because they have two wins (paper beats rock) and one loss (scissor loses to rock), resulting in a net score of `-1` (player2 wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `play_round/3`: Correctly implements the game rules.  
  - `play/3`: Recursively processes lists of moves.  
  - `compute_score/2`: Accurately calculates the score.  
  - `determine_winner/3`: Correctly determines the winner based on the score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Analysis**:  
  - The predicates are logically correct. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is ensured by the base cases (`[]`).  
  - The game rules (`beats/2`) are exhaustive and cover all possible move combinations.  

- **ProbLog Analysis**:  
  - The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and scoring.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes inputs are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Empty Lists**: Handled correctly by the base cases.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion could be inefficient for very long lists, but this is not a concern for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**: The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. No issues were identified in the tested scenario. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic rules or DeepProbLog features if needed.
