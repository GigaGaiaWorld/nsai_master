### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic rock-paper-scissors game, where two players submit lists of moves, and the winner is determined based on the game's rules. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the logic, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```  
This indicates a failure in the execution of the `determine_winner/3` predicate. No other test results were provided, so this is the only failure to analyze.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
- **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, specifically at the line where the `->/2` operator is used (line 41:77).  
- **Root Cause**: The `->/2` operator is not correctly formatted or supported in the ProbLog context. The predicate `determine_winner/3` is attempting to use Prolog's conditional operator, which may not be directly compatible with ProbLog's syntax.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic for determining the winner (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) is correct in classical Prolog terms. However, the use of the `->/2` operator in ProbLog is problematic.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance**: The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The logic for comparing moves and computing scores is correctly implemented.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable here.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined moves are not handled.  
  - The `->/2` operator is not compatible with ProbLog, leading to runtime errors.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `->/2` operator unsupported      | Predicate fails to execute      | Replace with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2      | No error handling for edge cases | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for moves and list structures. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**  
1. Replace the `->/2` operator with a ProbLog-compatible conditional construct.  
2. Add input validation to handle non-list inputs or undefined moves.  
3. Test with additional edge cases (e.g., empty lists, invalid moves).  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.
