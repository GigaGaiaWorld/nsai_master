<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle `AB + BCD = CDE`, where each letter represents a unique digit (0-9), and the first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be zero. The code uses predicates to define digits, enforce uniqueness, and simulate column-wise addition with carry. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`, all with a probability of `1.0000`. Here are the results:  

| Query                  | Probability |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `[4, 7, 8, 2, 9]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[4, 7, 8, 3, 0]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[5, 6, 7, 2, 8]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[5, 7, 8, 4, 1]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[6, 7, 8, 5, 2]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[7, 4, 5, 2, 6]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[7, 5, 6, 3, 8]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[8, 3, 4, 2, 5]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[8, 4, 5, 3, 7]`      | 1.0000      |
| `[8, 5, 6, 4, 9]`      | 1.0000      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code successfully generates valid solutions for the cryptoaddition puzzle, adhering to the constraints and rules defined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules (`leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`, and `query_sum/1`) are correctly defined and executed as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code enforces the constraints of the puzzle (e.g., unique digits, no leading zeros) and correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different/1` predicate terminates correctly for lists of finite length, as it uses `member/2` and negation (`\+`).  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle using classical Prolog predicates.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid input (a list of 5 variables). Non-list inputs or lists of incorrect length would fail.  
- **Performance:** The `all_different/1` predicate may become inefficient for larger lists due to its recursive nature.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets the requirements for solving the cryptoaddition puzzle. No errors or improvements are necessary for the given problem. However, for scalability, consider optimizing the `all_different/1` predicate for larger inputs.  

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
