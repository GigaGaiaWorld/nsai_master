### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog (Hash: 418D2062)**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided Prolog code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm, which sorts a list using the merge sort technique. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog reasoning.
- Check for edge cases and potential failures.
- Confirm the absence of DeepProbLog features (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly handles the provided test case.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `merge_sort/2`: Correctly splits and merges lists.
  - `split/4`: Accurately divides the list into two halves.
  - `merge/3`: Properly merges two sorted lists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. The recursion terminates as the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are correctly defined.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `length` check (`Len > 1`) ensures termination.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules are used).
- **DeepProbLog Features:** Not used. The code is purely classical Prolog.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic features).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog calls).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the first clause (`merge_sort([], []).`).
- **Single-element List:** Handled correctly by the second clause (`merge_sort([X], [X]).`).
- **Performance:** The recursive depth is logarithmic, but large lists may still pose performance issues due to Prolog's stack limitations.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used | N/A | Not applicable for this task. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is correct for classical Prolog and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. For production use, input validation should be added.
