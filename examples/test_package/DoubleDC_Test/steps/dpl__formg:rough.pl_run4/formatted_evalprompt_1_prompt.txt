</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in Prolog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog (Hash: 418D2062)**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided Prolog code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm, which sorts a list using the merge sort technique. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog reasoning.
- Check for edge cases and potential failures.
- Confirm the absence of DeepProbLog features (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly handles the provided test case.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `merge_sort/2`: Correctly splits and merges lists.
  - `split/4`: Accurately divides the list into two halves.
  - `merge/3`: Properly merges two sorted lists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. The recursion terminates as the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) are correctly defined.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `length` check (`Len > 1`) ensures termination.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules are used).
- **DeepProbLog Features:** Not used. The code is purely classical Prolog.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic features).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog calls).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the first clause (`merge_sort([], []).`).
- **Single-element List:** Handled correctly by the second clause (`merge_sort([X], [X]).`).
- **Performance:** The recursive depth is logarithmic, but large lists may still pose performance issues due to Prolog's stack limitations.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used | N/A | Not applicable for this task. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is correct for classical Prolog and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. For production use, input validation should be added. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
