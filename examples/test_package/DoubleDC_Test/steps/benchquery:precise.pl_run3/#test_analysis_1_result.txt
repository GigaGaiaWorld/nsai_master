### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis for Population Density Query

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Countries with Approximately Equal Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries to find pairs with approximately equal population density. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division and ensures the results meet the specified inequality constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical and probabilistic aspects, and ensure compliance with the requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population density, as defined by the inequality constraints.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the constraints are satisfied for all tested pairs.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Logical Correctness:**  
- The `density/2` predicate calculates the population density using integer arithmetic (`D is (P * 100) // A`), ensuring no floating-point inaccuracies.  
- The `query_pop/1` predicate enforces the constraints `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1`, which approximate the condition `D1/D2 â‰ˆ 1.05`.  

**Probabilistic Compliance:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles all provided country data correctly. However, edge cases such as zero area or population are not addressed, as they are not present in the dataset.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population density.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases and Performance:**  
- The code assumes valid inputs for `pop/2` and `area/2`. Undefined or invalid inputs (e.g., zero area) could lead to division errors.  
- The use of integer arithmetic ensures efficient computation without floating-point overhead.

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is logically correct and meets the specified requirements. No failures were detected in the test results. Future improvements could include handling edge cases like zero area or population to enhance robustness.
