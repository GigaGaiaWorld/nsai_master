### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog: Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game. The code defines the game's rules, calculates results, and determines the winner based on a sequence of moves. The purpose is to verify logical correctness, test results, and adherence to ProbLog conventions.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use expansion predicates like `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc. Thus, no verification is required for these.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The predicates `move/1` and `beats/2` correctly define the game's rules.  
  - The `result/3` predicate accurately determines the outcome of each round (`win`, `lose`, `draw`).  
  - The recursive `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates correctly process lists of moves and calculate the final score.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination when input lists are empty.  
  - The recursive case `play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs])` correctly reduces the problem size.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It operates purely in a deterministic context.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - The code does not use neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game's logic and calculates results.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Invalid inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game scenarios.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic reasoning | Limited to deterministic scenarios | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |
| 2      | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for valid moves and list inputs. |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Consider adding neural network predicates for advanced use cases. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The implementation is logically sound and passes the provided test case. Enhancements could include input validation and probabilistic extensions for broader applicability.
