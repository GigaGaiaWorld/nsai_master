---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities are correct:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any door (`1/3`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is `1/3`.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is `2/3`.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the problem's requirements:
- The host opens a door that is neither selected nor hides the prize.
- The host chooses randomly between two empty doors if applicable.
- The rules for `win_keep` and `win_switch` are correctly defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- Logical correctness is ensured:
  - The `member/2` predicate correctly enumerates doors.
  - Recursion in `member/2` terminates as the list is finite.
- Negations (`\+`) are used correctly to exclude invalid doors.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- Probabilities comply with rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled by `\+ prize(A)`.
  - The host's choice (`open_door`) is fair (50-50 when two doors are available).
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`) are used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `prize/1`, `open_door/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- The code assumes valid inputs (doors 1, 2, or 3). Non-list inputs or invalid door numbers would cause errors.
- Recursion depth is minimal (3 doors), so performance is not an issue.

    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    A < B,
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ prize(B),
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ select_door(B).
