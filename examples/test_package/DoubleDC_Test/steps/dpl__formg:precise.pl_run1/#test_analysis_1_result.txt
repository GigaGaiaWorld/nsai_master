### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with the specified requirements.
- Analyze edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The code was tested with the following query:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented as per the requirements:
1. **Length and Recursive Boundary:** The `length/2` and boundary checks (`Len > 1`) are correctly placed.
2. **Splitting and Merging:** The `split_list/3` and `merge/3` predicates function as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation adheres to the merge sort algorithm:
  - The list is split into two halves (`Left` and `Right`).
  - Recursive sorting is applied to each half.
  - The sorted halves are merged.
- **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) ensure termination.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- The test case is deterministic, so probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation. No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The merge sort logic is correctly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this deterministic test case.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may cause stack overflow, but this is a general Prolog limitation.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Stack overflow | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The merge sort implementation in ProbLog is correct for the provided test case and meets the specified requirements. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features were used in this example.
