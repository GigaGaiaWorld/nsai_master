</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubblesort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors. The evaluation focuses on classical Prolog reasoning, as the code does not utilize probabilistic features or DeepProbLog.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` was executed, but the evaluation resulted in an error:  

```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 13:23.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at the line:  
```prolog
(SwapFlag == true ->
    bubblesort(NewL, Acc, Sorted)
;
    append(Acc, NewL, Sorted)
).
```
- **Line Number:** 13  
- **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is not recognized in ProbLog, leading to an `UnknownClause` error.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The logical correctness of the bubblesort algorithm is sound, but the implementation fails due to the use of Prolog's `->/2` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog.  
  - Recursive termination is correctly handled in the base cases (`bubble([], [], [])` and `bubble([X], [], [X])`).  

- **ProbLog Context:**  
  - The code does not utilize probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The algorithm logic is correct, but the implementation fails due to unsupported syntax.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `forth_sort(3, X)` would fail).  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be problematic for large lists.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unsupported `->/2` operator      | Code execution fails            | Replace with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if/3`). |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation.               |
| 3   | Deep recursion not tested        | Possible stack overflow         | Test with large lists and optimize. |

---

**Word Count:** 450  

**Conclusion:**  
The bubblesort implementation is logically correct but fails due to ProbLog's unsupported syntax. Addressing the `->/2` operator issue and edge cases would resolve the errors. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
