### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.8743 |
| `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0900 |
| `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0100 |
| `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.8559 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.1324 |
| `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0117 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilistic outcomes based on the defined rules and facts.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. The following predicates were verified:  
- `carrying/2`: Correctly models the success and failure of picking up the key.  
- `drops/2`: Accurately represents the conditions for dropping the key.  
- `at/3`: Properly defines the robot's movement and key location.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) terminate correctly and do not lead to infinite loops.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as the initial state (`T=0`) and ensures all actions are grounded in defined facts.  

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for actions like `pickup_succeeds/1` and `goto_succeeds/1` are correctly computed.  
- **Negations:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`. For example, `\+ drops(key,T)` is correctly evaluated.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are accurately computed and propagated.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code does not handle undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`), but none are required in this scenario.  
- Non-list inputs are not an issue, as all inputs are atomic or structured terms.  
- Deep recursion is managed well, with no performance issues detected.
