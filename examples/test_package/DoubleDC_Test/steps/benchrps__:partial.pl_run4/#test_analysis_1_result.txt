### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code: Test Results, Failure Localization, and Root Cause Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules. The evaluation also checks for edge cases and potential improvements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000, as `paper` beats `rock` twice and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a net score of -1 for `player1`.

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates and rules function as intended. Below is a verification of key predicates:  
- **`move/1`**: Correctly defines the three gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
- **`beats/2`**: Accurately models the win-lose relationships.  
- **`result/3`**: Properly handles `draw`, `win`, and `lose` scenarios.  
- **`play/3` and `compute_score/2`**: Recursively compute results and scores without errors.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The code adheres to logical correctness. Recursive predicates (`play/3`, `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly for empty lists.  
  - No undefined predicates or infinite loops are present.  

- **ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It operates purely in a deterministic context.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no `nn/3`, `tensor/…` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes valid input lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for typical game lengths but may degrade for very long lists.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates detected.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The code is functionally correct and adheres to classical Prolog rules. No errors or improvements are required for the given test case.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

**Final Note**: This evaluation confirms the correctness of the provided ProbLog code for the rock-paper-scissors game. Further testing with additional edge cases (e.g., empty lists, invalid moves) is recommended for robustness.
