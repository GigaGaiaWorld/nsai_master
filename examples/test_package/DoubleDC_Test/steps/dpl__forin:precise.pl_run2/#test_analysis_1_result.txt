### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation against the given test case.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test case provided is:
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The code correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm as per the requirements:
  1. Recursively sorts the tail list.
  2. Inserts the head element `H` into the sorted list.
- **Expansion Predicates:** No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this code, so no verification is required for them.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`[]`).
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly as the base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) is properly defined.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code. The probability `1.0000` indicates deterministic behavior.
- **DeepProbLog Features:** No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements insertion sort.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case.
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow (not tested here).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Potential stack overflow | Optimize or use tail recursion. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The insertion sort implementation is correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and performance for large lists should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
