### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads after all tosses. The code uses recursion to achieve this. However, the test results indicate an error related to non-ground probabilistic clauses. This report evaluates the code's correctness, identifies failures, and provides suggestions for improvement.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(_)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = self.handle_nonground(
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
  problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```  
- **Conclusion:** The test failed due to a non-ground probabilistic clause.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(_)`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate/Rule:** `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`  
  - **Line Number:** 1:5 (the line where `make_coin(C,PH)` is defined).  
- **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground because `C` is not instantiated when the fact is used. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be ground (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct and terminates when `CNT` reaches 0.  
  - However, the issue arises from the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,PH)`, which violates ProbLog's requirement for groundness.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The error occurs because `make_coin(C,PH)` is not ground. ProbLog does not allow non-ground probabilistic clauses.  
  - The computation of probabilistic facts (`P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, etc.) is irrelevant here because the code fails before reaching that stage.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the probabilistic fact is problematic).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic clause.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle edge cases like `CNT = 0` explicitly (though the base case exists).  
  - Non-ground probabilistic facts are a critical oversight.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | Code fails to execute          | Instantiate `C` in `make_coin(C,PH)` (e.g., `make_coin(c1,0.8)`).          |
| 2      | Undefined edge case for `CNT = 0` | Potential logical inconsistency | Explicitly handle `CNT = 0` in `coins_r/3` to ensure clarity.              |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code's primary issue is the non-ground probabilistic clause, which must be fixed for the program to run. Once corrected, the recursive logic should work as intended. Edge cases and probabilistic grounding must be carefully addressed to ensure robustness.
