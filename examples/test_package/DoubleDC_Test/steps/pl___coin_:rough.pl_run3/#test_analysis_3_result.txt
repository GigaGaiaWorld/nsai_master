### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates tossing a biased coin (`coin(c1)` with a probability of 0.8 for heads) a specified number of times (`CNT = 4`) and accumulates the total number of heads (`S`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, recursive logic, and adherence to the functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(S)`  
  - **Result:** `total(4) = 0.8000`  
  - **Verification:** The result indicates that the probability of all 4 tosses being heads is 0.8, which is incorrect. The expected probability should be `0.8^4 = 0.4096` for `total(4)`.  
  - **Conclusion:** The test fails.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(4)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `total(4) = 0.4096`  
  - **Actual Result:** `total(4) = 0.8000`  
  - **Error Location:**  
    - The error lies in the recursive predicate `coins_r/3`. The current implementation does not correctly accumulate the joint probability of independent coin tosses.  
    - **Code Block:**  
      ```prolog
      coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
          CNT > 0,
          (coin(c1), NewSC is SC + 1 ; \+ coin(c1), NewSC is SC),
          NewCNT is CNT - 1,
          coins_r(NewSC,S,NewCNT).
      ```  
    - **Issue:** The predicate does not account for the probabilistic independence of each coin toss.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**  
  - The recursive logic is syntactically correct but fails to model the probabilistic independence of events.  
  - The termination condition (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**  
  - The current implementation treats the probability of `total(4)` as the probability of a single toss (0.8), ignoring the joint probability of 4 independent tosses.  
  - The negation (`\+ coin(c1)`) is correctly handled, but the accumulation of probabilities is flawed.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but probabilistic accumulation is flawed).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (incorrect joint probability calculation).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle edge cases like `CNT = 0` or invalid inputs (e.g., negative `CNT`).  
  - Performance for deep recursion (large `CNT`) is untested.

|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 2   | Missing edge case handling       | Potential runtime errors        | Add checks for `CNT = 0` and invalid inputs.                               |
| 3   | DeepProbLog not utilized         | Limited functionality           | Consider integrating neural networks if probabilistic reasoning is complex. |

**Final Note:** The code requires revision to correctly model probabilistic independence and handle edge cases. The current implementation does not meet the functional requirements for probabilistic reasoning.
