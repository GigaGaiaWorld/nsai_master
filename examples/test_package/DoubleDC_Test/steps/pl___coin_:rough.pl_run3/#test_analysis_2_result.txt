### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Error Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code Error: UnknownClause in `coins_r/3` Predicate**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing coins and counting the number of heads (`SC`) after `CNT` tosses. The code includes a recursive predicate `coins_r/3` and a probabilistic fact `coin/1`. However, the test results indicate an `UnknownClause` error, suggesting an undefined predicate or syntax issue. This report analyzes the error, its root cause, and potential fixes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 9:15.
  ```
- **Failed Queries:**  
  - `query(total(_))` failed due to the `UnknownClause` error.  
  - No other queries were executed due to the early termination.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 9, Column 15 in the `coins_r/3` predicate.  
  - The error occurs in the conditional statement `(coin(c1) -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC is SC)`.  
- **Root Cause:**  
  - The `->/2` operator (implication) is not recognized or improperly used in the ProbLog context.  
  - ProbLog does not support Prolog's built-in `->/2` operator for conditional branching without explicit definition.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic in `coins_r/3` is sound, but the conditional branching (`->/2`) is not valid in ProbLog.  
  - ProbLog requires deterministic or probabilistic constructs, not Prolog's imperative control flow.  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**  
  - The code does not violate probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`), as the error is syntactic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Usage:**  
  - **Not used.** The code does not integrate neural networks (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but conditional branching fails).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not fully met due to the `UnknownClause` error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `->/2` operator in ProbLog.  
  - Non-termination risk if `CNT` is negative (not handled).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| #  | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1  | `UnknownClause` for `->/2`       | Conditional branching fails.    | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2  | Unhandled negative `CNT`         | Potential non-termination.      | Add a guard clause: `coins_r(_, _, CNT) :- CNT =< 0, !, fail.` |

---

### **Suggested Fix**  
Replace the conditional statement in `coins_r/3` with ProbLog-compatible logic:  
```prolog
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(c1),
    (coin(c1), NewSC is SC + 1 ; \+ coin(c1), NewSC is SC),
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT).
```

---

### **Conclusion**  
The error stems from the unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog. By replacing it with a ProbLog-compatible alternative and addressing edge cases, the code can meet its functional requirements. No DeepProbLog features are required for this task.
