### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code is an implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Identify and analyze any failures in the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a definition for the `member/2` predicate. The error message is:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at the first use of `member/2` in the code (line 4).
- **Issue:** The predicate `member/2` is used to check membership in a list, but it is not defined in the code. Although the code includes a `my_member/2` predicate, it is not used in place of `member/2`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**
  - The logical correctness of the puzzle constraints is sound, but the implementation fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate.
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here since the failure is due to a missing predicate rather than infinite recursion.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not relevant here.
  - The failure is purely syntactic and does not involve probabilistic reasoning.

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The puzzle constraints are correctly specified, but the implementation fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes the input is a list of houses, but there is no validation for non-list inputs.
  - The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and should terminate for valid inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate     | Query fails to execute         | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` or define `member/2`. |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features used     | Limited to classical reasoning | Consider extending with probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace all occurrences of `member/2` with `my_member/2` in the code, or define the `member/2` predicate as follows:
```prolog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|Y]) :- member(X, Y).
```

---

#### **9. Final Remarks**
The implementation is logically sound but fails due to a missing predicate. Once the `member/2` issue is resolved, the code should correctly solve the Zebra Puzzle. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the analysis is limited to classical Prolog reasoning.
