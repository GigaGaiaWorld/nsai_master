### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, predicate definitions, and error handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code failed during execution with the following error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

- **Failed Query**: The query `zebra(Houses)` failed because the predicate `member/2` is undefined in the ProbLog context.
- **Expected Result**: The query should return a valid arrangement of houses satisfying all constraints.
- **Actual Result**: The query failed due to the missing `member/2` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `member/2` (Line 4 in the code block).  
- **Root Cause**: The predicate `member/2` is not defined in the ProbLog program, despite being used extensively in the constraints.  
- **Impact**: The entire puzzle cannot be solved because the core logic relies on `member/2` to check house attributes.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The puzzle constraints are logically sound, but the implementation fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate.  
  - The recursive termination of predicates like `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` is correct, but they cannot be tested without `member/2`.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  
  - The error is purely syntactic and unrelated to probabilistic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature Usage**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (constraints are correct, but execution fails due to missing predicates).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code assumes the input is a list of 5 houses, but this is not validated.  
  - The undefined `member/2` predicate is a critical oversight.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate | Entire puzzle cannot be solved | Define `member/2` or replace with ProbLog-compatible predicates. |
| 2      | No input validation         | Potential runtime errors       | Add checks for list length and structure. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The Zebra Puzzle implementation is logically sound but fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. To resolve this, either define `member/2` in ProbLog or rewrite the constraints using built-in ProbLog predicates. The code does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features, so the focus should be on classical Prolog correctness.
