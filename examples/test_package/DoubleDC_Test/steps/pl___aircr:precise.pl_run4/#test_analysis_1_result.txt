### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is adjusted based on actuator strength and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to position 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure compliance with the specified requirements.
- Identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for each time step (1 to 5):

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for `goal_reached`, which is expected as the system may not reach the goal immediately. The `overrun_exception` probabilities are low, indicating rare illegal flap positions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented:
- **`goal_reached`** and **`overrun_exception`** are computed as expected.
- The **`attempted_flap_position`** rule adheres to the requirements (actuator selection, wind effect, and goal check).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog:** The recursive logic in `attempted_flap_position` terminates correctly (base case: `Time > 0`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** 
  - The probabilities of `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.
  - The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is handled correctly.
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this code (no `nn/3` or `tensor` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met (e.g., goal checking, actuator selection).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (e.g., wind effects, actuator randomness).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used.
  - **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for small time steps.
