### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities align with the expected behavior of the Monty Hall problem:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any door (`prize/1`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is 1/3.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is 2/3.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation correctly models:
1. **Host Behavior:**
   - Rule for opening a door (`open_door/1`) when two doors are empty (probability 0.5 for each).
   - Rule for opening the only empty door (probability 1).
2. **Player Choices:**
   - Initial selection (`select_door(1)`).
   - Winning conditions (`win_keep`, `win_switch`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
- Logical correctness is ensured by:
  - Proper use of `member/2` for door selection.
  - Correct negation (`\+`) to exclude doors with prizes or selected by the player.
- Recursive termination is guaranteed as `member/2` operates on finite lists.

**ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- Probabilities comply with rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`: Used in `\+ prize(A)`.
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`: Not directly applicable here.
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used.

|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Correct use of Prolog predicates and recursion.                             |
| Probabilistic Logic  | Met         | Accurate modeling of probabilities and host behavior.                       |
| Neural Integration   | Not Used    | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable here.
- **Non-list Input:** Handled by `member/2` (assumes list input).
- **Deep Recursion:** Not an issue due to small problem size.
