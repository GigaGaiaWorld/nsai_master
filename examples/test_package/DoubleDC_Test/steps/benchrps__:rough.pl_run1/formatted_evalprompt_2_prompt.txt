</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Test Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],draw) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player1) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all three outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. This indicates a logical error in the implementation.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Failures:** All test cases fail due to incorrect probability distribution.  
- **Expected Behavior:** Only one outcome should have a probability of 1.0, while the others should be 0.0.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The issue lies in the `play/3` predicate, specifically in the disjunction (`;`) used to determine the result of each move. The current implementation does not enforce mutual exclusivity, leading to multiple outcomes being true simultaneously.

**Code Block with Error:**  
```prolog
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    ( beats(P1, P2), Result = win
    ; beats(P2, P1), Result = lose
    ; Result = draw
    ),
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
```

**Issue:**  
The disjunction allows all three conditions to be evaluated independently, resulting in multiple outcomes for the same move.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Context:**  
- The recursive termination is correct (`play([], [], [])`).  
- The logical error arises from the lack of mutual exclusivity in the `play/3` predicate.  

**ProbLog Context:**  
- The probabilistic results violate the rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0.  
- The current implementation does not account for the fact that only one outcome (`win`, `lose`, or `draw`) should be possible for each move.  

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- **Not used** in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the logical error in `play/3` affects correctness.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to incorrect probability distribution.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Non-list inputs are not handled.  
- Deep recursion performance is acceptable for small lists but untested for large inputs.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect probability distribution | Results are invalid             | Modify `play/3` to enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes.                 |
| 2   | Lack of input validation         | May crash on non-list inputs    | Add checks for list inputs in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.              |
| 3   | Deep recursion untested          | Potential performance issues    | Test with large lists or add a recursion limit.                            |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Note:**  
The implementation requires fixes to ensure logical correctness and probabilistic validity. Addressing the mutual exclusivity issue in `play/3` is the highest priority.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
