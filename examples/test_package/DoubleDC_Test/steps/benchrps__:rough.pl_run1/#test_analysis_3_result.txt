### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a scoring mechanism to determine the winner based on a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and logical rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return self.collapse(string, tokens)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1282, in collapse
    raise UnmatchedCharacter(string, expr_stack[-1].start.location)
problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character '(' at 17:5.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed due to a syntax error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs at line 17, column 5, where an unmatched parenthesis `(` is detected.  
- **Affected Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
      ( beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win
      ; (beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose
      ; Result = draw
      ),
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
  ```
  The issue lies in the nested conditional statements, where the parentheses are not properly balanced.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic for determining the game outcome (`win`, `lose`, `draw`) is correct, but the syntax error prevents execution.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicate `play/3` correctly terminates when the input lists are empty.  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  

**DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The logic for determining game outcomes is correctly implemented (when syntax is fixed).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `determine_winner(rock, paper, W)`).  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unmatched parenthesis    | Prevents code execution         | Fix the nested conditional syntax.  |
| 2   | No edge case handling    | May cause runtime errors       | Add input validation for lists.     |

---

### **Suggested Fix**  
Correct the syntax in the `play/3` predicate:  
```prolog
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    ( beats(P1, P2) -> Result = win
    ; beats(P2, P1) -> Result = lose
    ; Result = draw
    ),
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
```

### **Final Notes**  
The code is logically sound but requires minor syntax fixes. Once corrected, it will meet the functional requirements for classical reasoning in the rock-paper-scissors game. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.  

**Word Count:** ~400 words.
