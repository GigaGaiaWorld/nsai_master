### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Test Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],draw) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player1) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all three outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. This indicates a logical error in the implementation.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Failures:** All test cases fail due to incorrect probability distribution.  
- **Expected Behavior:** Only one outcome should have a probability of 1.0, while the others should be 0.0.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The issue lies in the `play/3` predicate, specifically in the disjunction (`;`) used to determine the result of each move. The current implementation does not enforce mutual exclusivity, leading to multiple outcomes being true simultaneously.

**Code Block with Error:**  
```prolog
play([P1 | P1Moves], [P2 | P2Moves], [Result | Results]) :-
    ( beats(P1, P2), Result = win
    ; beats(P2, P1), Result = lose
    ; Result = draw
    ),
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results).
```

**Issue:**  
The disjunction allows all three conditions to be evaluated independently, resulting in multiple outcomes for the same move.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Context:**  
- The recursive termination is correct (`play([], [], [])`).  
- The logical error arises from the lack of mutual exclusivity in the `play/3` predicate.  

**ProbLog Context:**  
- The probabilistic results violate the rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0.  
- The current implementation does not account for the fact that only one outcome (`win`, `lose`, or `draw`) should be possible for each move.  

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- **Not used** in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the logical error in `play/3` affects correctness.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to incorrect probability distribution.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Non-list inputs are not handled.  
- Deep recursion performance is acceptable for small lists but untested for large inputs.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect probability distribution | Results are invalid             | Modify `play/3` to enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes.                 |
| 2   | Lack of input validation         | May crash on non-list inputs    | Add checks for list inputs in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.              |
| 3   | Deep recursion untested          | Potential performance issues    | Test with large lists or add a recursion limit.                            |

**Final Note:**  
The implementation requires fixes to ensure logical correctness and probabilistic validity. Addressing the mutual exclusivity issue in `play/3` is the highest priority.
