### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of facts representing digits (`digit/2`) and a rule for addition (`addition/3`). The purpose is to verify the correctness of the addition logic and ensure that the probabilistic reasoning adheres to the requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning and probabilistic correctness, as well as edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(addition(img_5, img_6, Z))`  
  - **Result**: `addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000`  
  - **Verification**: The result matches the expected output (`5 + 6 = 11`).  

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The addition logic correctly computes the sum of the digits represented by the images.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The `addition/3` rule is logically sound. It correctly retrieves the digits associated with the images and computes their sum.  
- **Recursive Termination**: No recursion is used in the provided code, so termination is not a concern.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The `digit/2` facts are deterministic (probability = 1.0000), so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(Â¬A)`) are violated.  
- **Implications/Expansions**: No probabilistic implications or expansions are used in the code.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Neural Network Calls**: No `nn/3` or `tensor/...` predicates are used.  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The addition logic works as expected.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (all facts are deterministic).  
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: The code does not handle cases where `digit/2` facts are missing for an image.  
- **Non-List Input**: Not applicable here, but the code assumes valid inputs.  
- **Performance**: No recursion or complex operations, so performance is not a concern.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No handling of missing `digit/2` facts | Potential runtime errors | Add validation or default behavior for undefined inputs. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not utilized | Limited functionality | Consider integrating neural networks for probabilistic digit recognition. |

### **Final Remarks**  
The code meets the basic requirements for classical reasoning but lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize DeepProbLog features. Enhancements could include input validation and neural network integration for probabilistic digit recognition.
