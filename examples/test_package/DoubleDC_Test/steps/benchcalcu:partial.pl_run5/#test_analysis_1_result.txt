### Cryptoaddition Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Cryptoaddition Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` must hold true, with each letter representing a unique digit (0-9) and the first digit of each number being non-zero. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each query returns a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the code correctly satisfies the cryptoaddition constraints for the given inputs.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures the first digit of multi-digit numbers is non-zero.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column addition with carry.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures all digits are unique.  

All predicates are correctly defined and function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to the constraints of the cryptoaddition problem. The predicates `sumdigit` and `all_different` are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different` predicate terminates correctly for both empty and non-empty lists.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code handles non-list inputs gracefully by failing the `all_different` check.  
- **Performance:** The recursive `all_different` predicate may face performance issues for very large lists, but this is irrelevant for the given problem (only 5 digits).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are necessary for the given problem.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.
