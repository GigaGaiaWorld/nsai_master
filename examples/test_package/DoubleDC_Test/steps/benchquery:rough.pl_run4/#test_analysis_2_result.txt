### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Querying Population Density**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within a 5% margin). The code includes predicates for population (`pop/2`), area (`area/2`), and density calculation (`density/3`). However, the query predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined, leading to an error during execution.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Test Result**: The test failed with the error:  
  `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7.`  
  This indicates that the required predicate `query_pop/1` is missing or incorrectly defined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query_pop/1`  
  - **Error Location**: Line 59, column 7.  
  - **Root Cause**: The predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined in the code, despite being required by the functional requirements.  
  - **Expected Behavior**: The predicate should query pairs of countries with approximately equal population density (within 5%).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  - The `density/3` predicate is correctly defined to calculate population density.  
  - The missing `query_pop/1` predicate is the primary issue.  
  - No recursive or termination issues are present in the provided code.

- **ProbLog Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the current code.  
  - The error is purely syntactic (missing predicate) and does not involve probabilistic reasoning.

- **DeepProbLog Context**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (missing `query_pop/1`).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `query_pop/1` is the primary edge case.  
  - Non-list input or invalid data handling is not addressed.  
  - Performance is not a concern due to the small dataset.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| **No.** | **Problem**                     | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                                                                 |
|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Missing `query_pop/1` predicate | Query functionality fails entirely. | Define `query_pop/1` to find country pairs with approximately equal density.   |
| 2       | No probabilistic reasoning      | Limited to classical Prolog.        | Extend with probabilistic facts/rules if needed (e.g., uncertain population data). |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
To resolve the error, define the `query_pop/1` predicate as follows:
```prolog
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05.
```

This predicate will:
1. Calculate the density for two distinct countries.
2. Ensure the difference in densities is within 5%.

---

#### **9. Final Remarks**
The code is logically sound for classical Prolog but lacks the required query predicate. Once `query_pop/1` is implemented, the functionality will meet the requirements. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are currently used.
