  "SuggestedFix": "Add the following predicates:\n1. 'density(Country, Density)' to calculate population density.\n2. 'approximately_equal(Density1, Density2)' to check if densities are within 5%.\n3. 'query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2])' to query and return pairs of countries with approximately equal density.",
