Based on the provided origin_code and generated_code, I'll extract and format the code block that corresponds to the <langda> block in the origin_code. The <langda> block requested a query_pop predicate definition, but the generated_code only shows a query call without the actual implementation.

Here's the formatted output:

```problog
{"HASH": "58E6FAB7","Code": ""}
```

Note: The generated_code section only contained a query call (`?- query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]).`) but didn't provide the actual implementation of the query_pop predicate that was requested in the <langda> block. Therefore, the "Code" field is empty.
