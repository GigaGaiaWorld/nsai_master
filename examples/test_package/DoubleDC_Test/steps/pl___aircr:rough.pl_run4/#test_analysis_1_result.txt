### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is adjusted based on actuator strength, wind effects, and a predefined goal. The system is probabilistic, accounting for uncertainties in actuator selection and wind strength. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for the first five time steps:

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.2311      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1370      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0771      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0455      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0115      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0124      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0106      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the likelihood of overrun exceptions remains low but non-zero.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:
- `attempted_flap_position/2`: Correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and the goal.
- `flap_position/2` and `overrun_exception/1`: Properly handle legal and illegal flap positions.
- Probabilistic facts (`wind/1`, `wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`): Comply with probabilistic rules.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic in `attempted_flap_position/2` correctly updates the flap position based on the previous state, actuator, and wind effect.
- **Termination:** The recursion terminates when the goal is reached or the time limit (`at(5)`) is exhausted.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind` and `wind_effect` are correctly defined and sum to 1 for each condition.
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.

##### **DeepProbLog**
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly updates the flap position and detects overrun exceptions.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for actuator selection and wind effects are correctly modeled.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this code.
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, ensuring performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 450 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic model accurately reflects the uncertainties in the system, and the test results confirm its correctness. No issues were identified during the evaluation.
