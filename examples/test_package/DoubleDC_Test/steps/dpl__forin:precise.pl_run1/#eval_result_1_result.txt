{
  "HASH": "DA97FB01",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. The code correctly implements insertion sort and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks input validation for non-list inputs and may face stack overflow for very large lists due to deep recursion.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation to handle non-list inputs (e.g., `insertion_sort(Input, _) :- is_list(Input), !, fail.`). 2. Consider an iterative approach for large lists to avoid stack overflow.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
