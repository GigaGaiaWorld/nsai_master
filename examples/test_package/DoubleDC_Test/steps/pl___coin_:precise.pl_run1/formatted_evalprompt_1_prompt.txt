<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss scenario where a counter `CNT` decrements from a given value to 0. At each step, if the `CNT`-th coin (`coin(CNT)`) turns up heads (with a probability of 0.8), the success count `SC` increments by 1. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 9:16.
```

- **Failed Query**: `total(S)`  
  - **Expected**: The query should return a probability distribution over possible values of `S` (0 to 4) based on the coin tosses.  
  - **Actual**: The query fails due to an undefined `->/2` operator in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate/Rule**:  
  - The error occurs in the `coins_r/3` predicate, specifically at the line where the conditional `->` operator is used (line 9:16).  
  - **Code Block**:  
    ```prolog
    (coin(CNT) -> 
        SC1 is SC + 1,
        coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1)
    ; 
        coins_r(SC, S, CNT1)
    ).
    ```
  - **Issue**: ProbLog does not support the Prolog `->/2` operator directly. Instead, probabilistic implications must be handled using ProbLog's built-in constructs.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive logic is sound in classical Prolog, but the use of `->/2` is not compatible with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT` reaches 0.  

- **Probabilistic Compliance**:  
  - The code attempts to use a deterministic conditional (`->/2`) in a probabilistic context, which violates ProbLog's rules.  
  - **Suggested Fix**: Replace the `->/2` operator with ProbLog's `if/3` or `prob/2` constructs to handle probabilistic implications.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the conditional is incompatible).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to the misuse of `->/2`.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle edge cases such as `CNT` being negative or non-integer.  
  - Performance for deep recursion (large `CNT`) is untested.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` in ProbLog      | Query fails                     | Replace with ProbLog's `if/3` or `prob/2`. |
| 2   | No edge case handling for `CNT`  | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for `CNT`.             |

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires modification to align with ProbLog's probabilistic constructs. Addressing the `->/2` issue and edge cases will ensure correctness and robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
