### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code simulates a coin toss experiment using ProbLog, where a counter `CNT` decrements from 4 to 0. At each step, if the `CNT`-th coin lands heads (with a probability of 0.8), the success count `SC` increments by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify errors, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an unknown clause for `if/3` at line 8. Here are the details:

- **Query:** `total(_)`
- **Expected Result:** A probabilistic distribution of the total number of successful coin tosses (e.g., `P(total(4)) = 0.4096`, `P(total(3)) = 0.4096`, etc.).
- **Actual Result:** Error: `No clauses found for 'if/3' at 8:5`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `total(_)`
- **Error Location:** Line 8, where the `if/3` predicate is used.
- **Code Block:**
  ```prolog
  if(coin(CNT), 
     (SC1 is SC + 1, coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1)), 
     coins_r(SC, S, CNT1)).
  ```
- **Issue:** The `if/3` predicate is not a built-in ProbLog or Prolog predicate, leading to the error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic is sound, but the use of `if/3` is incorrect. ProbLog does not support `if/3` as a built-in predicate.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code correctly defines `coin(C)` with a probability of 0.8, but the failure to handle conditional branching (`if/3`) disrupts the probabilistic reasoning.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

**Suggested Fix:** Replace `if/3` with ProbLog's conditional syntax or use `probabilistic_if/3` if available. Alternatively, restructure the logic using `->/2` (Prolog's conditional) or explicit probabilistic rules.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but conditional branching fails).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not fully met due to the `if/3` error.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined `if/3` predicate.
  - Non-integer or negative `CNT` values could cause issues (not handled).
  - Deep recursion performance is acceptable for small `CNT` (e.g., 4).

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Unknown `if/3` predicate    | Prevents execution of the query | Replace with `->/2` or ProbLog-compatible conditional logic. |
| 2   | No edge case handling       | Potential runtime errors        | Add guards for `CNT` (e.g., `CNT >= 0`).   |

---

#### **8. Final Remarks**
The code's core logic is sound, but the use of an unsupported predicate (`if/3`) causes the failure. Addressing this issue and adding edge case handling will ensure robustness. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly set up but requires a valid conditional mechanism to function as intended.
