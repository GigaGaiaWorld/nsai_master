### **Aircraft Flap Controller Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Aircraft Flap Controller Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap position is adjusted based on actuator strength and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical constraints, and adherence to the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached` and `overrun_exception` for each time step from 1 to 5:

- **`goal_reached` Probabilities**:
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **`overrun_exception` Probabilities**:
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the likelihood of overrun exceptions remains low.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:
- `legal_flap_position/1` (line 2).
- `actuator_strength/2` (lines 4-5).
- `use_actuator/2` (line 7).
- `wind_effect/2` (lines 10-11).
- `flap_position/2` (lines 14-16).
- `overrun_exception/1` (lines 18-20).
- `goal_reached/1` (lines 22-24).
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (lines 27-33).

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The code correctly implements the logic for calculating the flap position, considering actuator strength, wind effects, and goal conditions.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates as the time steps are bounded by `at(5)`.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The probabilities for `use_actuator`, `wind`, and `wind_effect` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
- **Negations/Implications**: The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled.

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification**: No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the logical constraints for flap movement.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Fully met. The probabilistic facts and their interactions are correctly modeled.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable in this context.
- **Non-list Input**: The input is well-defined (e.g., integers for positions).
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, ensuring performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The code is well-structured, adheres to the requirements, and passes all tests. No issues were identified.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.
