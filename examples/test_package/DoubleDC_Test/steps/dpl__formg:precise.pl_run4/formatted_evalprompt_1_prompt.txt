<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the merge sort algorithm. The code is tested for classical Prolog functionality, recursive termination, and adherence to the specified requirements. The evaluation also verifies the absence of DeepProbLog features and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:**  
  The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:
  1. **Length Calculation and Boundary Check:**  
     The `length(List, Len)` and `Len > 1` conditions ensure recursive splitting only occurs for lists longer than 1.
  2. **Recursive Sorting:**  
     The `merge_sort` predicate correctly splits the list into `Left` and `Right` and recursively sorts them.
  3. **Merging:**  
     The `merge` predicate combines the sorted sublists into the final result.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:**  
    The predicates `split_list`, `merge`, and `append` are correctly defined and ensure the list is split, sorted, and merged as expected.
  - **Recursive Termination:**  
    The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination for empty and single-element lists.
  
- **ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.
  - **DeepProbLog Features:**  
    The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
    **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog predicates.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the list length, but no performance issues are evident for typical inputs.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`split_list`, `merge`, `append`) are correctly defined.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used     | Limited to classical reasoning  | Consider extending for probabilistic use cases. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The merge sort implementation is correct for classical Prolog scenarios and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. Future improvements could include input validation and integration of probabilistic reasoning.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
