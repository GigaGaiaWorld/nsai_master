### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, ...]`). The code uses predicates like `detect_number`, `detect_operator`, and `parse` to interpret the symbols and compute the result. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, including classical reasoning, probabilistic rules, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The expected result for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` is `-13.6667`.
  - The actual result (`0.0000`) does not match the expected value.
  - **Conclusion:** The test fails.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect result.
- **Problematic Predicate:** The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It lacks rules for subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Code Line:** The issue lies in the missing definitions for `parse/2` for operations other than addition (`+`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario:**
  - The `parse/2` predicate is not fully defined for all arithmetic operations. Only the addition case is handled (`[N1, + | T]`).
  - Recursive termination is correct for the addition case but fails for other operations due to missing rules.
- **Probabilistic Scenario:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code correctly parses addition but fails for other operations.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be problematic for very long lists.
  - Division by zero is not checked.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `parse/2` rules for `-`, `*`, `/` | Incorrect results for non-addition operations | Add rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division. |
| 2      | No handling of division by zero  | Potential runtime error         | Add a check for division by zero.          |
| 3      | Non-list input not handled       | Potential runtime error         | Add input validation for lists.            |

---

### **Final Conclusion**
The code fails to meet the requirements due to incomplete implementation of the `parse/2` predicate for all arithmetic operations. The test case for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` returns an incorrect result (`0.0000` instead of `-13.6667`). To fix this, the missing rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division must be added. Additionally, edge cases like division by zero and non-list inputs should be addressed. No DeepProbLog features are used in this code.
