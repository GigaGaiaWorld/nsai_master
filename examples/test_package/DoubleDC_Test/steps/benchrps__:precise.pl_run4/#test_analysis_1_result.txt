### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query provided is:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```  
**Result:**  
The test fails with the error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```  
This indicates a syntax or predicate definition issue in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`  
- **Error Location:** The error occurs at line 41, column 77, where the predicate `determine_winner/3` is being called.  
- **Root Cause:** The predicate `determine_winner/3` is not correctly defined or is missing a clause. The error suggests that the system cannot find a matching clause for the predicate.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are correctly defined and handle the game logic.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate is also correctly implemented for `win`, `lose`, and `draw` cases.  
  - The issue lies in the `determine_winner/3` predicate, which is either syntactically incorrect or missing a definition.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** The code does not integrate neural networks or tensor operations.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The core logic for determining round results and computing scores is correctly implemented.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs or empty lists are not explicitly handled in `determine_winner/3`.  
  - The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly implemented.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing/incorrect `determine_winner/3` definition | Test query fails | Correct the predicate definition or ensure it is properly called.           |
| 2      | No handling of non-list inputs   | Potential runtime errors       | Add input validation for `determine_winner/3`.                              |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code is logically sound for the rock-paper-scissors game but fails due to a missing or incorrect definition of `determine_winner/3`. Once this is fixed, the implementation should work as expected. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the analysis is limited to classical Prolog.
