  "ErrorSummary": "The `determine_winner/3` predicate incorrectly allows both 'Player 2' and 'Draw' to be true simultaneously for the same input due to non-mutually exclusive conditions.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify the predicate to ensure mutually exclusive conditions for `Winner`. Replace the disjunction (`;`) with a clear if-else structure:\n\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n    compute_score(Results, Score),\n    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';\n     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';\n     Winner = 'Draw').",
