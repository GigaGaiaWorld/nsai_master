### Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, aiming to sort a list of integers. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, analyzing its logical structure, and ensuring compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards. The test case involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]) = 1.0000`  
  - **Expected Result:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12])`  

**Conclusion:** The test fails because the output `[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]` does not match the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Actual Output:** `[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]`  
  - **Expected Output:** `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`  

**Error Location:**  
The error lies in the `merge/3` predicate (lines 10â€“17). The merging logic incorrectly places `12` before `2` and `3`, indicating a flaw in the comparison and merging of sublists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
  - The `merge/3` predicate fails to correctly compare and merge the sublists. The issue arises from the `@=<` and `@>` operators, which compare terms lexicographically rather than numerically. This causes incorrect ordering of integers.  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion is correctly implemented and terminates as expected.  

- **ProbLog Analysis:**  
  - The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior. However, the output is incorrect, suggesting a logical error rather than a probabilistic one.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The algorithm sorts the list but incorrectly due to term comparison issues.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable for typical lists but could be problematic for very large lists.  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect merging of sublists    | Output list is not sorted       | Replace `@=<` and `@>` with `=<` and `>` for numeric comparison. |
| 2   | Non-list input not handled       | Program may crash               | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists   | Potential stack overflow        | Optimize recursion or use tail recursion. |

**Final Note:** The merge sort implementation requires fixes in the merging logic to ensure correct numeric sorting. Edge cases and input validation should also be addressed for robustness.
