</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Bubble Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The goal is to recursively sort a list by swapping adjacent elements and verifying the correctness of the implementation through test queries. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.
- **Result:** The test failed with the error: `No clauses found for 'swap/3' at 2:2`.
- **Conclusion:** The test failed due to an undefined predicate `swap/3`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X))`.
- **Error Location:** The predicate `swap/3` is called in the `hole/4` rule (lines 1–4) but is not defined anywhere in the code.
- **Impact:** The entire sorting algorithm fails because the core swapping logic is missing.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm relies on `swap/3` to determine whether to swap adjacent elements. Since `swap/3` is undefined, the program cannot proceed.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/3` is correctly structured, but the missing `swap/3` prevents execution.
- **Probabilistic Context:** No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The sorting logic is structured correctly, but the missing `swap/3` predicate prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined `swap/3` is a critical oversight.
  - Non-list inputs or empty lists are not explicitly handled, which could lead to errors.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `swap/3` predicate | Entire sorting logic fails      | Define `swap/3` to handle swapping. |
| 2   | No edge case handling       | May fail for non-list inputs    | Add input validation.               |

---

### **Code Corrections**
To fix the issue, define the `swap/3` predicate. For example:
```prolog
swap(X, Y, swap) :- X > Y.
swap(X, Y, no_swap) :- X =< Y.
```

### **Final Notes**
The implementation is logically sound but incomplete due to the missing `swap/3` predicate. Once defined, the algorithm should work as expected. Edge cases and input validation should also be addressed for robustness.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
