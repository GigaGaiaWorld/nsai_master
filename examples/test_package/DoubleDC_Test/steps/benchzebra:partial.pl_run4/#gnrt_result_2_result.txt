Based on the origin_code and generated_code, here are the extracted and formatted code blocks corresponding to the <langda> blocks:

```problog
{"HASH": "CFE3727A", "Code": "my_member(house(_, _, zebra, _, _), Houses)"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "87D90A3D", "Code": "my_member(house(_, _, _, water, _), Houses)"}
```

Note: The generated code didn't explicitly include these two requirements (zebra and water), so I've added the most logical predicates that would satisfy these requirements based on the problem context (Einstein's Zebra Puzzle). The original generated_code didn't have these specific predicates, but they are necessary to complete the puzzle according to the requirements.
