<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for the Zebra Puzzle**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code is an implementation of the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze the test results and identify any failures.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure during evaluation. The error message is:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return self.collapse(string, tokens)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1282, in collapse
    raise UnmatchedCharacter(string, expr_stack[-1].start.location)
problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character '(' at 4:10.
```

This error suggests a syntax issue in the code, specifically an unmatched parenthesis at line 4, column 10.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The entire `zebra/1` predicate fails due to a syntax error.
- **Specific Issue**: The error occurs at line 4, where there is an unmatched parenthesis in the `my_member` predicate call:
  ```prolog
  my_member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses
  ```
  The closing parenthesis is missing after `Houses`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenario**:
  - The logical structure of the puzzle is sound, but the syntax error prevents the code from being parsed.
  - Recursive predicates like `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` are correctly defined and should terminate properly.
- **ProbLog Scenario**:
  - The error occurs before any probabilistic reasoning can be applied, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) cannot be verified.
- **DeepProbLog**:
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The logical structure is correct, but the syntax error prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable due to the syntax error.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The syntax error is a critical oversight that halts execution.
  - Input validation (e.g., non-list input) cannot be tested due to the error.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Unmatched parenthesis in `my_member` | Code fails to parse             | Add missing parenthesis after `Houses` |
| 2      | Syntax error halts execution     | No test results can be obtained | Fix syntax and re-run tests         |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The code contains a critical syntax error that prevents it from being parsed and executed. Once the unmatched parenthesis is fixed, the logical structure of the puzzle appears sound, and further testing can be conducted to verify classical and probabilistic reasoning. No DeepProbLog features are used in the current implementation.

**Word Count**: 350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
