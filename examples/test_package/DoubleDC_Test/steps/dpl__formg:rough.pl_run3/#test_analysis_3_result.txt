### Merge Sort in Prolog: Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in Prolog, which recursively splits a list into halves, sorts them, and merges the results. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability is correctly reported as `1.0000`, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly handles the provided test case.  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `merge_sort/2`: Correctly splits, sorts, and merges lists.  
  - `split/3`: Accurately divides the list into two halves.  
  - `merge/3`: Properly merges two sorted lists into one.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined.  
  - The recursive cases (`merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3`) terminate and produce the expected results.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the `split/3` predicate ensures the list is divided into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
    - **"DeepProbLog feature not used."** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in Prolog.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic features used).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists, though this is inherent to Prolog's execution model.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used or required.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors             | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large N | Optimize tail recursion if possible. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
