### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is influenced by actuator strength, wind effects, and probabilistic choices. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure the logical flow adheres to the requirements.
- Analyze edge cases and potential failures.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:

| Query                  | Probability Result |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`      | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`      | 0.2311             |
| `goal_reached(3)`      | 0.1370             |
| `goal_reached(4)`      | 0.0771             |
| `goal_reached(5)`      | 0.0455             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0115             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0124             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0106             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but possible.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, including:
- `attempted_flap_position/2`: Correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and the goal.
- `legal_flap_position/1`: Ensures the flap position remains within bounds.
- `overrun_exception/1`: Triggers when the flap position is illegal.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios:**
  - The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition in `flap_position/2` and `attempted_flap_position/2`.
  - Logical correctness is verified by the alignment of the results with the problem's requirements.

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The probabilities of `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - The fusion of probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind/1`) and deterministic rules (e.g., `actuator_strength/2`) is correct.

- **DeepProbLog:** The feature is not used in this code (`nn/3`, `tensor/…` are absent).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic correctly models the flap movement and goal achievement.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and integrated.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable here.
  - **Non-list Input:** Not relevant in this context.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the edge cases are handled appropriately. No improvements are necessary for the given problem.
