### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion:**  
  The test passed with the expected output. The sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` was correctly generated with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules function as intended:
- **Predicate `swap/3`:** Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on their values.
- **Predicate `bubble/3`:** Recursively processes the list to bubble the largest element to the end.
- **Predicate `bubblesort/3`:** Recursively sorts the list by accumulating the largest elements in the sorted part `[X | L3]`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The predicates `swap/3`, `bubble/3`, and `bubblesort/3` are logically sound. The recursive termination condition in `bubblesort/3` ensures the algorithm terminates when the input list is empty.
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates correctly as the base case `bubblesort([], L, L)` is reached when the list is fully processed.

##### **ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules. The result is deterministic (probability 1.0000), indicating no probabilistic reasoning is involved in this implementation.
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  **DeepProbLog feature not used.** No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements bubble sort in classical Prolog.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Performance:** The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(nÂ²), typical for bubble sort. Deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists.
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog logic. However, it lacks probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be handled for robustness. The recursive design is sound but may not scale efficiently for large datasets.
