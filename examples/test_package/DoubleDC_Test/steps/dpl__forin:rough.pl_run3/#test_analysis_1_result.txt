### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements an insertion sort algorithm (`insertion_sort/2`) and includes a test query to verify its correctness. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.  
- Ensure compliance with classical Prolog and ProbLog requirements.  
- Identify potential edge cases or failures.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test was executed:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed with the expected output.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test. The following predicates were verified:  
- `insertion_sort/2` (lines 1–3): Correctly implements the recursive insertion sort.  
- `insert/3` (lines 4–7): Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`[]`).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, ensuring termination.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The test result (`1.0000`) indicates deterministic behavior, as no probabilistic facts or rules are used.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Status       | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met          | The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.                              |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                  |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used    | No `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls are present.                               |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly (`insertion_sort([], []).`).  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very long lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime error    | Add input validation.                      |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow risk        | Optimize for tail recursion or use iteration. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is correct for classical Prolog but lacks robustness for edge cases. No ProbLog or DeepProbLog features are utilized. Recommendations include input validation and performance optimization.
