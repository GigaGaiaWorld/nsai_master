### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins (beats(paper, rock)).
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins again.
    - `rock` vs `scissor`: Player 1 wins (beats(rock, scissor)).
  - The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates and rules function as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical Prolog:**
  - The rules for `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `result/3` are logically correct.
  - Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly:
    - Base cases (`play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`) are properly defined.
    - Recursive cases advance correctly without infinite loops.
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`). Thus, no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes lists as input for `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Undefined Moves:** If an undefined move (e.g., `spock`) is provided, the predicates will fail.
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists could impact performance, but this is unlikely in a game context.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input for `play/3` or `compute_score/2` | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2      | Undefined moves (e.g., `spock`) | Predicate failure | Extend `move/1` or validate inputs. |
| 3      | Deep recursion for large lists | Performance issue | Optimize or limit input size. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog rules. However, edge cases like invalid inputs or undefined moves should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
