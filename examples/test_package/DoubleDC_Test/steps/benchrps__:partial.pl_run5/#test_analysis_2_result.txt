### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, including rules for determining the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because their moves (paper, paper, scissor) beat Player 1's moves (rock, rock, rock) in two out of three rounds.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Scenarios**:  
  - The logical correctness of the predicates (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3`) is verified.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` by the base case `play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`.  
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not applicable.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The code does not use DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors and computes the winner.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Invalid inputs (e.g., atoms not in `move/1`) may cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.  
  - **Undefined Moves**: The code does not handle moves outside the defined `move/1` facts.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic reasoning  | Limited to classical logic    | Extend with probabilistic facts/rules if needed. |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog integration  | No neural network support     | Use `nn/3` for hybrid reasoning if required. |
| 3      | Undefined move handling     | Potential runtime errors      | Add validation for input moves. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The implementation is correct for classical reasoning but lacks advanced features like probabilistic or neural network integration. Edge cases like invalid inputs should be addressed for robustness.
