  "ErrorSummary": "Parsing error in `sort` predicate due to incomplete implementation and syntax clash. The predicate does not handle stacks with fewer than three elements.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Correct the syntax of the `sort` predicate to avoid parsing errors. 2. Add a base case to handle stacks with fewer than three elements (e.g., `stack_op(sort, Stack, Stack) :- length(Stack, L), L < 3.`). 3. Ensure the `sort` predicate properly sorts and appends the top three elements.",
