#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves the cryptoaddition puzzle `AB + BCD = CDE`, where each letter represents a unique digit (0–9) and the first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be zero. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its logical and probabilistic aspects, and ensure compliance with the requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following queries and their return values (all with a probability of 1.0000):  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9])`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0])`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8])`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1])`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2])`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6])`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8])`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5])`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7])`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9])`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly identifies valid solutions to the puzzle, ensuring that all constraints (e.g., unique digits, no leading zeros, and correct column-wise addition) are satisfied.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules (e.g., `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and function as intended. The main predicate `query_sum/1` adheres to the problem requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The code ensures that all digits are unique (`all_different/1`).  
  - The `sumdigit/5` predicate correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry propagation.  
  - Recursive termination is guaranteed in `all_different/1` and `member/2`.  

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code solves the puzzle using deterministic Prolog rules.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code handles leading zeros (`leftdigit/1`) and ensures digit uniqueness.  
  - No undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are present.  
  - Performance is efficient for this problem size (no deep recursion issues).
