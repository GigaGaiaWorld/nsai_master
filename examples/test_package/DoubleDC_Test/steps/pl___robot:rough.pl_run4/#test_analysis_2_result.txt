### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Navigation and Key Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot navigates between locations and attempts to pick up a key. The key may be slippery, and the robot's actions (e.g., `pickup`, `goto`) have probabilistic outcomes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic logic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4812 |
| `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.6300 |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))` | 0.3000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilistic outcomes based on the defined rules and facts.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. Below is a verification of key predicates:  

- **`carrying/2`:** Correctly models the success and failure of picking up the key.  
- **`drops/2`:** Accounts for the key being slippery or the robot fumbling.  
- **`at/3`:** Accurately represents the robot's and key's positions, including failure cases for navigation.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) terminate correctly due to the base case (`slippery(key,0)`).  
- **Negation as Failure (`\+`):** Used appropriately in predicates like `carrying/2` and `at/3` to handle failure cases.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is satisfied (e.g., `pickup_succeeds(T)` and `pickup_fails(T)` sum to 1).  
  - Implications (`P(A⇒B)`) are not explicitly used, but the rules comply with probabilistic logic.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement | Status | Explanation |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Classical Reasoning | Met | Recursive predicates and negation as failure work correctly. |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Met | Probabilistic facts and rules comply with ProbLog semantics. |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Met | No DeepProbLog features are used. |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given scenario.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | None | N/A | N/A |

**Conclusion:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. No errors or edge cases were identified.
