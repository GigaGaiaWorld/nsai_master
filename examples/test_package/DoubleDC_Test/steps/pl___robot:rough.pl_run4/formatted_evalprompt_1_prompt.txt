<Evaluation_Instructions>

1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Prolog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate an error during evaluation:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = action(s, pos)
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 370, in _token_dot
    raise UnexpectedCharacter(s, pos)
problog.parser.UnexpectedCharacter: Unexpected character '.' at 30:82.
```

- **Queries Executed**:  
  - `query(carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))))`  
  - `query(at(_,_,s(s(s(0)))))`  

- **Results**:  
  - The queries could not be executed due to a syntax error in the code.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**:  
  - The error occurs at line 30, column 82, where an unexpected character `.` is encountered.  
  - The problematic line is likely the one defining the `at/3` predicate for the robot's movement.  

- **Code Block with Error**:  
  ```prolog
  at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-    goto_action(T),    goto_succeeds(T),    do(goto(Pos), T).at(robot,Pos,s(T)) :-    goto_action(T),    goto_fails(T),    at(robot,Pos,T).
  ```
  - The predicates are not separated properly, leading to a syntax error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog**:  
  - The logical structure of the predicates is correct, but the syntax error prevents execution.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base case `at(robot,Pos,0)`.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The probabilistic facts (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`) are correctly defined.  
  - Negation (`\+`) is used appropriately, complying with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present.  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (syntax error prevents full execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly defined but not executed due to syntax error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`) are not present.  
  - Non-list inputs are not an issue here.  
  - Deep recursion is handled correctly.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `at/3` predicate | Prevents execution of queries   | Separate predicates with proper syntax (e.g., newlines or semicolons). |
| 2   | No DeepProbLog features          | Limited to classical ProbLog    | Consider integrating neural networks if needed. |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code has a critical syntax error that must be fixed before further testing. Once corrected, the probabilistic and classical reasoning aspects appear sound. No DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
