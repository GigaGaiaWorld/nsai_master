System: You are a coding assistant. You should use the available tools to complete the task.
Human: You are an expert programmer proficient in Problog and DeepProbLog. Your task is to generate the complete code based on the user's requirements in each <langda> block.
<Code>

0.5::pick(N, a) ; 0.5::pick(N,b).
% a palindrome of length N spans positions 1 to N
palindrome(N) :-
 palindrome(1,N).
% base case for even length: left and right crossed
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A > B.
% base case for uneven length: arbitrary middle character
palindrome(N,N) :-
 pick(N,_).
% recursive case: add same character at both ends and move positions towards the middle
palindrome(A,B) :-
 A < B,
 pick(A,X),
 pick(B,X),
 AA is A+1,
 BB is B-1, 
 palindrome(AA,BB).
bb(N) :-
 
<Langda> Information:
<HASH> Hash tag of code: ECE2B24A </HASH>
<Requirements>The function of the predicate bb(N) is: for a string of length N, it checks whether there is a pair of adjacent positions in which the character b is generated.
 First calculate the maximum starting position Max = N-1;
 Enumerate each position I between 1 and Max;
 For each I, it requires that b is generated at position I (pick(I,b)), and b is also generated at the next position I+1 (pick(I+1,b));
 If any such pair of adjacent positions is found, then bb(N) is true. </Requirements></Langda>
.
len(5).
evidence(palindrome(X)) :- len(X).
query(bb(X)) :- len(X).

</Code>

<Final_Answer> The generated completed code should be formatted as follows:
// other contents
```problog
//the completed original code here

**split**


In section <origin_code> and <generated_code> you will be give two codes,
- in <origin_code> there's incomplete code with <langda> blocks.
- in <generated_code> there's completed code of <origin_code>.
your task is to extract and format each code block in <generated_code> that corresponds to the <langda> blocks in <origin_code>

For each code block, extract it and format it in the following JSON format, please remove all code comments:

```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","Code": "Completed code snippet 1"}
```
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX3456","Code": "Completed code snippet 2"}
```

If there's no corresponding code exist:
```problog
{"HASH": "XXXX7890","Code": ""}
```
