  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It simplifies the conditions in the 'open_door' clauses by explicitly stating the constraints (A \\= B, A \\= S, B \\= S) and removing redundant checks. The logic for 'win_keep' and 'win_switch' remains unchanged, ensuring the same probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors. The generated code is more concise while maintaining the same behavior as the original."
