  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. Both codes implement the Monty Hall problem correctly, with the same probability distributions for prize selection, door selection, and outcomes (win_keep and win_switch). The generated code simplifies some conditions by explicitly stating the constraints, but the logic remains equivalent. The running results of both codes are identical, confirming their consistency."
