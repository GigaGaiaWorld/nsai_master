  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to simplify the original Monty Hall problem implementation but introduces errors. The main issue is in the 'open_door' predicate, which uses undefined predicates 'random_select' and incorrect logic for door selection. This makes the generated code invalid and unable to run. The original code correctly models the problem with proper probability distributions and door-opening rules, producing the expected results (win_keep=0.3333, win_switch=0.6667). The generated code fails to replicate this behavior due to its syntactic and logical errors."
