  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and incorrect compared to the original code. It only includes one constraint (my_member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses) and misses all other constraints present in the original code. The generated code's result shows multiple possible solutions with many unbound variables, indicating it fails to solve the zebra puzzle as intended. The original code provides a complete solution with all variables bound correctly."
