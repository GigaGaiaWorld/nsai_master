  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally identical to the original code, with only minor formatting differences such as line breaks and spacing. The logic and structure of the merge sort algorithm remain unchanged, including the base cases, splitting, merging, and append operations. Both codes produce the same correct output when sorting the list [3,1,2,5,7,12]. There are no functional or logical issues in the generated code."
