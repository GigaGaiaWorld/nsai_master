  "final_report": "The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm but contains several issues. First, it lacks the 'append/3' predicate which causes a runtime error. Second, the bubble sort logic is different from the original code, particularly in how it handles the accumulation of sorted elements. The original code uses a three-argument bubblesort with an accumulator, while the generated code tries to use append which isn't defined. The generated code is not valid due to these issues."
