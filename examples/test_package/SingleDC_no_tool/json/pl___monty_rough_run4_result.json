  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error in the 'open_door' predicate. The predicate is missing a closing parenthesis and has incorrect usage of 'findall' and 'length'. This makes the code unable to run, unlike the original code which executes correctly. The original code produces expected results for the Monty Hall problem, showing probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors. The generated code fails to achieve this due to its invalid syntax."
