  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It simplifies the conditions in the 'open_door' rules by explicitly stating the constraints on the selected door and the prizes, making the logic clearer while maintaining the same probabilistic outcomes. Both codes produce identical results for the Monty Hall problem, demonstrating that the generated code meets the requirements effectively."
