/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it introduces a non-ground probabilistic clause by using 'coin(C)' without properly grounding the variable C. This leads to a runtime error. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic choice by grounding the variable CNT in the recursive call. The generated code fails to maintain the same logic and structure, resulting in invalid syntax and inconsistent behavior.
