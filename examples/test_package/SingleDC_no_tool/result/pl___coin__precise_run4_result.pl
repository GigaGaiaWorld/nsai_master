/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False

Report: The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error. The error occurs at the '(' character, indicating an issue with the conditional statement structure. The original code uses a disjunction (;) for the coin flip outcomes, while the generated code attempts to use an if-then-else structure (->) but fails to properly format it. The generated code does not meet the requirements as it cannot be executed.
