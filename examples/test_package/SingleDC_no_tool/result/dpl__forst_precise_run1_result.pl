/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is mostly correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It correctly implements stack operations like push, pop, dup, swap, over, and rot. However, the 'sort' operation in the generated code is simplified to handle exactly 3 elements (X, Y, Z) and uses a 'sort3' predicate which is not defined in the provided code. This differs from the original code which uses a more general 'insertion_sort' and 'get_top_n' approach. Despite this, the running results for the tested queries are identical to the original code's results, as the 'sort' operation is not tested in the provided queries.
