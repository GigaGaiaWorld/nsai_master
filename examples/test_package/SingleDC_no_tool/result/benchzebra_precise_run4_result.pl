/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code has several issues. First, it uses 'member/2' instead of 'my_member/2', which causes an error since 'member/2' is not defined. Second, the order of attributes in some house predicates is inconsistent with the original code, leading to potential logical errors. The generated code also incorrectly places 'snail' instead of 'snails' and misplaces some attributes like 'dog' and 'fox'. These inconsistencies make the generated code invalid and its results inconsistent with the original code.
