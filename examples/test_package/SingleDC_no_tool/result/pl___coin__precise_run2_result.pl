/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct as it introduces a syntax error by using the '->' operator incorrectly in Problog. The original code uses a disjunction (;) to handle both cases of coin/1 success or failure, while the generated code attempts to use an if-then-else construct incorrectly. This leads to a runtime error ('UnknownClause') because Problog does not recognize the '->' operator in this context. The original code's logic is to count successful coin flips, which the generated code fails to replicate due to its invalid syntax.
