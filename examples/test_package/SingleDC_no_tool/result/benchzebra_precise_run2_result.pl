/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code but has some issues. The order of attributes in the 'house' predicate is different (nationality and color are swapped), which affects readability but not functionality. There's a typo in 'snail' instead of 'snails'. The logic and constraints remain the same, and the solution is correct. The output matches the original in substance, though attribute order differs.
