/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. The original code uses a single recursive clause with a disjunction (;), while the generated code splits this into two separate clauses for clarity. Both versions correctly model the probabilistic coin flipping scenario and produce identical results. The generated code is more readable due to the separation of cases.
