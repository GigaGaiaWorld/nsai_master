/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. It introduces an undefined predicate 'heads' and incorrectly modifies the logic of the original code. The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips, while the generated code attempts to use an undefined conditional statement 'heads -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC is SC', leading to a runtime error. The generated code is neither syntactically valid nor logically consistent with the original code.
