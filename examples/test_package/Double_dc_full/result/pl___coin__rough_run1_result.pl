/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is that it uses a non-ground probabilistic clause 'coin(Outcome)' which causes an error during execution. The original code correctly handles the probabilistic nature of the coin flips by using separate cases for success and failure, while the generated code attempts to use a single variable 'Outcome' which is not properly grounded. This leads to a runtime error, making the generated code invalid.
