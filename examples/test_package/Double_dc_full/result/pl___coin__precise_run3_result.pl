/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the expectations. It significantly differs from the original code in logic. The original code uses a probabilistic approach to count successful coin flips, while the generated code incorrectly modifies the recursion and counting mechanism, leading to incorrect results. The generated code lacks the probabilistic branching and proper accumulation of successful counts, resulting in a single, incorrect output.
