/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error. Specifically, there is an unmatched character '(' at line 8, column 5, which causes the parser to fail. The original code correctly implements a probabilistic coin flipping scenario and produces valid results. The generated code, however, fails to execute because of this syntax issue, making it inconsistent with the original code both in form and result.
