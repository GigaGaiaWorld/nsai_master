/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code has a syntax error where 'member' is used instead of 'my_member', which is the predicate defined in the original code. This inconsistency causes the Problog engine to fail with an 'UnknownClause' error. The rest of the code structure is consistent with the original, but this single error makes the generated code invalid.
