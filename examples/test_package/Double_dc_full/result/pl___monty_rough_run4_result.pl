/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, producing the same results as the original code. Both codes achieve the expected probabilities for winning by keeping or switching doors (1/3 and 2/3 respectively). The generated code simplifies the door-opening logic into a single rule with probabilistic choice, which is more concise but functionally equivalent to the original's separate rules. No functional discrepancies or problems were found.
