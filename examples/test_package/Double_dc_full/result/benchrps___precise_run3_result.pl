% Basic rules of rock-paper-scissors
% -------------------------
% Three gestures
move(rock).
move(paper).
move(scissor).
% Win-lose relationship: X beats Y
beats(rock, scissor).
beats(scissor, paper).
beats(paper, rock).
% -------------------------
% Calculate the result of the game
% -------------------------
% Same gestures are considered a draw
result(X, X, draw) :-
 move(X).
 
% If X beats Y, then X wins
result(X, Y, win) :-
beats(X, Y).
% If Y beats X, then X loses
result(X, Y, lose) :-
beats(Y, X).
 
% End of recursion: empty list corresponds to empty result
play([], [], []).
% Recursive advancement: take out each round of gestures, calculate the results, and continue
play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs]) :-
% The correct call is result(P1,P2,R), not semicolon
result(P1, P2, R),
% (Optional) Update the score according to R
play(P1T, P2T, Rs).

compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.

/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, it introduces a syntax error by using an arrow operator '->' in the determine_winner predicate, which is not valid in standard Prolog syntax. This causes the code to fail during execution. The original code uses a disjunction with semicolons, which is correct. The expected functionality of determining the winner based on the score remains the same in both codes, but the generated code fails to execute due to the syntax error.
