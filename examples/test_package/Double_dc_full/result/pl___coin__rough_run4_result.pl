/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the incorrect use of the '->' operator in the 'coins_r' predicate, which leads to a syntax error in Problog. The original code uses a disjunction (;) to handle the probabilistic choice, while the generated code incorrectly attempts to use a conditional operator. This makes the generated code invalid and unable to run as intended. Additionally, the generated code does not maintain the same probabilistic behavior as the original code, which is designed to count successful coin flips.
