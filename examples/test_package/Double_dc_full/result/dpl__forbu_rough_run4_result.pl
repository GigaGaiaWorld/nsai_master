/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code attempts to implement a bubble sort algorithm but contains several issues. First, it incorrectly defines the 'swap' and 'bubble' predicates, leading to a logical error in the sorting process. The original code uses a 'hole' predicate to manage swaps and accumulates the sorted list differently. The generated code also includes duplicate 'query' and 'forth_sort' clauses, which cause a runtime error due to conflicting definitions. The original code successfully sorts the list, while the generated code fails to execute due to these errors.
