/* Result Report:
Validity_form: False
Validity_result: False
Report: The generated code is not correct and does not meet the requirements. The main issue is the use of '->' operator in the condition, which is not valid in Problog syntax. The original code uses a disjunction with ';' to handle the probabilistic choice, while the generated code incorrectly attempts to use an if-then-else construct. This leads to a syntax error during execution. Additionally, the generated code hardcodes the coin identifier as 'c1' instead of using the variable 'CNT' as in the original, which changes the intended behavior.
