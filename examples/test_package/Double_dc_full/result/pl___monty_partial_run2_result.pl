/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It simplifies some conditions in the 'open_door' rules by explicitly stating the constraints (A \= Selected, B \= Selected, A \= B) instead of using inequalities and negations. This makes the code clearer while maintaining the same logical flow. Both codes produce identical results, confirming the correctness of the generated code.
