/* Result Report:
Validity_form: True
Validity_result: True
Report: The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining the same probabilistic behavior as the original code. It simplifies the door-opening rule by using findall to identify non-prize, non-selected doors and then randomly selecting one with equal probability. This change makes the code more concise while preserving the original functionality. Both codes produce identical results, confirming their equivalence in behavior.
