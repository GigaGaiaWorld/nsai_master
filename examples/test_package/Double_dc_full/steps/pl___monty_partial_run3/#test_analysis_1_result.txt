### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior, winning conditions).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic (as expected).
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the theoretical solution (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules adhere to the problem's requirements:
- **`open_door/1` Rules:**
  - Correctly handles cases where both unselected doors are empty (random selection) or one has a prize (selects the empty door).
- **`win_keep` and `win_switch`:**
  - Accurately model the winning conditions for both strategies.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog:**
- Logical correctness is ensured:
  - Recursive predicates (e.g., `member/2`) terminate correctly.
  - Negations (`\+`) are used appropriately to exclude invalid doors.
  
**Probabilistic Reasoning:**
- Probabilities comply with rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is implicitly handled (e.g., `\+ prize(A)`).
  - The host's behavior (`open_door/1`) correctly reflects the problem's constraints.

**DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `prize/1`, `open_door/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., doors 1–3). Non-list inputs or invalid door numbers would cause errors.
- **Performance:** Recursion depth is minimal, so performance is not a concern.

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |

    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    member(B, [1,2,3]),
    A \= Selected, B \= Selected,
    A \= B, \+ prize(A), \+ prize(B).
```
