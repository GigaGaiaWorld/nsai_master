### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads after all tosses. The code uses recursion and probabilistic facts to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
```

- **Failed Query**: `total(S)`  
  - **Expected Result**: A probabilistic distribution of the total number of heads after 4 coin tosses (e.g., `P(total(0)) = 0.0016`, `P(total(1)) = 0.0256`, etc.).  
  - **Actual Result**: Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator in the recursive rule.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `coins_r/3`  
  - **Code Line**: The recursive rule (lines 5â€“9) contains the error.  
  - **Issue**: The `->/2` operator is not correctly defined or used in the context of ProbLog. The syntax `(coin(CNT) -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC is SC)` is invalid in ProbLog for probabilistic reasoning.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive termination condition (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined.  
  - The recursive step fails because ProbLog does not support the `->/2` operator for probabilistic branching. Instead, probabilistic facts should be used to model the coin toss outcomes.  

- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The code attempts to use a deterministic `if-then-else` construct (`->/2`) in a probabilistic context, which violates ProbLog's semantics.  
  - Correct approach: Use probabilistic facts (`coin(C)`) and aggregate results without conditional branching.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but branching is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (incorrect use of `->/2`).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2`: Not relevant here.  
  - Non-list input: Not applicable.  
  - Deep recursive performance: The recursion depth is fixed (`CNT=4`), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator       | Recursive branching fails       | Replace `->/2` with probabilistic facts or use `probabilistic_if/3` from a library. |
| 2   | Incorrect probabilistic logic   | Results are not probabilistic   | Model coin tosses as independent probabilistic facts and aggregate results. |

#### **8. Corrected Code Suggestion**  
```problog
% Probabilistic fact for a biased coin (0.8 probability of heads)
0.8::coin_heads.
coin(C) :- coin_heads.

% Base case: 0 coins tossed, SC = S.
coins_r(SC, SC, 0).

% Recursive case: Toss a coin and update SC.
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(CNT),
    NewSC is SC + 1,
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NewSC, S, NewCNT).

% Alternative: Handle tails case explicitly.
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    \+ coin(CNT),
    NewCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC, S, NewCNT).

total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).
```
