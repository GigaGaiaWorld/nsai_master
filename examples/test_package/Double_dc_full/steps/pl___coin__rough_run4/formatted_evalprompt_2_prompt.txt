    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`S`). The code uses recursion to sample coins and count heads. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any logical or probabilistic errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:16.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Expected Result:** A probabilistic distribution over the number of heads after 4 coin tosses (e.g., `P(total(0))=0.0016`, `P(total(1))=0.0256`, etc.).  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to an undefined `->/2` operator.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 8, Column 16: The `->/2` operator is used in the recursive rule `coins_r/3` but is not correctly defined or supported in the ProbLog context.  
  - **Affected Predicate:**  
    ```prolog
    (coin(CNT) -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC is SC)
    ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive termination condition (`coins_r(SC,SC,0)`) is correctly defined.  
  - The issue arises from the use of the `->/2` operator, which is not natively supported in ProbLog for probabilistic reasoning.  

- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:**  
  - The code does not violate probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` because the error occurs before such computations.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the `->/2` operator is problematic).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle non-ground inputs or undefined `expand/2` cases.  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be an issue for large `CNT`.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` operator        | Prevents probabilistic evaluation | Replace `->/2` with a ProbLog-compatible conditional (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2   | Non-ground inputs not handled    | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation or grounding checks.                                  |
| 3   | Deep recursion not tested        | Performance issues for large `CNT` | Test with large `CNT` and optimize tail recursion if needed.               |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires modification to replace the unsupported `->/2` operator with a ProbLog-compatible alternative. Once fixed, the probabilistic reasoning should work as intended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
