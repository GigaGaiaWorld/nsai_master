### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Conversion and Multi-Addition**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines predicates for converting a list of images into a corresponding number and performing multi-digit addition. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], Z)).
```
**Result:**  
- `multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], 391) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- The result matches the expected output (`79 + 312 = 391`).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `number/3` and `multi_addition/3` function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `number/3` predicate recursively processes the list of images, converting each image to its corresponding digit and accumulating the result. The base case (`number([], Result, Result)`) ensures termination.  
  - The `multi_addition/3` predicate correctly parses the input lists into numbers and performs the addition.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion in `number/3` terminates when the input list is empty, as specified in the base case.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no probabilistic facts like `0.5::digit(...)`). Thus, no probabilistic rules (e.g., negation or implication) need verification.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:**  
   - The code meets the requirements for converting image lists to numbers and performing addition.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
   - Not applicable in this context.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:**  
   - Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list of valid image atoms (e.g., `[img_1, img_2]`). Non-list inputs or invalid atoms would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, which is manageable for typical use cases.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is functionally correct for the given requirements and test case. No errors or improvements are identified.
