### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the overall winner based on a list of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any logical or syntactical errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code, specifically in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `determine_winner/3`  
  - **Error Location**: Line 41 (approximate, based on the error message).  
  - **Issue**: The predicate definition is incomplete or malformed. The error suggests a missing or incorrect clause for the `->/2` operator.  
  - **Expected Behavior**: The predicate should correctly compute the winner based on the results of `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `result/3` and `play/3` predicates are logically correct for determining the outcome of each round.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score based on the results of each round.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly for empty lists.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`).  
  - No probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated, as the code is purely deterministic.  

- **Error in `determine_winner/3`**:  
  The predicate is incorrectly defined. The `->/2` operator is not properly used, leading to the `UnknownClause` error. The correct implementation should be:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
      compute_score(Results, Score),
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; 
       Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; 
       Winner = 'Draw').
  ```

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met, except for the `determine_winner/3` predicate.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., `determine_winner(rock, paper, W)`).  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Malformed `determine_winner/3`   | Prevents winner determination   | Correct the predicate definition as shown in the Root Cause Analysis.      |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs  | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation or guard clauses.                                     |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code is mostly correct but fails due to a malformed `determine_winner/3` predicate. Fixing this predicate and adding input validation will resolve the issues. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
