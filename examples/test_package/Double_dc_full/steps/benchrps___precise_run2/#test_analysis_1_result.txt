### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, including rules for moves, win/lose/draw outcomes, and score computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any logical or syntactic errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the error:  
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
  ```
  This indicates a syntax or logical error in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)` failed due to an undefined predicate or syntax error.
- **Error Location**:  
  The error points to line 41, column 77, where the `->` operator is incorrectly used or missing a clause. The issue lies in the `determine_winner` predicate definition.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The `determine_winner` predicate is incorrectly defined. The `->` operator is used without proper clauses or conditions.  
  - The recursive termination in `compute_score` and `play` predicates is correct, but the error prevents execution.  
- **Probabilistic Scenario**:  
  No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The core logic for moves and outcomes is correct, but the `determine_winner` predicate is flawed.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs or undefined moves are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue due to the small input size in the test case.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Syntax error in `determine_winner` | Prevents execution of the query | Correct the predicate definition to use proper conditions for `->` operator. |
| 2   | Missing edge case handling       | Undefined behavior for invalid inputs | Add input validation for moves and list structures.                        |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code Snippet**  
Here is the corrected `determine_winner` predicate:  
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
    compute_score(Results, Score),
    (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1';
     Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2';
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The code has a logical structure for the rock-paper-scissors game but fails due to a syntax error in the `determine_winner` predicate. Correcting this and adding edge-case handling will ensure robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
