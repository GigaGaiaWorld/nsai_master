### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to determine the winner of a series of moves between two players. The implementation includes:
- Definitions of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
- Rules for determining the outcome of a single round (`result/3`).
- A recursive predicate (`play/3`) to compute the results of multiple rounds.
- A scoring mechanism (`compute_score/2`) to tally the results.
- A main predicate (`determine_winner/3`) to declare the winner based on the score.

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test query is:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Result:**
The test fails with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```

**Interpretation:**
The error indicates that the ProbLog engine could not find a valid clause for the `->` operator (if-then-else) in the `determine_winner` predicate. This suggests a syntax or logical error in the predicate definition.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically at the line where the `->` operator is used.
- **Code Block with Error:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
- **Issue:** The `->` operator is not correctly formatted or supported in the ProbLog context. ProbLog does not natively support if-then-else constructs in this form.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic for determining the winner is sound, but the implementation of the `determine_winner` predicate is incorrect due to the misuse of the `->` operator.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined and terminate properly.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The logic for determining the winner is correctly implemented except for the `determine_winner` predicate.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - The `determine_winner` predicate fails due to syntax issues.
  - Deep recursion is not a concern here due to the simplicity of the game.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Misuse of `->` operator         | Predicate fails to execute      | Replace the `->` operator with a series of `if-then-else` clauses or use `(Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw')`. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs  | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation to ensure `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists.          |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the `determine_winner` predicate with the following corrected version:
```prolog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game is mostly correct, but the `determine_winner` predicate fails due to a syntax error. The suggested fix resolves the issue. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this code. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
