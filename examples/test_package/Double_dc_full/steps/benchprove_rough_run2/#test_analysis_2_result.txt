### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a meta-interpreter for proving goals and extends it with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:  

| Query | Result (Probability) |
|-------|----------------------|
| `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(expand(double(3),6))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` | 0.0000 |

**Observation**: All queries returned a probability of `0.0000`, indicating failures.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The following predicates are missing or incorrectly implemented:  
1. **`implies/2`**: Defined as `implies(A, B) :- \+ A; B.` but not integrated into the meta-interpreter.  
2. **`opposite/1`**: Not defined in the code.  
3. **`expand/2`**: Defined for `double/1` and `square/1` but not linked to the meta-interpreter.  
4. **`includes/2`**: Not defined in the code.  
5. **`extend/3`**: Not defined in the code.  
6. **`refute/1`**: Not defined in the code.  

**Code Line Numbers**: The missing predicates are not present in the provided code.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog**:  
  - The meta-interpreter (`prove/1`) does not handle the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.).  
  - Recursive termination is correct for `member/2` and `prove/1`, but the extended predicates are not invoked.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:  
  - The results indicate no probabilistic facts or rules are involved in the queries.  
  - The negation (`\+`) in `implies/2` is not evaluated probabilistically (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  

- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used**.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (basic `prove/1` works, but extended predicates are missing).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not tested or demonstrated.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2` for non-numeric inputs.  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` would fail.  
  - Deep recursion performance is untested.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing `opposite/1` | Queries fail | Implement `opposite(A) :- \+ A.` |
| 2   | Missing `includes/2` | Queries fail | Implement `includes(X, [X|_]). includes(X, [_|T]) :- includes(X, T).` |
| 3   | Missing `extend/3` | Queries fail | Implement `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).` |
| 4   | Missing `refute/1` | Queries fail | Implement `refute(Goal) :- \+ prove(Goal).` |
| 5   | `implies/2` not integrated | Queries fail | Add `prove(implies(A, B)) :- prove(\+ A); prove(B).` |
| 6   | No probabilistic facts | No probabilistic results | Add probabilistic facts/rules for testing. |

**Final Note**: The code requires significant revisions to meet the extended logic processing requirements. The meta-interpreter must be updated to handle the new predicates, and probabilistic testing should be included.
