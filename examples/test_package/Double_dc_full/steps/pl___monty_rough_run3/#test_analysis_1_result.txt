### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch their selection. This ProbLog implementation models the problem to verify the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic and correctly set to 1.  
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the expected probabilities (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. The `open_door/1` predicate correctly handles the case where two doors are available for opening (uniformly random).  
2. It also handles the case where only one door is available (deterministic opening).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `member/2` and `open_door/1` are logically sound. Recursion in `member/2` terminates correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The negation `\+ prize(X)` complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  
  - The disjunction in `open_door/1` (`0.5::Door = A ; 0.5::Door = B`) correctly models uniform randomness.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Satisfied (e.g., `member/2` and deterministic rules).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Satisfied (e.g., uniform distribution for `open_door/1`).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this implementation.  
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures valid lists are passed.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue here due to shallow recursion.
