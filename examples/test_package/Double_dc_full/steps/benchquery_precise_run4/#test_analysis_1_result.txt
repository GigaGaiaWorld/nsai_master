### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division, ensuring computational efficiency. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the logic, testing the results, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected output, confirming that the logic for identifying countries with approximately equal population densities is correct.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- `query_pop/1` and `density/2` adhere to the requirements.  
- The inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1` ensure the approximation of `D1/D2 < 1.05`.  
- The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the integer population density using floor division.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The logic is sound, and the recursive termination is ensured by the finite database of countries.  
- The use of integer arithmetic avoids floating-point inaccuracies.  

**Probabilistic ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are applicable.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The query logic correctly identifies pairs of countries with similar population densities.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles all defined countries in the database.  
- Undefined countries or invalid inputs (non-list) are not addressed, but the current implementation assumes valid inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Code Blocks:**  
```prolog
query_pop([C1, D1, C2, D2]) :- 
    density(C1, D1),
    density(C2, D2),
    C1 @< C2,
    20 * D1 < 21 * D2,
    20 * D2 < 21 * D1.
```

```prolog
density(C, D) :-
    pop(C, P),
    area(C, A),
    D is (P * 100) // A.
```

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The code is robust for its intended purpose, with no failures detected. Future enhancements could include handling edge cases like undefined countries or invalid inputs.
