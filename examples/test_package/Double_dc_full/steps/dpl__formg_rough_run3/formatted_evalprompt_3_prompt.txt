 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],X2) = 0.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the merge sort implementation.
- Analyze the test results for classical and probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X2) = 0.0000
```
**Analysis:**
- The result `0.0000` indicates a failure in the query execution. The expected output should be a sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0` (deterministic case).
- **Conclusion:** The test failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Actual vs. Expected:**
- **Actual:** `0.0000` (no output).
- **Expected:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with probability `1.0`.

**Error Location:**
- The issue lies in the `merge/3` predicate (lines 10–17). The predicate does not correctly handle the merging of sorted sublists.
- **Specific Issue:** The `merge/3` rules do not account for all possible cases of merging, leading to incomplete or incorrect results.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenario:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly splits the list into halves and recursively sorts them. However, the `merge/3` predicate fails to merge the sorted sublists correctly.
- **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined, ensuring termination.

**ProbLog Scenario:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so the probabilistic reasoning aspect is not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The sorting logic is correct, but the merging logic fails.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** No issues observed, but the incorrect merging logic overshadows this.
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect merging logic in `merge/3` | Sorting fails for all inputs. | Revise the `merge/3` predicate to correctly handle all merging cases.      |
| 2      | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Probabilistic reasoning not tested. | Add probabilistic facts or rules if required.                              |
| 3      | Non-list input not handled       | Code may crash for invalid inputs. | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` checks).                           |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation requires fixes in the `merge/3` predicate to function correctly. Edge cases and probabilistic features should be addressed if required by the use case.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
