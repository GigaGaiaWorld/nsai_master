</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog (Hash: 418D2062)**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the functional requirements of interpretability and classical reasoning.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed with the correct output and a probability of 1.0000.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation correctly sorts the input list and adheres to the expected behavior.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly implements the divide-and-conquer strategy of merge sort.  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination.  
  - The recursive calls (`merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft)` and `merge_sort(Right, SortedRight)`) are correctly structured.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the `split/4` predicate ensures the list is divided into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** The code does not involve neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement           | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning   | Satisfied   | The implementation correctly performs merge sort in a deterministic context. |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used  | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists may cause stack overflow, but this is a general limitation of Prolog's recursion.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** The `append/3` predicate is correctly defined, but its inclusion in the code block is redundant as it is a built-in predicate in most Prolog systems.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2   | Redundant `append/3`     | None (built-in predicate)       | Remove redundant definition.               |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The merge sort implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. No DeepProbLog features are employed.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
