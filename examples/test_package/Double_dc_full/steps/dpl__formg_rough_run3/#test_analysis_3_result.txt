### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the merge sort implementation.
- Analyze the test results for classical and probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X2) = 0.0000
```
**Analysis:**
- The result `0.0000` indicates a failure in the query execution. The expected output should be a sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0` (deterministic case).
- **Conclusion:** The test failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Actual vs. Expected:**
- **Actual:** `0.0000` (no output).
- **Expected:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with probability `1.0`.

**Error Location:**
- The issue lies in the `merge/3` predicate (lines 10â€“17). The predicate does not correctly handle the merging of sorted sublists.
- **Specific Issue:** The `merge/3` rules do not account for all possible cases of merging, leading to incomplete or incorrect results.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Scenario:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly splits the list into halves and recursively sorts them. However, the `merge/3` predicate fails to merge the sorted sublists correctly.
- **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined, ensuring termination.

**ProbLog Scenario:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so the probabilistic reasoning aspect is not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The sorting logic is correct, but the merging logic fails.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** No issues observed, but the incorrect merging logic overshadows this.
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect merging logic in `merge/3` | Sorting fails for all inputs. | Revise the `merge/3` predicate to correctly handle all merging cases.      |
| 2      | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Probabilistic reasoning not tested. | Add probabilistic facts or rules if required.                              |
| 3      | Non-list input not handled       | Code may crash for invalid inputs. | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` checks).                           |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation requires fixes in the `merge/3` predicate to function correctly. Edge cases and probabilistic features should be addressed if required by the use case.
