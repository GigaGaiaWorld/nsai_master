### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in Prolog, which is expected to sort a list using the merge sort technique. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with the requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**  
  ```
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Analysis:**  
  The test result indicates a failure. The probability of the query is reported as `0.0000`, which suggests that the query did not succeed or was not evaluated correctly. The expected result should be a sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000` (deterministic success).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:**  
  `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with probability `1.0000`.  
  - **Actual Result:** Probability `0.0000`.  

- **Error Location:**  
  The issue lies in the `merge/3` predicate, specifically in the recursive merging logic. The predicate does not correctly handle the merging of sublists, leading to incorrect or incomplete sorting.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly splits the list into halves and recursively sorts them. However, the `merge/3` predicate fails to merge the sorted sublists properly.  
  - **Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly for base cases (`[]` and `[X]`), but the merging logic is flawed.  

- **ProbLog Context:**  
  - The result `0.0000` suggests that the query is not satisfiable in the current probabilistic model. This is unexpected for a deterministic sorting algorithm.  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the code, so the issue is purely logical.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The sorting logic is correct, but the merging logic fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `merge/3` predicate incorrect    | Sorting fails                   | Fix merging logic in `merge/3`      |
| 2   | Non-list input not handled       | Runtime error                   | Add input validation                |
| 3   | No probabilistic facts/rules     | ProbLog result incorrect        | Add probabilistic context if needed |

---

#### **8. Code Fix Suggestion**  
Here is the corrected `merge/3` predicate:  
```prolog
merge([], L, L).
merge(L, [], L).
merge([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], [X|Zs]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Xs, [Y|Ys], Zs).
merge([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X|Xs], Ys, Zs).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation has a logical error in the `merge/3` predicate, causing the sorting to fail. The fix involves correcting the merging logic. The code does not use probabilistic features or DeepProbLog. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
