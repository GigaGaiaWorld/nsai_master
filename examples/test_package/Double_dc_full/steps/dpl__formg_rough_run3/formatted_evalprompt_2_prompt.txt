 % Problog Inference Result：

</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in Prolog, which is expected to sort a list using the merge sort technique. The evaluation aims to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with the requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**  
  ```
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Analysis:**  
  The test result indicates a failure. The probability of the query is reported as `0.0000`, which suggests that the query did not succeed or was not evaluated correctly. The expected result should be a sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000` (deterministic success).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:**  
  `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
  - **Expected Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with probability `1.0000`.  
  - **Actual Result:** Probability `0.0000`.  

- **Error Location:**  
  The issue lies in the `merge/3` predicate, specifically in the recursive merging logic. The predicate does not correctly handle the merging of sublists, leading to incorrect or incomplete sorting.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context:**  
  - The `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly splits the list into halves and recursively sorts them. However, the `merge/3` predicate fails to merge the sorted sublists properly.  
  - **Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly for base cases (`[]` and `[X]`), but the merging logic is flawed.  

- **ProbLog Context:**  
  - The result `0.0000` suggests that the query is not satisfiable in the current probabilistic model. This is unexpected for a deterministic sorting algorithm.  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the code, so the issue is purely logical.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The sorting logic is correct, but the merging logic fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | `merge/3` predicate incorrect    | Sorting fails                   | Fix merging logic in `merge/3`      |
| 2   | Non-list input not handled       | Runtime error                   | Add input validation                |
| 3   | No probabilistic facts/rules     | ProbLog result incorrect        | Add probabilistic context if needed |

---

#### **8. Code Fix Suggestion**  
Here is the corrected `merge/3` predicate:  
```prolog
merge([], L, L).
merge(L, [], L).
merge([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], [X|Zs]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Xs, [Y|Ys], Zs).
merge([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X|Xs], Ys, Zs).
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation has a logical error in the `merge/3` predicate, causing the sorting to fail. The fix involves correcting the merging logic. The code does not use probabilistic features or DeepProbLog. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.  

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
