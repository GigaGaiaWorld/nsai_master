### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog (Hash: 418D2062)**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the functional requirements of interpretability and classical reasoning.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed with the correct output and a probability of 1.0000.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation correctly sorts the input list and adheres to the expected behavior.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly implements the divide-and-conquer strategy of merge sort.  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination.  
  - The recursive calls (`merge_sort(Left, SortedLeft)` and `merge_sort(Right, SortedRight)`) are correctly structured.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the `split/4` predicate ensures the list is divided into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** The code does not involve neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement           | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning   | Satisfied   | The implementation correctly performs merge sort in a deterministic context. |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used  | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists may cause stack overflow, but this is a general limitation of Prolog's recursion.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** The `append/3` predicate is correctly defined, but its inclusion in the code block is redundant as it is a built-in predicate in most Prolog systems.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2   | Redundant `append/3`     | None (built-in predicate)       | Remove redundant definition.               |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The merge sort implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features. No DeepProbLog features are employed.
