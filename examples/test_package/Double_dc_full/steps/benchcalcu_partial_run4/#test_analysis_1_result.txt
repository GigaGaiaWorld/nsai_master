#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Cryptoaddition ProbLog Code: Functional and Logical Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The code enforces constraints such as unique digits, non-zero leading digits, and correct column-wise addition with carry propagation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each result satisfies the constraints of the cryptoaddition problem, and the probability of 1.0000 indicates deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures non-zero leading digits (lines 6–7).  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry (lines 12–16).  
- `all_different/1`: Enforces uniqueness of digits (lines 8–11).  

All expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are not used in this code, as it is purely classical.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to the problem constraints (unique digits, non-zero leading digits, and correct addition).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different/1` predicate terminates as the list shrinks with each recursive call.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic computations (e.g., `P(¬A)`) are involved.  

**DeepProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes list input for `query_sum/1`; no handling for invalid inputs.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to the number of digits (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is functionally correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are necessary for the given problem.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

**Final Note:** This evaluation confirms the correctness of the cryptoaddition ProbLog code. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation or extending the problem to include probabilistic constraints.
