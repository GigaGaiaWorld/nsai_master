### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements a rock-paper-scissors game, where two players submit lists of moves (`P1Moves` and `P2Moves`), and the system determines the winner based on the results of each round. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins two rounds (`paper` beats `rock` and `paper` beats `rock`), while Player 1 wins one round (`rock` beats `scissor`). The net score is `-1`, so `'Player 2'` is the winner.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The predicates `result/3`, `play/3`, and `compute_score/2` are correctly defined and function as intended.
- **Code Line Verification:**
  - `result/3`: Lines 10–18.
  - `play/3`: Lines 20–25.
  - `compute_score/2`: Lines 27–30.
  - `determine_winner/3`: Lines 32–34.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog:**
  - The logic is sound. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly handled with base cases (`[]`).
  - The `result/3` predicate accurately models the game rules.
- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The evaluation is purely deterministic.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Uneven Lists:** If `P1Moves` and `P2Moves` are of unequal length, the behavior is undefined (no explicit check).
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion could be problematic for very long lists, but this is unlikely in practice.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Uneven list lengths | Undefined behavior | Ensure lists are of equal length or handle padding. |
| 3      | Deep recursion | Potential stack overflow | Optimize for tail recursion or iterative solutions. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical ProbLog rules. However, edge cases like non-list inputs or uneven lists should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. The code is concise and logically sound for its intended purpose.
