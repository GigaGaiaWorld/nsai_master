### **Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules in ProbLog.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results show the following solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`:
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The solutions satisfy the constraints of the puzzle (unique digits, no leading zeros, and correct column-wise addition with carry).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures no leading zeros.
- `all_different/1`: Ensures all digits are unique.
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The logic is sound, and recursive predicates (e.g., `all_different/1`) terminate correctly.
  - The constraints (`leftdigit`, `all_different`, and `sumdigit`) are correctly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly enforced.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.
  - **Non-list Input:** The input is hardcoded as a list, so no issues arise.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal (digits 0-9), so performance is not a concern.
