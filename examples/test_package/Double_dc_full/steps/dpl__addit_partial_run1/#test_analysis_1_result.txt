### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of `digit/2` facts representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0 to 9). It also includes an `addition/3` rule to perform addition on the digits represented by two images. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```prolog
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
```
**Result:**  
```
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected output (`5 + 6 = 11`).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures** were detected in the provided code.  
- **Expansion Predicates:** The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so no verification is required for these.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The `addition/3` rule is logically correct. It retrieves the digits associated with the input images (`digit(X,A)` and `digit(Y,B)`) and computes their sum (`Z is A + B`).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The code does not involve recursion, so termination is not a concern.  

##### **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The `digit/2` facts are deterministic (probability 1.0000), so no probabilistic rules (e.g., negation or implication) are applied.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:**  
   - Met. The `addition/3` rule correctly performs classical arithmetic addition.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
   - Not applicable, as the code uses only deterministic facts.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:**  
   - Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code does not handle cases where `digit/2` facts are missing for input images (e.g., `digit(img_10,10)`).  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable, as the code does not process lists.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not applicable, as the code does not involve recursion.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No handling of undefined `digit/2` facts | Potential runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add validation or default cases for missing facts. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog features not used | Limited functionality for neural-symbolic tasks | Consider integrating `nn/3` for advanced use cases. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The provided ProbLog code is functionally correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Enhancements could include input validation and integration of probabilistic or neural network components for broader applicability.
