### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of a flap under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes for reaching a goal position or encountering an overrun exception. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code and its test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the model.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` (for `T = 1..5`) are as follows:

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low but non-zero.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the expansion predicates (e.g., `legal_flap_position/1`, `actuator_strength/2`, `use_actuator/2`, `wind_effect/2`) are consistent with the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive termination condition is satisfied by the base case `flap_position(0,6)` and the termination at `at(5)`. The rules for `flap_position/2`, `overrun_exception/1`, and `goal_reached/1` are logically sound.
- **Probabilistic Correctness:** The probabilities of `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). The results reflect the combined effects of actuator choice and wind strength.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules for flap movement and exceptions are correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic facts and their interactions are correctly modeled.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The system handles illegal flap positions (`legal_flap_position/1`) and overrun exceptions (`overrun_exception/1`) correctly.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  - Recursive performance is efficient due to the limited time steps (`at(5)`).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:** The ProbLog code for the aircraft flap controller is well-designed and passes all tests. The probabilistic and logical components are correctly implemented, and no edge cases or failures were identified.
