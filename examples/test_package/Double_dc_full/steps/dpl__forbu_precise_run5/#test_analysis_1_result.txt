### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the implementation against the provided test case.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.  
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge-case handling.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```problog
query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```problog
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed with the expected output.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The following predicates were verified:  
- `swap/3`: Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on their values.  
- `bubble/3`: Recursively processes the list to move the largest element to the end.  
- `bubblesort/3`: Implements the recursive sorting logic.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `swap/3` predicate correctly implements the comparison logic (`X > Y` for swapping).  
  - The `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3` predicates ensure recursive termination by reducing the list size in each iteration.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The base case `bubblesort([], L, L)` ensures termination when the input list is empty.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **"DeepProbLog feature not used."**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the bubble sort algorithm.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion could be inefficient for large lists, but this is inherent to bubble sort.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be handled in a production environment.  

**Word Count:** ~400 words.
