### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 1, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected behavior for each stack operation.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are logically sound. For example, `stack_op(pop, [X|Rest], Rest)` correctly removes the top element of the stack.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate ensures termination by recursively processing the list until it is empty.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations are correctly implemented and tested.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate may face performance issues with large lists due to its recursive nature.  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not relevant here, as the code does not use expansion predicates.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input for stack operations | Runtime error | Add input validation for stack operations. |
| 2 | Performance of `insertion_sort/2` with large lists | Slow execution | Optimize sorting algorithm for larger datasets. |
| 3 | No probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features | Limited scope | Extend functionality if probabilistic reasoning is required. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Note:** The code is well-implemented for classical stack operations but could benefit from additional robustness (e.g., input validation) and optimization for larger datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
