### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot interacts with a key in a dynamic environment. The robot can move between locations, pick up the key, and drop it based on probabilistic events (e.g., slipping, fumbling). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, given the probabilistic rules and actions defined in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive predicates (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) correctly terminate and propagate state changes over time.  
- The negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used appropriately to model conditions like "not dropping the key" or "not executing a goto action."  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilistic facts (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`) comply with the rule `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`. For example, `pickup_fails(T)` is implicitly `0.3` when `pickup_succeeds(T)` is `0.7`.  
- The implications (e.g., `drops(key,T)`) correctly combine probabilities, such as `P(drops(key,T)) = P(slippery(key,T)) * P(drop_slippery_key(T)) + P(¬slippery(key,T)) * P(fumbles_key(T))`.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key interactions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed as expected.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases such as:  
  - No action (`\+ goto_action(T)`).  
  - Key dropping due to slippery conditions or fumbling.  
- Performance: The recursion depth is manageable for the given scenario.

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the classical logic is correctly implemented. No issues were identified during the evaluation.
