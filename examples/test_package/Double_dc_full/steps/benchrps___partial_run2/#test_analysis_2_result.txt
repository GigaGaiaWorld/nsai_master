### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, including the rules for determining wins, losses, and draws. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner, with a probability of 1.0000, which aligns with the game's rules.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  All predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the test results match the expected outcomes.  
  - **Key Predicates Verified**:  
    - `move/1`: Correctly defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
    - `beats/2`: Correctly defines the win-lose relationships.  
    - `result/3`: Correctly computes the outcome of each round.  
    - `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Correctly handle recursion and score computation.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The rules for determining the game's outcome (`result/3`) are logically sound. Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly.  
  - **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as empty lists (`play([], [], [])`) and draws (`result(X, X, draw)`).  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game's logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid gestures. Non-list inputs or invalid gestures would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game scenarios.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified at this time.
