</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, including the rules for determining wins, losses, and draws. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner, with a probability of 1.0000, which aligns with the game's rules.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  All predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the test results match the expected outcomes.  
  - **Key Predicates Verified**:  
    - `move/1`: Correctly defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
    - `beats/2`: Correctly defines the win-lose relationships.  
    - `result/3`: Correctly computes the outcome of each round.  
    - `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Correctly handle recursion and score computation.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The rules for determining the game's outcome (`result/3`) are logically sound. Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate correctly.  
  - **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as empty lists (`play([], [], [])`) and draws (`result(X, X, draw)`).  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game's logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid gestures. Non-list inputs or invalid gestures would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game scenarios.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified at this time.  

---

**Word Count**: ~350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
