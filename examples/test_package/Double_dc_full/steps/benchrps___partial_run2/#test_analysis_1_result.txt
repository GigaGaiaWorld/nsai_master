### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including the definition of moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`), win-lose relationships (`beats/2`), and a scoring mechanism (`compute_score/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 1 plays `[rock, rock, rock]`, and Player 2 plays `[paper, paper, scissor]`. The outcomes are:
    - `rock vs. paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock vs. paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock vs. scissor`: Player 1 wins.
  - The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins), which matches the expected result.
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3`) function as intended.
- **Code Line Verification:**
  - `move/1`: Lines 1–3.
  - `beats/2`: Lines 4–6.
  - `result/3`: Lines 7–12.
  - `play/3`: Lines 13–17.
  - `compute_score/2`: Lines 18–21.
  - `determine_winner/3`: Lines 22–26.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `result/3` are logically sound. The recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` is correctly handled.
  - **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as empty lists (`play([], [], [])`) and draws (`result(X, X, draw)`).
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The current implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `0.5::move(rock)`). Thus, probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The game logic and scoring are correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this implementation.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms) are not handled and may cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.
  - **Performance:** The implementation is efficient for small to moderate input sizes.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Non-list inputs not handled | May cause runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2   | No probabilistic facts used | Limits flexibility | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |
| 3   | DeepProbLog not utilized | No neural integration | Consider adding neural predicates for advanced features. |

#### **Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation is robust for its intended purpose but could be enhanced with input validation and probabilistic extensions if required.
