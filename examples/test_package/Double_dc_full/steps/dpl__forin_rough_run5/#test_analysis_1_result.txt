### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with the functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as the output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `insertion_sort/2` predicate correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])` and the recursive case `insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted)`.
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Empty List**: Handled by the base case.  
  - **Non-list Input**: Not explicitly handled, but Prolog's type system will raise an error if non-list input is provided.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
- **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very large lists due to recursive calls.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled  | May cause runtime errors       | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion performance  | May slow down for large lists  | Consider iterative implementation. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is correct for classical ProbLog scenarios and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
