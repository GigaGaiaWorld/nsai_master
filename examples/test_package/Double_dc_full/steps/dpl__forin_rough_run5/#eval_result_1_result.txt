{
  "HASH": "501F546D",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. Minor robustness concerns: (1) Non-list input not handled, (2) Deep recursion may impact performance for large lists.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` check). 2. Consider iterative implementation for large lists (though Prolog typically optimizes tail recursion).",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
}
``` 

### Explanation:
- **ErrorSummary**: The code passes all functional tests and correctly implements insertion sort. The noted concerns are non-critical optimizations.
- **SuggestedFix**: Optional improvements (not required for correctness).
- **NeedRegenerate**: `false` because the core functionality is correct, and the improvements are optional enhancements.
