    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert(H, SortedTail, Sorted).

<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with the functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as the output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `insertion_sort/2` predicate correctly implements the insertion sort algorithm. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])` and the recursive case `insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted)`.
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Empty List**: Handled by the base case.  
  - **Non-list Input**: Not explicitly handled, but Prolog's type system will raise an error if non-list input is provided.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
- **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very large lists due to recursive calls.  
- **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates are used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled  | May cause runtime errors       | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion performance  | May slow down for large lists  | Consider iterative implementation. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is correct for classical ProbLog scenarios and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for non-list inputs and may face performance issues with large lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
