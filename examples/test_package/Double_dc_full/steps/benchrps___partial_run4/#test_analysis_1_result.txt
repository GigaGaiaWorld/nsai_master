### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game, including the definition of moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`), the win-lose relationships (`beats/2`), and the logic to determine the game's outcome (`result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, `determine_winner/3`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000.
  - **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates and rules function as intended.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, `determine_winner/3`.
- **Expansion Predicates:** Not applicable (no `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc., used in this code).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `result/3` correctly handle the win, lose, and draw cases. Recursive predicates (`play/3`, `compute_score/2`) terminate properly.
  - **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as empty lists (`play([], [], [])`) and draws (`result(X, X, draw)`).
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this code. The test result is deterministic (probability 1.0000).
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves. Non-list inputs or invalid moves would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
The ProbLog implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game is logically correct and passes the provided test case. The code adheres to classical ProbLog rules and handles edge cases appropriately. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, and the implementation is robust for its intended purpose.
