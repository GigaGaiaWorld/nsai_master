### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including the rules for determining wins, losses, and draws. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because they have two wins (paper beats rock, scissor beats paper) and one loss (rock beats scissor), resulting in a net score of `1` for player 2.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The logical correctness of the rules (`beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3`) is verified.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` by the base cases (`play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`).  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`), so probabilistic reasoning checks are not applicable.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes results as expected.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Invalid inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers) would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.  
  - **Undefined Moves**: The code does not handle moves outside the defined set (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No probabilistic facts/rules | Limited to classical reasoning | Add probabilistic rules if needed. |
| 2      | No DeepProbLog features | No neural integration | Consider adding `nn/3` for hybrid reasoning. |
| 3      | No input validation | Potential runtime errors | Add checks for valid moves. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The implementation is correct for classical reasoning but lacks probabilistic and neural network features. Edge cases like input validation should be addressed for robustness.
