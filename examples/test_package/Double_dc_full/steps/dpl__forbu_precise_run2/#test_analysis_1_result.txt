### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, analyzing test results, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested:**  
  `query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).`  
- **Result:**  
  `forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `swap/3`: Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on comparison.  
  - `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3`: Recursively sort the list and terminate as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `swap/3` predicate correctly implements the comparison logic (`X > Y` for swapping).  
  - The `bubble/3` predicate ensures the largest element is moved to the end of the list in each iteration.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively processes the remaining list until it is empty.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The base case `bubblesort([], L, L)` ensures termination when the input list is empty.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - Not used (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...`, or related calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `bubblesort([], L, L)`.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists.

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct for classical ProbLog scenarios. For probabilistic or DeepProbLog extensions, additional features would need to be incorporated. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be handled gracefully in future iterations.
