### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including the rules for determining the outcome of moves and calculating the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W).`  
- **Result**:  
  `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`  

**Verification**:  
- The query returns the expected result (`player2` wins) with a probability of 1.0000, which aligns with the game rules.  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `outcome/3`: Correctly defines the win-lose-draw rules.  
  - `play/3`: Recursively processes lists of moves and results.  
  - `compute_score/2`: Accurately calculates the score from results.  
  - `determine_winner/3`: Correctly determines the winner based on the score.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The rules for `beats/2` and `outcome/3` are logically sound and cover all possible move combinations.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The `play/3` predicate terminates correctly when the input lists are empty.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  

- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **Not Used**: The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes lists as input for `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game scenarios.
