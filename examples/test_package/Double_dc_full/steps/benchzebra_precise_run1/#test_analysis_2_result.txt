### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This evaluation analyzes the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, adherence to requirements, and error handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails to execute due to an error related to the `member/2` predicate. The error message indicates that no clauses are found for `member/2` at line 4. This is a critical failure, as the `member/2` predicate is essential for validating the constraints of the puzzle.

**Failed Query:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails with the error: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1`.

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**
- **Expected:** The query should return a valid arrangement of houses satisfying all constraints.
- **Actual:** The query fails due to the undefined `member/2` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** Line 4
- **Issue:** The `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code, despite being used extensively in the constraints.

**Code Block with Issue:**
```prolog
member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
member(house(spanish, _, dog, _, _), Houses),
...
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented, but the absence of the `member/2` predicate prevents execution.
- **Recursive Termination:** Not applicable here, as the failure is due to a missing predicate.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** Not applicable, as the puzzle is purely deterministic (classical Prolog).
- **DeepProbLog Features:** Not used in this implementation.

**Root Cause:** The `member/2` predicate is a built-in or user-defined predicate in Prolog, but it is not provided in the code. The error occurs because ProbLog cannot resolve the predicate.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The absence of the `member/2` predicate is a critical oversight.
  - Non-list input or deep recursion is not tested due to the early failure.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Execution fails                 | Define or import the `member/2` predicate. |
| 2      | Missing predicate implementation | Constraints cannot be validated | Ensure all required predicates are defined. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is logically sound but fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. To resolve this, the `member/2` predicate must be defined or imported. Once this is addressed, the puzzle should execute correctly, validating all constraints. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
