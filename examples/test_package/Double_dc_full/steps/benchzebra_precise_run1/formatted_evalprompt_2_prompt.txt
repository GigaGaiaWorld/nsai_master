<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This evaluation analyzes the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, adherence to requirements, and error handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails to execute due to an error related to the `member/2` predicate. The error message indicates that no clauses are found for `member/2` at line 4. This is a critical failure, as the `member/2` predicate is essential for validating the constraints of the puzzle.

**Failed Query:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails with the error: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1`.

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**
- **Expected:** The query should return a valid arrangement of houses satisfying all constraints.
- **Actual:** The query fails due to the undefined `member/2` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** Line 4
- **Issue:** The `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code, despite being used extensively in the constraints.

**Code Block with Issue:**
```prolog
member(house(english, red, _, _, _), Houses),
member(house(spanish, _, dog, _, _), Houses),
...
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented, but the absence of the `member/2` predicate prevents execution.
- **Recursive Termination:** Not applicable here, as the failure is due to a missing predicate.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** Not applicable, as the puzzle is purely deterministic (classical Prolog).
- **DeepProbLog Features:** Not used in this implementation.

**Root Cause:** The `member/2` predicate is a built-in or user-defined predicate in Prolog, but it is not provided in the code. The error occurs because ProbLog cannot resolve the predicate.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The absence of the `member/2` predicate is a critical oversight.
  - Non-list input or deep recursion is not tested due to the early failure.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Execution fails                 | Define or import the `member/2` predicate. |
| 2      | Missing predicate implementation | Constraints cannot be validated | Ensure all required predicates are defined. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is logically sound but fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. To resolve this, the `member/2` predicate must be defined or imported. Once this is addressed, the puzzle should execute correctly, validating all constraints. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation. 

**Word Count:** 350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
