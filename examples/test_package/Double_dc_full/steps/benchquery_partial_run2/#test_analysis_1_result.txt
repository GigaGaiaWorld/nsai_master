### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Population Density Query in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population density. The density is calculated as `(population * 100) // area`, and the query identifies pairs where the density of one country is slightly higher than the other but within a 5% margin (`20*D1 < 21*D2`).  

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the test results.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic correctness of the code.  
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
1. `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
2. `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
3. `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
4. `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- All test cases pass as they correctly identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population density.  
- The results align with the expected behavior of the `query_pop/1` predicate.  

**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned the expected values with a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic correctness.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density using integer division (`//`).  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that `D1 > D2` and checks the 5% margin condition (`20*D1 < 21*D2`).  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - No recursion is used in the code, so termination is not an issue.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::fact`). All facts are deterministic.  
- No implications or negations are used, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog Analysis:**  
- **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:**  
   - Fully met. The code correctly implements classical logic to query and compare population densities.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
   - Not applicable, as the code is deterministic.  
3. **Neural Network Integration:**  
   - Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:**  
  - All predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`, `query_pop/1`) are defined.  
- **Non-list Input:**  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate expects a list of four elements. Non-list inputs would fail, but this is not tested.  
- **Performance:**  
  - The code is efficient for the given dataset, but scalability to larger datasets could be tested.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The code is logically correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors or edge cases were identified in the provided test results.  

**Word Count:** 450
