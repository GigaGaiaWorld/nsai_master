    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:12.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`coin(C)` with a probability of 0.8 for heads) a specified number of times (`CNT`) and accumulate the total number of heads (`S`). The code uses recursion to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any logical or probabilistic errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:12.
```

- **Failed Query**: `total(S)`  
  - **Expected Result**: A probabilistic distribution of the total number of heads after 4 coin tosses.  
  - **Actual Result**: Error due to an undefined predicate `->/2`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: The error occurs in the recursive rule `coins_r/3` at line 8:12.  
- **Root Cause**: The predicate `->/2` (implication) is not defined or incorrectly used in the context of ProbLog. ProbLog does not natively support the `->/2` operator in the way classical Prolog does.  
- **Code Block with Error**:  
  ```prolog
  (heads -> NewSC is SC + 1 ; NewSC is SC)
  ```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive termination condition (`CNT > 0`) is correctly defined.  
  - The logic for accumulating heads (`NewSC is SC + 1`) is sound, but the use of `->/2` is problematic.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not comply with ProbLog's probabilistic rules. The `->/2` operator is not a valid ProbLog construct. Instead, probabilistic implications should be modeled using `if-then-else` constructs or auxiliary predicates.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - **Not Used**: The code does not involve any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met, but the use of `->/2` is incorrect.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met due to the misuse of `->/2`.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle edge cases such as `CNT = 0` explicitly (though the base case is defined).  
  - The probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is correctly defined, but the recursive logic is flawed.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->/2` predicate  | Recursive logic fails           | Replace `->/2` with a valid ProbLog construct (e.g., `if-then-else`).     |
| 2   | Probabilistic implication   | Incorrect probabilistic results | Model implications using auxiliary predicates or ProbLog's native syntax.  |
| 3   | Edge case handling          | Potential runtime errors        | Explicitly handle `CNT = 0` and invalid inputs.                           |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The code fails due to the misuse of the `->/2` operator, which is not supported in ProbLog. To fix this, replace the problematic construct with a valid ProbLog alternative. Additionally, ensure the probabilistic logic aligns with ProbLog's rules. The functional requirements are not fully met, but the issues are localized and fixable.  

**Word Count**: ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
