### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin `CNT` times and accumulate the number of heads (`S`). The code uses recursion to sample the coin tosses and count the heads. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a **non-ground probabilistic clause** error. The error occurs at line 1, column 5, where the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not properly grounded.  

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Error:** `NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.`  

No other queries were executed due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate/Rule:**  
  - `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).`  
  - **Location:** Line 1, Column 5.  
- **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not grounded, meaning the variable `C` is unbound when the probabilistic fact is evaluated. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be grounded (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic in `coins_r/3` is correct for counting heads, but the failure occurs before this logic is executed.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT` reaches 0.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The error arises because the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not grounded. ProbLog cannot evaluate unbound probabilistic facts.  
- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance:** The code does not violate probabilistic rules like `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)` because the error prevents execution.  

**DeepProbLog Feature:**  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but the error prevents execution).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to the non-ground probabilistic clause.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-Ground Probabilistic Facts:** The primary issue is the unbound variable `C` in `coin(C)`.  
- **Recursive Performance:** Not evaluated due to the error.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic clause | Prevents execution of the query | Ground the variable `C` in `coin(C)` by defining it explicitly or binding it in the query. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The code fails due to a non-ground probabilistic clause, which is a fundamental issue in ProbLog. Fixing this requires grounding the variable `C` in the probabilistic fact `coin(C)`. Once resolved, the recursive logic should work as intended. No DeepProbLog features are used in this code.
