</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on a set of given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, adherence to requirements, and error handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails during execution with the following error:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Key Observations:**
- The error indicates that the predicate `member/2` is not defined in the ProbLog program.
- No test results are available due to the failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The entire program fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined.
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at line 4, where `member/2` is first used.
- **Impact:** The program cannot proceed without this predicate, as it is essential for checking membership in the list of houses.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The `member/2` predicate is a standard Prolog predicate, but it is not included in the provided ProbLog code. ProbLog requires all predicates to be explicitly defined or imported.
  - The recursive termination of other predicates (e.g., `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) is logically correct, but their functionality is irrelevant without `member/2`.

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents the program from running.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The absence of `member/2` is a critical oversight.
  - The program assumes the input is a list of houses, but no checks are in place for non-list inputs.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate     | Program cannot execute          | Define `member/2` or import it.    |
| 2      | No input validation              | Potential runtime errors        | Add checks for list input.          |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fixes**
1. **Define `member/2`:**
   ```prolog
   member(X, [X|_]).
   member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
   ```
2. **Add Input Validation:**
   Ensure the input to `houses/1` is a list of 5 houses.

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The current implementation fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Once this is resolved, the program should be re-evaluated for logical correctness and adherence to the puzzle's constraints. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this code. 

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
