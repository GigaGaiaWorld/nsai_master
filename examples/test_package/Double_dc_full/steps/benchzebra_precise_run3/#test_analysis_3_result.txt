### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given constraints. This evaluation analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on logical correctness, test results, and adherence to ProbLog syntax and semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided code fails during execution with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Key Observations:**  
- The error indicates that the predicate `member/2` is undefined in the ProbLog context.  
- No queries were successfully executed due to this critical failure.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** The entire `zebra/1` predicate fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined.  
- **Code Location:** The error occurs at line 4, where `member/2` is first used.  
- **Expected Behavior:** The `member/2` predicate should be defined to check if an element exists in a list.  

**Missing Definition:**  
```prolog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
```

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The logical structure of the puzzle is correct, but the implementation lacks the necessary auxiliary predicate (`member/2`).  
  - Recursive termination is not applicable here because the predicate is missing entirely.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and unrelated to probabilistic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical structure is correct, but missing predicate).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The absence of `member/2` is a critical oversight.  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not tested due to the early failure.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Entire program fails to execute | Define `member/2` as shown above.   |
| 2      | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic constraints if needed. |

---

**Word Count:** ~350 words  

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Once this is resolved, the logical structure of the puzzle should work as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are currently utilized.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Define the `member/2` predicate.  
2. Re-run the tests to verify correctness.  
3. Consider adding probabilistic constraints if needed.
