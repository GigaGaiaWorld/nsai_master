### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in Prolog, which is tested using a query to sort the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the requirements of interpretability.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was executed:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Verification:**  
- The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `merge_sort/2` and `merge/3` function as intended.  

**Expansion Predicates Verification:**  
- The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.).  
- **Conclusion:** No expansion predicates are required or used in this implementation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly splits the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the results.  
  - The `merge/3` predicate handles the merging of two sorted lists as expected.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination.  
  - The recursive calls reduce the problem size, guaranteeing termination.  

**ProbLog Analysis:**  
- The implementation does not involve probabilistic facts or rules.  
- **Conclusion:** The code operates purely in a classical Prolog context.  

**DeepProbLog Analysis:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
- **Conclusion:** DeepProbLog feature not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.  
- **Performance:** The recursive implementation may face performance issues with very large lists due to stack usage.  

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
1. Add input validation to handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
2. Optimize the recursive calls for better performance with large lists.

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation for list type.        |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used        | Limited to classical reasoning  | Consider extending for probabilistic tasks. |

**Final Verdict:** The implementation of `merge_sort/2` is correct and meets the classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks support for probabilistic reasoning and edge-case handling. No failures were detected in the provided test case.
