### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog: Error Localization and Root Cause Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog, aiming to sort a list of integers. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's requirements, including classical and probabilistic reasoning.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result**: The test failed with a `CallModeError` for the `length/2` predicate.  
- **Expected Result**: The query should return the sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.  
- **Actual Result**: Error due to invalid argument types for `length/2`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `length/2`  
  - **Code Line**: Line 12 (`length(FirstHalf, Half)`)  
  - **Issue**: The `length/2` predicate expects a fixed list or a positive integer, but `FirstHalf` is uninstantiated at this point, violating the expected argument types.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenario**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `merge_sort/2` logic is correct in principle, but the implementation fails due to improper use of `length/2`.  
  - The recursive termination conditions (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion terminates correctly for base cases (empty list or single-element list).  
  - The issue arises in the recursive case where `length/2` is called with an uninstantiated variable.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario**  
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and unrelated to probabilistic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  - The logic for merge sort is correct, but the implementation fails due to a syntactic error.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  - Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  - Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**:  
  - The recursion depth is logarithmic, so performance is acceptable for typical inputs.  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  - The `append/3` predicate is correctly defined but not used in the failing test.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Invalid argument types for `length/2` | Prevents sorting | Instantiate `FirstHalf` before calling `length/2` or use `length/2` with a fixed list. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | May cause runtime errors | Add input validation for list type. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation fails due to a `CallModeError` in the `length/2` predicate. The error is localized to the recursive case where `FirstHalf` is uninstantiated. The fix involves ensuring proper instantiation of variables before calling `length/2`. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
