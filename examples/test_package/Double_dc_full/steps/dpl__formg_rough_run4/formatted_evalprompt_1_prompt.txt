</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog: Error Localization and Root Cause Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog, aiming to sort a list of integers. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's requirements, including classical and probabilistic reasoning.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result**: The test failed with a `CallModeError` for the `length/2` predicate.  
- **Expected Result**: The query should return the sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.  
- **Actual Result**: Error due to invalid argument types for `length/2`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `length/2`  
  - **Code Line**: Line 12 (`length(FirstHalf, Half)`)  
  - **Issue**: The `length/2` predicate expects a fixed list or a positive integer, but `FirstHalf` is uninstantiated at this point, violating the expected argument types.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenario**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `merge_sort/2` logic is correct in principle, but the implementation fails due to improper use of `length/2`.  
  - The recursive termination conditions (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) are correctly defined.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion terminates correctly for base cases (empty list or single-element list).  
  - The issue arises in the recursive case where `length/2` is called with an uninstantiated variable.  

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario**  
- **Probabilistic Facts and Rules**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and unrelated to probabilistic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  - The logic for merge sort is correct, but the implementation fails due to a syntactic error.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  - Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  - Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**:  
  - The recursion depth is logarithmic, so performance is acceptable for typical inputs.  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  - The `append/3` predicate is correctly defined but not used in the failing test.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Invalid argument types for `length/2` | Prevents sorting | Instantiate `FirstHalf` before calling `length/2` or use `length/2` with a fixed list. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | May cause runtime errors | Add input validation for list type. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation fails due to a `CallModeError` in the `length/2` predicate. The error is localized to the recursive case where `FirstHalf` is uninstantiated. The fix involves ensuring proper instantiation of variables before calling `length/2`. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.  

**Word Count**: 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
