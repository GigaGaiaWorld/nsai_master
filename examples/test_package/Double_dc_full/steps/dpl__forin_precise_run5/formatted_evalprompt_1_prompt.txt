</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on verifying test results, logical correctness, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability of correctness is 1.0000, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The implementation correctly adheres to the requirements:  
  1. Recursively sorts the tail list.  
  2. Inserts the head element into the sorted sublist.  
- **Code Verification**:  
  - The predicate `insert_element/3` handles edge cases (e.g., inserting into an empty list) and correctly places elements in ascending order.  
  - No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used, as this is a classical Prolog problem.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Correctness**:  
  - The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], []).`).  
  - The `insert_element/3` predicate ensures logical correctness by comparing elements and placing them in the correct position.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The result is deterministic, as evidenced by the probability of 1.0000.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog recursion and insertion.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause a type error.  
  - **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the base case `insertion_sort([], []).`.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists, but this is inherent to the algorithm's design.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words  

**Final Verdict**: The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No failures or issues were detected. The code is robust for classical Prolog sorting tasks but does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features or DeepProbLog capabilities.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
