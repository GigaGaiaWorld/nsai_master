### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on verifying test results, logical correctness, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability of correctness is 1.0000, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The implementation correctly adheres to the requirements:  
  1. Recursively sorts the tail list.  
  2. Inserts the head element into the sorted sublist.  
- **Code Verification**:  
  - The predicate `insert_element/3` handles edge cases (e.g., inserting into an empty list) and correctly places elements in ascending order.  
  - No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used, as this is a classical Prolog problem.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Correctness**:  
  - The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], []).`).  
  - The `insert_element/3` predicate ensures logical correctness by comparing elements and placing them in the correct position.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The result is deterministic, as evidenced by the probability of 1.0000.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog recursion and insertion.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause a type error.  
  - **Empty List**: Handled correctly by the base case `insertion_sort([], []).`.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists, but this is inherent to the algorithm's design.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words  

**Final Verdict**: The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No failures or issues were detected. The code is robust for classical Prolog sorting tasks but does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features or DeepProbLog capabilities.
