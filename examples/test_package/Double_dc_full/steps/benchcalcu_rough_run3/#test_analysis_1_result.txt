#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digits for the variables `A, B, C, D, E` such that the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` holds. The code uses predicates like `digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, and `sumdigit/5` to enforce constraints and simulate column-wise addition. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results show the following solutions for `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`:
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each solution satisfies the constraints of the puzzle, and the probabilities are correctly reported as `1.0000`, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** All test cases adhere to the constraints defined in the predicates:
  - `leftdigit/1` ensures the first digit of multi-digit numbers is not zero.
  - `all_different/1` enforces uniqueness of digits.
  - `sumdigit/5` correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The logical correctness of the predicates is verified. For example:
    - `sumdigit/5` correctly handles carry propagation and digit summation.
    - Recursive predicates like `all_different/1` terminate correctly for finite lists.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The problem is deterministic, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not directly applicable here. However, the results correctly reflect the deterministic nature of the puzzle.

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly enforced.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not explicitly required, but the deterministic results are correctly reported.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases such as:
    - Multi-digit numbers not starting with zero.
    - Unique digits in the solution.
    - Correct carry propagation in addition.
  - No performance issues were observed due to the small problem size.

| 1      | None    | None   | None       |
