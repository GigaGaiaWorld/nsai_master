### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with the specified requirements.
- Analyze edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query and its result are as follows:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **No failures detected.** The implementation adheres to the requirements:
  1. **Length and Recursive Boundary:** The `length/2` predicate ensures the list is split only if its length exceeds 1.
  2. **Splitting and Merging:** The `split_list/3` and `merge/3` predicates correctly handle the splitting and merging of sublists.
  3. **Recursive Sorting:** The recursive calls to `merge_sort/2` process the left and right sublists independently.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The implementation is logically sound. The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) ensure termination, and the recursive calls correctly divide and conquer the sorting problem.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates because the list is split into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **No Probabilistic Facts or Negations:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations. It is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** There are no calls to `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`, or other DeepProbLog features.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The merge sort algorithm is correctly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists may cause stack overflow, but this is a general limitation of Prolog-style recursion.
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Stack overflow | Consider iterative approaches or tail recursion optimization. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The merge sort implementation in ProbLog is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. However, it lacks handling for non-list inputs and may face performance issues with very large lists. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Addressing the edge cases would further improve robustness.
