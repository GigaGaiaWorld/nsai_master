### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to the specified requirements, and ensure it handles edge cases and probabilistic scenarios appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures** were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `merge_sort/2`: Correctly implements recursive splitting and merging.  
  - `split_list/3`: Splits the list into two halves.  
  - `merge/3`: Merges two sorted lists into one.  
  - `append/3`: Handles list concatenation.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination for empty and single-element lists.  
  - The recursive splitting (`split_list/3`) and merging (`merge/3`) are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion terminates because the list is split into smaller halves until the base cases are reached.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`).  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - **Not used** in this implementation (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...`, or similar calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
1. **Classical Reasoning**:  
   - Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list using classical Prolog predicates.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
   - Not applicable in this case (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration**:  
   - Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers).  
- **Performance**:  
  - The recursive splitting and merging are efficient for typical use cases, but deep recursion could impact performance for very large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  - No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, `implies/2`, etc.) are used or required.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Performance degradation | Consider iterative approaches for very large lists. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation in ProbLog is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks handling for non-list inputs and could benefit from performance optimizations for large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
