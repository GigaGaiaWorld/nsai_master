### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The expressions include numbers and operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The evaluation involves verifying the correctness of the parsing logic, ensuring recursive termination, and validating the probabilistic and classical reasoning aspects.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:
  - The expected result for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` is `-13.6667`.
  - The actual result (`0.0000`) does not match the expected value.
  - **Conclusion**: The test fails.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The query involving the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7`.
- **Problematic Predicate**: The `parse/2` predicate for handling division (`/`) is missing. The current implementation only includes the addition case (`+`).
- **Code Line**: The `parse/2` predicate for division is not defined, leading to incorrect evaluation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. It only handles addition (`+`) and single numbers but lacks rules for subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
  - The recursive termination condition (`parse([N], R)`) is correct, but the intermediate steps are incomplete.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The parsing logic is incomplete.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursive performance is not tested due to the small input size.
  - Undefined operators (e.g., division) cause failures.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `parse/2` for division   | Incorrect evaluation of division | Add `parse([N1, / | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 / R2, almost_equal(R, R). |
| 2      | Missing `parse/2` for subtraction | Incorrect evaluation of subtraction | Add `parse([N1, - | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 - R2, almost_equal(R, R). |
| 3      | Missing `parse/2` for multiplication | Incorrect evaluation of multiplication | Add `parse([N1, * | T], R) :- parse(T, R2), R is N1 * R2, almost_equal(R, R). |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and clear.  
**Conclusion**: The code requires additional `parse/2` predicates for all operators to meet the functional requirements. Edge cases and recursive performance should also be addressed.
