### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of a flap from an initial position to a target position, considering actuator strength, wind effects, and probabilistic choices. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:

| Query                | Probability |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but possible.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:
- `attempted_flap_position/2`: Correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and the previous position.
- `goal_reached/1` and `overrun_exception/1`: Properly evaluate the system's state at each time step.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code adheres to probabilistic rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`: For example, `wind(weak)` and `wind(strong)` are complementary.
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`: Implicitly handled in the probabilistic choices (e.g., `use_actuator/2`).

##### **DeepProbLog Scenarios**
- **Neural Network Integration:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly models the flap movement and goal evaluation.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed correctly, and the system accounts for uncertainties (e.g., wind effects, actuator choice).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the code.
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The test results confirm its correctness, and no edge cases were overlooked. No improvements are necessary at this time.
