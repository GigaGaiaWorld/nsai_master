<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of a flap from an initial position to a target position, considering actuator strength, wind effects, and probabilistic choices. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:

| Query                | Probability |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but possible.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:
- `attempted_flap_position/2`: Correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and the previous position.
- `goal_reached/1` and `overrun_exception/1`: Properly evaluate the system's state at each time step.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code adheres to probabilistic rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`: For example, `wind(weak)` and `wind(strong)` are complementary.
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`: Implicitly handled in the probabilistic choices (e.g., `use_actuator/2`).

##### **DeepProbLog Scenarios**
- **Neural Network Integration:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly models the flap movement and goal evaluation.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed correctly, and the system accounts for uncertainties (e.g., wind effects, actuator choice).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the code.
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), so performance is not an issue.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

---

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The test results confirm its correctness, and no edge cases were overlooked. No improvements are necessary at this time.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
