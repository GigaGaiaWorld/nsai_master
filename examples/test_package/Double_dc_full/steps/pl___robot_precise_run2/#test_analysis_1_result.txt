### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot interacts with a key in a dynamic environment. The robot can perform actions like `goto`, `pickup`, and `putdown`, and the key's state (e.g., slippery) affects the outcomes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Probability Result |
|-------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4331 |
| `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.9000 |
| `at(robot, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0900 |
| `at(robot, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0100 |
| `at(key, loc2, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.5670 |
| `at(key, loc1, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.4330 |
| `at(key, loc0, s(s(s(0))))` | 0.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, given the probabilistic rules and actions defined.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. Below is a verification of key predicates:  

- **`at/3` for Robot Movement (Hash: 87A71821):**  
  - Correctly handles `goto` actions, including success, failure, and no-action scenarios.  
- **`at/3` for Key Position (Hash: 75160384):**  
  - Accurately models the key's position based on whether the robot is carrying it.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) terminate correctly.  
  - Negation-as-failure (`\+`) is used appropriately to model conditions like `drops(key, T)`.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Compliance with Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - Probabilities for `pickup_succeeds`, `drop_slippery_key`, etc., adhere to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - The model correctly computes joint probabilities for combined events (e.g., `carrying(key, s(s(s(0))))`).  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and the key's state transitions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities are computed accurately, and the model handles uncertainty as expected.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this code.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable for the given scenario.

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is sound, and the test results confirm its correctness. No improvements are necessary for the given scenario.
