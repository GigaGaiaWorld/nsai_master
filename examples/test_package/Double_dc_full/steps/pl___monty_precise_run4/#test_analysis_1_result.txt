### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities are correct:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any door (`1/3`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is `1/3`.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is `2/3`.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the problem's requirements:
- The host opens a door that is neither selected nor hides the prize.
- The host chooses randomly between two empty doors if applicable.
- The rules for `win_keep` and `win_switch` are correctly defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door` and `win_switch` are logically sound. For example:
  - `open_door(A)` correctly identifies the only empty door when one exists.
  - `win_switch` ensures the player switches to the remaining unopened door.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate terminates as the list is finite.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `prize/1` and `open_door/1` comply with the rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is implicitly handled by negation.
  - The host's choice is fair (`0.5` probability for each door when two are empty).
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+` (negation) is correct and aligns with probabilistic logic.

**DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The rules correctly model the problem.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities align with the Monty Hall problem's expected outcomes.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable here.
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures valid lists (`[1,2,3]`).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to the small problem size.

    select_door(Selected),
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    \+ prize(A),
    \+ select_door(A),
    \+ (member(B, [1,2,3]), B \= A, \+ prize(B), \+ select_door(B)).
