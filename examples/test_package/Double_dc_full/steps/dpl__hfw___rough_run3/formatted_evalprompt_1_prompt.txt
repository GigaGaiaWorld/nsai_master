</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, ...]`) into their evaluated numerical results. The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` to map images to numbers and operators, respectively. The `parse/2` predicate recursively evaluates the arithmetic operations while ensuring numerical precision with `almost_equal/2`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify potential failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The query evaluates the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7` correctly to `11.666666666666668`. The probability of this result is `1.0000`, indicating certainty.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The code correctly implements the `parse/2` predicate for arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and handles recursive evaluation. The `almost_equal/2` predicate ensures numerical precision, and the `detect_all/2` predicate successfully maps images to symbols.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The recursive `parse/2` predicates correctly evaluate arithmetic operations in left-to-right order (no operator precedence is enforced, which is acceptable for the given requirements).  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The base case `parse([N], R)` ensures termination when the list is reduced to a single number.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.  
  - **DeepProbLog Integration**: The code does not use neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/...`), so the report notes: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this context.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of images. Non-list inputs would fail.  
  - **Undefined Operations**: The code does not handle unsupported operators (e.g., `^`).  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very long lists due to recursive evaluation.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling     | Code fails                      | Add input validation.               |
| 2      | Unsupported operators      | Code fails                      | Extend `detect_operator/2`.         |
| 3      | Deep recursion performance | Potential slowdown for long lists | Optimize with tail recursion.       |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The code meets the specified requirements and passes all tests. However, edge cases and potential improvements are noted for future enhancements.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
