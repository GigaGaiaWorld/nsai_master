### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, ...]`) into their evaluated numerical results. The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2` and `detect_operator/2` to map images to numbers and operators, respectively. The `parse/2` predicate recursively evaluates the arithmetic operations while ensuring numerical precision with `almost_equal/2`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify potential failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The query evaluates the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7` correctly to `11.666666666666668`. The probability of this result is `1.0000`, indicating certainty.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The code correctly implements the `parse/2` predicate for arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and handles recursive evaluation. The `almost_equal/2` predicate ensures numerical precision, and the `detect_all/2` predicate successfully maps images to symbols.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The recursive `parse/2` predicates correctly evaluate arithmetic operations in left-to-right order (no operator precedence is enforced, which is acceptable for the given requirements).  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The base case `parse([N], R)` ensures termination when the list is reduced to a single number.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.  
  - **DeepProbLog Integration**: The code does not use neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/...`), so the report notes: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this context.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of images. Non-list inputs would fail.  
  - **Undefined Operations**: The code does not handle unsupported operators (e.g., `^`).  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance may degrade for very long lists due to recursive evaluation.
