### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a classical rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze test results and identify failures.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and logical rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided was:
```problog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```
**Interpretation:** The error indicates that the ProbLog engine could not find a valid clause for the `->` operator at line 41, column 77. This suggests a syntax or logical error in the `determine_winner` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location:** Line 41, column 77 in the `determine_winner` predicate.
- **Problematic Code Block:**
  ```problog
  determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
      play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
      compute_score(Results, Score), 
      (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
  ```
- **Issue:** The `->` operator is not correctly formatted or supported in the ProbLog context. ProbLog does not natively support the `->` operator for conditional branching in this manner.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic for determining the winner is sound (compare scores and assign the winner based on the score). However, the implementation uses Prolog-style conditional branching (`->`), which is not valid in ProbLog.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly defined and terminate properly.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the implementation fails due to syntax issues.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., if `P1Moves` or `P2Moves` is not a list).
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Invalid `->` operator in ProbLog | Predicate fails to execute      | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible branching (e.g., `if_then_else/3`).  |
| 2   | No input validation              | May crash on invalid inputs     | Add checks for list inputs in `determine_winner`.                          |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace the `determine_winner` predicate with the following ProbLog-compatible version:
```problog
determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :- 
    play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results), 
    compute_score(Results, Score), 
    (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1'; 
     Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2'; 
     Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The implementation has logical correctness but fails due to syntax incompatibility with ProbLog. The suggested fix resolves the issue. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
