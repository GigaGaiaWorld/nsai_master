### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, where the Japanese person owns the zebra and the Norwegian drinks water.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification:**  
  - The predicates `my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3` are correctly defined and function as intended.  
  - No additional expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this implementation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to the logical constraints of the Zebra Puzzle. Each clue is correctly translated into a Prolog predicate, and the recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate properly.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Terminates when the element is found or the list is exhausted.  
  - `right_of/3`: Terminates when the right-of relationship is verified or the list is exhausted.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules. All constraints are deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic Prolog predicates.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are called.  
- **Non-List Input:** The predicates assume list inputs, but no checks are performed. This could lead to runtime errors if non-list inputs are provided.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to the length of the list (5 houses), so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and adheres to the logical constraints of the puzzle. The predicates are well-defined, and the solution matches the expected output. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, and the code is free of edge-case vulnerabilities for the given problem scope.
