### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of `digit/2` facts representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0 to 9). It also includes an `addition/3` rule to perform addition on these digits. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z))`.  
- **Result**:  
  - `addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000`.  

**Verification**:  
- The query correctly returns the sum of the digits corresponding to `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6), which is 11. The probability of this result is 1.0000, indicating certainty.  
- **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures** were detected in the provided code.  
- **Expansion Predicates**: The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so no verification is required for these.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
- **Logical Correctness**: The `addition/3` rule is logically correct. It retrieves the digits associated with the input images and computes their sum.  
- **Recursive Termination**: The code does not involve recursion, so termination is not a concern.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::digit(...)`), so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable.  

**DeepProbLog Integration**:  
- The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements**:  
1. **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The `addition/3` rule performs classical arithmetic reasoning.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

**Edge Cases**:  
- **Undefined Inputs**: The code does not handle cases where `digit/2` facts are missing for an image. For example, if `digit(img_10,10)` is queried, it would fail silently.  
- **Non-List Input**: Not applicable here, as the code does not process lists.  
- **Performance**: The code is simple and does not involve recursion or complex computations, so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No handling of missing `digit/2` facts | Potential silent failures | Add validation or default behavior for missing facts. |
| 2      | No probabilistic reasoning | Limited functionality | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural network support | Consider adding `nn/3` calls for advanced use cases. |
