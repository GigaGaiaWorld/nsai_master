</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game in ProbLog. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, including the rules of the game, the calculation of results, and the determination of the winner based on the players' moves. The evaluation focuses on logical correctness, recursive termination, and adherence to ProbLog syntax.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided was:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```

**Result:**
The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    toks = self.label_tokens(string, root_tokens)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/parser.py", line 1206, in label_tokens
    raise ParseError(string, "Ambiguous token role", t.location)
problog.parser.ParseError: Ambiguous token role at 39:42.
```

**Interpretation:**
The error indicates a syntax issue in the ProbLog code, specifically an ambiguous token role. This suggests that the parser encountered an unexpected or malformed token in the code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`
- **Error Location:** The error occurs during parsing, likely due to an incomplete or malformed predicate definition for `determine_winner/3`.
- **Code Issue:** The predicate `determine_winner/3` is not fully defined in the provided code. The code block ends abruptly without completing the predicate's logic.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `result/3` are logically correct and cover all possible outcomes of the game (win, lose, draw). The recursive predicate `play/3` is also correctly defined to process lists of moves.
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case for `play/3` (`play([], [], []).`) ensures termination when the input lists are empty.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The rules for the game are correctly implemented, but the `determine_winner/3` predicate is incomplete, preventing the code from functioning as intended.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs or undefined predicates (e.g., `expand/2`).
  - The recursive performance is efficient for small lists but could be problematic for very large lists due to stack usage.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incomplete `determine_winner/3` | Code cannot determine the winner | Complete the predicate to compute the winner based on the `play/3` results. |
| 2   | Syntax error (ambiguous token) | Code fails to parse             | Ensure all predicates are properly defined and terminated. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The code correctly implements the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors but fails due to an incomplete predicate (`determine_winner/3`) and a syntax error. Fixing these issues will allow the code to function as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation. 

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
