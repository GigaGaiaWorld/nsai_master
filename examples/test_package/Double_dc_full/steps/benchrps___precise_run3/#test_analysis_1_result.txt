### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Result**: The test failed with an error indicating that no clauses were found for `->/2` at line 41:77.
- **Expected Result**: The query should return `Winner = 'Player 2'` because:
  - `rock` vs `paper`: `lose` (Player 2 wins).
  - `rock` vs `paper`: `lose` (Player 2 wins).
  - `rock` vs `scissor`: `win` (Player 1 wins).
  - Final score: `-1` (Player 2 wins).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location**: Line 41, where the `->/2` operator is used in the `determine_winner` predicate.
- **Root Cause**: The error suggests that the `->/2` operator is not recognized or improperly used in the context of ProbLog. This is likely due to a syntax issue or missing parentheses.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The `result/3` and `beats/2` predicates are correctly defined.
  - The `play/3` predicate recursively processes the moves and results.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly updates the score based on wins, losses, and draws.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`). Thus, the report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."
- **Syntax Issue**:
  - The `->/2` operator in the `determine_winner` predicate is not properly formatted. The correct syntax should be:
    ```prolog
    determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
        play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
        compute_score(Results, Score),
        (Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'; Score < 0 -> Winner = 'Player 2'; Winner = 'Draw').
    ```

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: The code meets the requirements for classical reasoning, correctly implementing the game rules and recursive processing of moves.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Undefined behavior for invalid inputs.
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the move lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.
  - **Empty Lists**: The `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates handle empty lists correctly.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Syntax error with `->/2` operator | Prevents correct winner determination | Fix the syntax of the `determine_winner` predicate as shown in the analysis. |
| 2      | No probabilistic features used   | Limited to classical reasoning  | Extend the model with probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features if needed. |

---

#### **8. Final Recommendations**
1. **Fix Syntax**: Correct the `determine_winner` predicate to use the `->/2` operator properly.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Add validation for input moves to ensure they are valid (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
3. **Probabilistic Extension**: If probabilistic reasoning is desired, introduce probabilistic facts (e.g., biased moves) or DeepProbLog features.

**Word Count**: ~450 words.
