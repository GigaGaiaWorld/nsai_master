</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch doors. This evaluation assesses the correctness of the ProbLog implementation of this problem, focusing on:
- The probabilistic distribution of the prize.
- The logic for opening a door by the host.
- The outcomes of keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.0000`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is correctly set to `1.0000`.
- `win_keep` is correct (probability of winning by keeping the initial choice).
- **Failure:** `win_switch` is incorrect. The expected probability should be `0.6667` (the complement of `win_keep`).

**Conclusion:**  
The test for `win_switch` fails. All other tests pass.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:** `win_switch = 0.0000` (Expected: `0.6667`)

**Error Location:**
- The issue lies in the definition of `win_switch`. The current implementation does not account for the host's action of opening a door, which affects the probability of winning when switching.

**Code Block:**
```problog
win_switch :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    \+ select_door(A),
    prize(A),
    \+ open_door(A).
```

**Problem:**  
The predicate `win_switch` incorrectly assumes that the host does not open any door (`\+ open_door(A)`). This contradicts the problem's logic, where the host always opens a door without the prize.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Logical Correctness:**
- The `open_door/1` clauses are correctly defined:
  1. Randomly opens one of two eligible doors (uniform probability).
  2. Opens the only eligible door if only one exists.
- The error arises in `win_switch` due to the incorrect negation of `open_door(A)`.

**Probabilistic Rules:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` and `select_door/1` comply with probabilistic rules.
- The negation in `win_switch` (`\+ open_door(A)`) is misapplied, leading to a zero probability.

**DeepProbLog:**  
Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic for `open_door/1` is correct, but `win_switch` is flawed.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for `prize/1` and `select_door/1`.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- The current implementation does not handle cases where the host's action is not explicitly modeled in `win_switch`.
- The input for `member/2` is always a list, so non-list inputs are not a concern here.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `win_switch` incorrectly negates `open_door(A)` | Incorrect probability for switching doors | Redefine `win_switch` to account for the host's action. Example: `win_switch :- member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), prize(A), open_door(B), B \= A.` |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

--- 

**Final Note:**  
The implementation is mostly correct but requires a fix for `win_switch` to align with the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic outcomes. The suggested change will ensure the correct probability of winning when switching doors.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
