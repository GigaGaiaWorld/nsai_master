### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The problem demonstrates counterintuitive probabilistic reasoning.

This report evaluates the provided ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of the `open_door/1` predicate.
- Logical and probabilistic soundness.
- Handling of edge cases and errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error for the `->/2` operator at line 6:184. This suggests the ProbLog engine could not resolve the conditional logic in the `open_door/1` predicate.

**Failed Queries:**
- `open_door(D)` (due to the `UnknownClause` error).
- `win_switch` (depends on `open_door/1`).

**Passed Queries:**
- `prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, and `win_keep` (these do not depend on the faulty `open_door/1` predicate).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location:** Line 6:184 in the `open_door/1` predicate.
- **Problem:** The conditional logic (`->/2`) is not correctly implemented or supported in the ProbLog context.
- **Impact:** The `open_door/1` predicate fails to execute, causing dependent queries (`win_switch`) to fail.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The `open_door/1` predicate attempts to use Prolog-style conditional logic (`->/2`), which is not fully supported in ProbLog. ProbLog lacks built-in support for dynamic conditionals in probabilistic rules.
   - The predicate also incorrectly mixes deterministic and probabilistic logic without proper separation.

2. **Probabilistic Rules:**
   - The predicate does not adhere to ProbLog's probabilistic semantics. For example, the uniform distribution between doors A and B is not correctly modeled.
   - The negation (`\+`) and implication logic are not aligned with ProbLog's probabilistic negation rules (`P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`).

3. **DeepProbLog:**
   - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (basic predicates like `prize/1` and `select_door/1` work).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (due to the `open_door/1` failure).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates are not handled.
  - Recursive performance is not an issue here, but the dynamic conditional logic is problematic.

| 2   | Incorrect probabilistic logic    | Uniform distribution not modeled| Use `prob::uniform/2` or similar to model randomness between doors.       |
| 3   | Negation misuse                  | Probabilistic negation invalid  | Use `1 - P(A)` for probabilistic negation instead of `\+`.                |

### **Conclusion**
The implementation fails due to the misuse of Prolog-style conditionals in ProbLog and incorrect probabilistic modeling. To fix this:
1. Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible constructs.
2. Use explicit probabilistic rules for uniform distribution.
3. Ensure negation aligns with ProbLog's semantics.
