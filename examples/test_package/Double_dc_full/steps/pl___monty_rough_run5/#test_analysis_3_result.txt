### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle, in ProbLog. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the `open_door/1` predicate, which simulates Monty's action of opening a door based on the player's choice and the prize location. The evaluation includes testing, failure localization, root cause analysis, and overall compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error for the `->/2` operator. The error occurs because the `->/2` operator is not correctly interpreted in the ProbLog context. The specific error message is:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:126.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The `open_door/1` predicate fails to execute due to the unsupported `->/2` operator.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `open_door/1` (lines 6â€“7).
- **Error Location:** The `->/2` operator in the conditional statement is not recognized in ProbLog.
- **Impact:** The predicate cannot determine which door Monty should open, leading to a failure in the entire model.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the `open_door/1` predicate is correct in Prolog but not in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined, but the conditional logic in `open_door/1` violates ProbLog's syntax rules.
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Unsupported Operator:** ProbLog does not support the `->/2` operator for conditional branching.
2. **Alternative Approach:** Use `if-then-else` constructs or auxiliary predicates to handle conditions.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (fails due to unsupported operator).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for `prize/1` and `select_door/1`.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where the input is not a valid door number (e.g., non-integer or out-of-range values).
  - Recursive performance is not an issue here, but the unsupported operator is a critical oversight.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Unsupported `->/2` operator      | `open_door/1` fails to execute  | Replace with `if-then-else` or auxiliary predicates. |
| 2      | Undefined edge cases for input   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for `open_door/1`.    |

---

### **Recommendations**
1. Replace the `->/2` operator with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., using auxiliary predicates).
2. Validate inputs to `open_door/1` to handle edge cases.
3. Test the revised implementation to ensure all queries (`win_keep`, `win_switch`) return correct probabilities.
