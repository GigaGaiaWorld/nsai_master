<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The problem demonstrates counterintuitive probabilistic reasoning.

This report evaluates the provided ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of the `open_door/1` predicate.
- Logical and probabilistic soundness.
- Handling of edge cases and errors.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error for the `->/2` operator at line 6:184. This suggests the ProbLog engine could not resolve the conditional logic in the `open_door/1` predicate.

**Failed Queries:**
- `open_door(D)` (due to the `UnknownClause` error).
- `win_switch` (depends on `open_door/1`).

**Passed Queries:**
- `prize(_)`, `select_door(_)`, and `win_keep` (these do not depend on the faulty `open_door/1` predicate).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location:** Line 6:184 in the `open_door/1` predicate.
- **Problem:** The conditional logic (`->/2`) is not correctly implemented or supported in the ProbLog context.
- **Impact:** The `open_door/1` predicate fails to execute, causing dependent queries (`win_switch`) to fail.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The `open_door/1` predicate attempts to use Prolog-style conditional logic (`->/2`), which is not fully supported in ProbLog. ProbLog lacks built-in support for dynamic conditionals in probabilistic rules.
   - The predicate also incorrectly mixes deterministic and probabilistic logic without proper separation.

2. **Probabilistic Rules:**
   - The predicate does not adhere to ProbLog's probabilistic semantics. For example, the uniform distribution between doors A and B is not correctly modeled.
   - The negation (`\+`) and implication logic are not aligned with ProbLog's probabilistic negation rules (`P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`).

3. **DeepProbLog:**
   - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (basic predicates like `prize/1` and `select_door/1` work).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (due to the `open_door/1` failure).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs or undefined predicates are not handled.
  - Recursive performance is not an issue here, but the dynamic conditional logic is problematic.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` for `->/2`       | `open_door/1` fails             | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible probabilistic rules.               |
| 2   | Incorrect probabilistic logic    | Uniform distribution not modeled| Use `prob::uniform/2` or similar to model randomness between doors.       |
| 3   | Negation misuse                  | Probabilistic negation invalid  | Use `1 - P(A)` for probabilistic negation instead of `\+`.                |

---

### **Conclusion**
The implementation fails due to the misuse of Prolog-style conditionals in ProbLog and incorrect probabilistic modeling. To fix this:
1. Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible constructs.
2. Use explicit probabilistic rules for uniform distribution.
3. Ensure negation aligns with ProbLog's semantics.

**Word Count:** 450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
