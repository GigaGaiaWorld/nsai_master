  "ErrorSummary": "The predicate `win_switch` incorrectly assumes the host does not open any door (`\+ open_door(A)`), leading to a zero probability for switching doors. The expected probability should be 0.6667.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Redefine `win_switch` to account for the host's action. Example: `win_switch :- member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), prize(A), open_door(B), B \\= A.`",
