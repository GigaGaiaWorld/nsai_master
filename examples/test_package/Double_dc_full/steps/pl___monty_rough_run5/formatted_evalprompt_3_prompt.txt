</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle, in ProbLog. The goal is to verify the correctness of the implementation, focusing on the `open_door/1` predicate, which simulates Monty's action of opening a door based on the player's choice and the prize location. The evaluation includes testing, failure localization, root cause analysis, and overall compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to an `UnknownClause` error for the `->/2` operator. The error occurs because the `->/2` operator is not correctly interpreted in the ProbLog context. The specific error message is:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 6:126.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The `open_door/1` predicate fails to execute due to the unsupported `->/2` operator.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `open_door/1` (lines 6–7).
- **Error Location:** The `->/2` operator in the conditional statement is not recognized in ProbLog.
- **Impact:** The predicate cannot determine which door Monty should open, leading to a failure in the entire model.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the `open_door/1` predicate is correct in Prolog but not in ProbLog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined, but the conditional logic in `open_door/1` violates ProbLog's syntax rules.
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Unsupported Operator:** ProbLog does not support the `->/2` operator for conditional branching.
2. **Alternative Approach:** Use `if-then-else` constructs or auxiliary predicates to handle conditions.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (fails due to unsupported operator).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for `prize/1` and `select_door/1`.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `open_door/1` predicate does not handle cases where the input is not a valid door number (e.g., non-integer or out-of-range values).
  - Recursive performance is not an issue here, but the unsupported operator is a critical oversight.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Unsupported `->/2` operator      | `open_door/1` fails to execute  | Replace with `if-then-else` or auxiliary predicates. |
| 2      | Undefined edge cases for input   | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for `open_door/1`.    |

---

### **Recommendations**
1. Replace the `->/2` operator with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., using auxiliary predicates).
2. Validate inputs to `open_door/1` to handle edge cases.
3. Test the revised implementation to ensure all queries (`win_keep`, `win_switch`) return correct probabilities.

**Word Count:** 450 words.

This report provides a clear analysis of the issues and actionable suggestions for improvement. Let me know if you'd like further details or assistance with the corrections!

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
