### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch doors. This evaluation assesses the correctness of the ProbLog implementation of this problem, focusing on:
- The probabilistic distribution of the prize.
- The logic for opening a door by the host.
- The outcomes of keeping or switching the initial choice.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.0000`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is correctly set to `1.0000`.
- `win_keep` is correct (probability of winning by keeping the initial choice).
- **Failure:** `win_switch` is incorrect. The expected probability should be `0.6667` (the complement of `win_keep`).

**Conclusion:**  
The test for `win_switch` fails. All other tests pass.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:** `win_switch = 0.0000` (Expected: `0.6667`)

**Error Location:**
- The issue lies in the definition of `win_switch`. The current implementation does not account for the host's action of opening a door, which affects the probability of winning when switching.

**Code Block:**
```problog
win_switch :-
    member(A, [1,2,3]),
    \+ select_door(A),
    prize(A),
    \+ open_door(A).
```

**Problem:**  
The predicate `win_switch` incorrectly assumes that the host does not open any door (`\+ open_door(A)`). This contradicts the problem's logic, where the host always opens a door without the prize.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Logical Correctness:**
- The `open_door/1` clauses are correctly defined:
  1. Randomly opens one of two eligible doors (uniform probability).
  2. Opens the only eligible door if only one exists.
- The error arises in `win_switch` due to the incorrect negation of `open_door(A)`.

**Probabilistic Rules:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` and `select_door/1` comply with probabilistic rules.
- The negation in `win_switch` (`\+ open_door(A)`) is misapplied, leading to a zero probability.

**DeepProbLog:**  
Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic for `open_door/1` is correct, but `win_switch` is flawed.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Correctly implemented for `prize/1` and `select_door/1`.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- The current implementation does not handle cases where the host's action is not explicitly modeled in `win_switch`.
- The input for `member/2` is always a list, so non-list inputs are not a concern here.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `win_switch` incorrectly negates `open_door(A)` | Incorrect probability for switching doors | Redefine `win_switch` to account for the host's action. Example: `win_switch :- member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ select_door(A), prize(A), open_door(B), B \= A.` |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

--- 

**Final Note:**  
The implementation is mostly correct but requires a fix for `win_switch` to align with the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic outcomes. The suggested change will ensure the correct probability of winning when switching doors.
