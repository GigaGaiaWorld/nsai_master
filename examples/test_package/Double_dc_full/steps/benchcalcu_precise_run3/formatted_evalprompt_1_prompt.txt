<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the sum of two numbers (`AB` and `BCD`) equals a third number (`CDE`). The puzzle enforces constraints such as unique digits for each letter and no leading zeros. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`, all with a probability of `1.0000`.  

**Key Observations:**  
- All tests passed (no failures).  
- Each solution adheres to the constraints:  
  - No leading zeros (`leftdigit/1`).  
  - All digits are unique (`all_different/1`).  
  - The arithmetic (`sumdigit/5`) correctly handles carries.  

**Example Solutions:**  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9])` corresponds to `47 + 782 = 829`.  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9])` corresponds to `85 + 564 = 649`.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- All predicates (`digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and executed.  
- The recursive predicate `all_different/1` terminates correctly for lists of length 5 (as required by the puzzle).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The constraints (`leftdigit`, `all_different`) are correctly enforced.  
  - The `sumdigit/5` predicate accurately simulates column-wise addition with carry propagation.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - `all_different/1` terminates because the list length is fixed (5 elements), and `member/2` is bounded.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The puzzle does not involve probabilistic facts or negations.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - Not used in this implementation (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Constraints and arithmetic are correctly implemented.                       |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid input lists of length 5. Non-list inputs or incorrect lengths would fail.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is minimal (fixed list length), so performance is not a concern.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No failures or edge-case issues were identified. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation or extending the puzzle to include probabilistic constraints.  

**Word Count:** 450

**Code Block for Reference:**  
```prolog
query_sum([A,B,C,D,E]) :-
    leftdigit(A), leftdigit(B), leftdigit(C),
    digit(D), digit(E),
    all_different([A,B,C,D,E]),
    sumdigit(0, B, D, E, Carry1),
    sumdigit(Carry1, A, C, D, Carry2),
    sumdigit(Carry2, B, 0, C, _).
```  

**Table of Solutions:**  
| A | B | C | D | E | Equation      |
|---|---|---|---|---|---------------|
| 4 | 7 | 8 | 2 | 9 | 47 + 782 = 829 |
| 8 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 9 | 85 + 564 = 649 |

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
