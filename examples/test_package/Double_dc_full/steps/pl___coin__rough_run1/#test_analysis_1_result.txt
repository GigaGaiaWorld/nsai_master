### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads after all tosses. The code includes a recursive predicate `coins_r/3` and a query `total(_)` to test the functionality. The evaluation focuses on verifying logical correctness, probabilistic compliance, and edge-case handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a **non-ground probabilistic clause** error. The error occurs at line 1:5, where the probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not properly grounded. No successful queries were executed due to this error.

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Error:** `NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.`  
  - **Expected:** Successful execution with probabilistic results for `total(S)`.  
  - **Actual:** Execution halted due to the error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `coin(C)`  
  - **Location:** Line 1 (`coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`)  
  - **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `coin(C)` is not grounded, violating ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic clauses must be ground (i.e., no unbound variables).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically sound for counting heads, but the non-ground `coin(C)` prevents execution.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly when `CNT` reaches 0.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The error arises because `coin(C)` is not grounded. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be fully instantiated (e.g., `coin(1)::0.8`).  
- **Negations/Implications:** Not applicable here, as the code does not use negations or implications.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but execution fails due to grounding issues).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (non-ground probabilistic clause).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-Ground Probabilistic Facts:** Overlooked in the initial implementation.  
- **Deep Recursion:** Not an issue here due to small `CNT` (4).

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground probabilistic clause | Execution halted               | Replace `coin(C)` with grounded facts (e.g., `coin(1)::0.8; coin(0)::0.2`). |
| 2   | No DeepProbLog features         | N/A                            | Not applicable for this code.                                              |

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Notes:**  
The code's logical structure is sound, but the non-ground probabilistic clause prevents execution. Fixing the grounding issue will resolve the error. No DeepProbLog features are used, and edge cases like deep recursion are not problematic here.  

**Suggested Fix:**  
```prolog
coin(1)::0.8.  % Grounded probabilistic fact
coin(0)::0.2.  % Grounded probabilistic fact
```  

This ensures compliance with ProbLog's requirements and enables successful execution.
