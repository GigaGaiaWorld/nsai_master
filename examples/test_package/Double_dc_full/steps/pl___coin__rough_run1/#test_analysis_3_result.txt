### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulating the number of heads (`SC`). The final result (`S`) should represent the total number of heads after `CNT` tosses. The code includes a recursive predicate `coins_r/3` and a query `total(S)` to test the functionality. However, the test results indicate an error related to non-ground probabilistic clauses.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(_)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = self.handle_nonground(
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
  problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```  
- **Conclusion:** The test failed due to a non-ground probabilistic clause.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(_)`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate/Rule:** `PH::make_coin(C,PH)`  
  - **Line Number:** 1  
- **Issue:** The probabilistic fact `PH::make_coin(C,PH)` is non-ground because `C` is uninstantiated. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be ground (i.e., all variables must be instantiated).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical reasoning, but the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,0.8)` is not properly grounded.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the decrementing counter `CNT`.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The error arises because the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,0.8)` is non-ground. ProbLog requires all probabilistic facts to be ground at runtime.  
  - The negation/implication rules are not applicable here, as the issue is syntactic.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but grounding issue exists).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (non-ground probabilistic fact).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle cases where `CNT` is negative or non-integer.  
  - The probabilistic fact must be grounded to avoid runtime errors.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground probabilistic clause | Code fails to execute           | Instantiate `C` in `make_coin(C,0.8)` (e.g., `make_coin(coin1,0.8)`). |
| 2   | Undefined edge cases for `CNT`   | Potential runtime errors        | Add guards for `CNT` (e.g., `CNT >= 0`). |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Notes:**  
The code requires grounding of the probabilistic fact and additional edge-case handling to meet the functional requirements. The recursive logic is sound, but the probabilistic aspect must be corrected for successful execution.
