### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Population Density Query in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The code calculates the density for each country and compares them using specific thresholds. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results returned the following queries with their probabilities:  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the code, as the calculated densities and comparisons satisfy the conditions specified in the `query_pop` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- The `density/2` predicate correctly computes the population density for each country.  
- The `query_pop/1` predicate accurately identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal densities based on the given thresholds (`T1` and `T2`).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the `query_pop` predicate is sound. It ensures that `D1 > D2` and that the densities are within a 5% margin (`T1 < T2`).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The code does not involve recursion, so termination is not a concern.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It operates purely in a deterministic context.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the logic to compare population densities.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as the code is deterministic.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.  
- **Non-list Input:** The input to `query_pop` is expected to be a list, but the code does not explicitly handle invalid inputs. This could be improved.  
- **Performance:** The code is efficient for the given dataset, but scalability might be an issue for larger datasets due to the quadratic complexity of comparing all pairs of countries.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No input validation for `query_pop` | Potential runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add checks for list structure and valid country names. |
| 2      | Scalability for large datasets | Performance degradation | Optimize the comparison logic or use indexing. |
| 3      | DeepProbLog not utilized | Limited to deterministic reasoning | Consider extending for probabilistic or neural network integration if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code meets its functional requirements and passes all tests. Minor improvements could enhance robustness and scalability.
