### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, where the Japanese person owns the zebra and the Norwegian drinks water.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly checks adjacency using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly checks if one element is immediately to the right of another in a list.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The constraints in the `zebra/1` predicate are logically sound and correctly encode the puzzle's rules.  
  - Recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly for finite lists.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code assumes valid input (a list of 5 houses). Non-list input or lists of incorrect length would cause errors.  
  - No undefined predicates or expansion rules (`expand/2`, `implies/2`, etc.) are used.  

##### **Probabilistic Analysis**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:**  
  - The puzzle is deterministic, so no probabilistic facts or negations are involved.  
  - The result probability of `1.0000` confirms the solution is certain.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved correctly using deterministic logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Input Validation:** The code does not validate the input list's length or structure.  
- **Performance:** Recursive predicates are efficient for small lists but may face performance issues with very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No input validation | May fail for invalid inputs | Add checks for list length and structure. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used | Limited to classical reasoning | Consider extending for probabilistic or neural tasks if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to ProbLog's classical reasoning capabilities. For future enhancements, consider adding input validation and exploring probabilistic or neural extensions if the problem domain expands.
