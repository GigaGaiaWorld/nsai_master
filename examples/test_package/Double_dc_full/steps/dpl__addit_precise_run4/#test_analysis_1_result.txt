### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Number Conversion**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to:  
1. Convert a list of images (e.g., `[img_7, img_9]`) into a corresponding number (e.g., `79`).  
2. Perform multi-digit addition by parsing two lists of images into numbers and summing them.  
The evaluation verifies the correctness of the implementation, including recursive logic, termination, and adherence to requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query Tested:**  
```prolog
query(multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], Z)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
multi_addition([img_7, img_9], [img_3, img_1, img_2], 391) = 1.0000
```
**Verification:**  
- Expected: `79 + 312 = 391`  
- Actual: Matches the expected result.  
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `number/3` and `multi_addition/3` are correctly implemented.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `number/3` predicate recursively processes the list of images, converting each to a digit and accumulating the result. The base case (`number([], Result, Result)`) ensures termination.  
  - The `multi_addition/3` predicate correctly parses both input lists and sums the resulting numbers.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion in `number/3` terminates when the input list is empty, as required.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`), so no probabilistic analysis is needed.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The code does not use neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:**  
   - Met. The code correctly converts image lists to numbers and performs addition.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
   - Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration:**  
   - Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input is a list of valid images (e.g., `img_1`). Non-list inputs or invalid images would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance is linear with the length of the input list, which is efficient for typical use cases.

| Number | Problem               | Impact | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | None                  | None   | Ensure input validation for edge cases. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used  | None   | Consider extending for probabilistic tasks. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning and performs as expected. No failures were detected, and the implementation is logically sound. Future work could include input validation and probabilistic extensions.
