### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a basic meta-interpreter for ProbLog, along with extended logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the meta-interpreter and extended predicates.  
- Analyze the test results for logical and probabilistic consistency.  
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.  
- Identify edge cases and potential improvements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:  
- `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob))) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice))) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(expand(double(3),6)) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(includes([a, b, c],b)) = 0.0000`  
- `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2])) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (returned `0.0000`), indicating incorrect implementations or missing definitions for the extended predicates.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The following predicates are missing or incorrectly implemented:  
1. **`implies/2`**: Defined but not integrated into the meta-interpreter.  
2. **`opposite/1`**: Missing definition.  
3. **`expand/2`**: Defined for `double/1` and `square/1` but not linked to the meta-interpreter.  
4. **`includes/2`**: Missing definition.  
5. **`extend/3`**: Missing definition.  
6. **`refute/1`**: Missing definition.  

**Code Line Numbers:**  
- The `implies/2` definition is provided but not used in the meta-interpreter.  
- Other predicates are entirely missing.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The meta-interpreter (`prove/1`) does not handle the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.).  
- Recursive termination is correct for `member/2` and `prove/1` but not tested for the missing predicates.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The test results (`0.0000`) suggest that the meta-interpreter does not compute probabilities for the extended predicates.  
- Probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are not applied due to missing implementations.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (basic meta-interpreter works, but extended predicates are missing).  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (probabilities are not computed for extended predicates).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Undefined `expand/2` for non-numeric inputs.  
- Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` would fail.  
- Deep recursion performance is untested.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing `opposite/1` definition  | Cannot compute negations        | Define `opposite(Goal) :- \+ Goal.`                                        |
| 2   | Missing `includes/2` definition  | Cannot check list membership    | Define `includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).`                       |
| 3   | Missing `extend/3` definition    | Cannot prepend to lists         | Define `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).`                                 |
| 4   | Missing `refute/1` definition    | Cannot disprove goals           | Define `refute(Goal) :- \+ prove(Goal).`                                   |
| 5   | `implies/2` not integrated       | Implications not processed      | Add `prove(implies(A, B)) :- (\+ A; B).` to the meta-interpreter.         |
| 6   | `expand/2` not linked            | Expansion rules not applied     | Add `prove(expand(Goal, Result)) :- expand(Goal, Result).` to meta-interpreter. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.

**Final Note:** The meta-interpreter requires significant updates to support the extended predicates and probabilistic reasoning. Edge cases and performance should be tested after implementation.
