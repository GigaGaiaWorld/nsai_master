### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic rock-paper-scissors game, including the rules for determining the outcome of moves and calculating the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. The moves `[rock, rock, rock]` vs. `[paper, paper, scissor]` yield a score of `-1` (player2 wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `move/1`, `beats/2`, `outcome/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3` are correctly defined and function as intended.  
  - No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this implementation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The logical correctness of the rules is confirmed. For example, `beats(rock, scissor)` correctly defines the winning condition.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` by base cases (`play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`).  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation. The code operates purely in a deterministic context.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The rules and predicates correctly implement the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes lists as input for `play/3` and `compute_score/2`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for small lists but may degrade for very large lists due to recursive calls.  
  - **Undefined Moves**: The code does not handle moves outside `rock`, `paper`, or `scissor`.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error              | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Undefined moves          | Incorrect results          | Extend `move/1` to reject invalid moves. |
| 3      | Deep recursion           | Performance issues         | Consider iterative solutions for large inputs. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The implementation is logically correct and meets the requirements for classical reasoning. Edge cases and input validation could be improved for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
