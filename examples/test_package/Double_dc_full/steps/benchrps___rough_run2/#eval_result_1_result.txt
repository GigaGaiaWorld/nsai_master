{"HASH": "CFA63C1E", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. Edge cases (non-list inputs, undefined moves) are not handled but are not part of the original requirements.", "SuggestedFix": "None needed for current requirements. For robustness, consider adding input validation (e.g., `valid_moves/1`) and handling non-list inputs.", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
