### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of `digit/2` facts representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0 to 9). It also includes an `addition/3` rule to perform addition on these digits. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```problog
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
```
**Result:**  
```
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected output (`5 + 6 = 11`).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures** were detected in the provided code.  
- **Expansion Predicates:** The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so no verification is required for these.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The `digit/2` facts are correctly defined, and the `addition/3` rule logically combines these facts to perform addition.  
- The rule `addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A + B.` is logically sound and terminates correctly.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no probabilities are assigned to `digit/2` facts).  
- No negations or implications are present, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The `addition/3` rule correctly performs classical addition.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code does not handle cases where `digit/2` facts are missing (e.g., `digit(img_10,10)`).  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here, as inputs are atomic terms (`img_1`, `img_2`, etc.).  
- **Recursive Performance:** No recursion is used, so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No handling of undefined `digit/2` facts | Potential runtime errors | Add validation or default cases for missing facts. |
| 2      | No probabilistic reasoning | Limited functionality | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural network support | Incorporate `nn/3` or similar predicates for hybrid reasoning. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The code is functionally correct for classical reasoning but lacks probabilistic and DeepProbLog features. Edge cases like undefined inputs should be addressed for robustness.
