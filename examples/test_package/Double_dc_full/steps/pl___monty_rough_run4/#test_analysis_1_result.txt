**Analysis of the Monty Hall Problem Implementation in ProbLog**

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a player selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the player the choice to switch doors. The problem demonstrates that switching doors increases the probability of winning from 1/3 to 2/3.  

This report evaluates the correctness of the ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem, focusing on:  
- Logical correctness of the rules.  
- Probabilistic reasoning (e.g., uniform distribution for door selection).  
- Compliance with the problem's requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`  
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`  
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`  
- `win_keep = 0.3333`  
- `win_switch = 0.6667`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).  
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.  
- `win_keep` (probability of winning by keeping the initial choice) is 1/3, which is correct.  
- `win_switch` (probability of winning by switching) is 2/3, which is correct.  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Uniform Random Selection:** When two doors are available for Monty to open, the rule `open_door/1` ensures a uniform random choice (50% probability for each door).  
2. **Forced Selection:** When only one door is available (no prize and not selected by the player), Monty must open it.  

The predicates `member/2` and `findall/3` are correctly used to enforce these conditions.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` correctly handle the two scenarios (two doors or one door available). Recursion in `member/2` terminates as expected.  
- **Negation and Implication:** The use of `\+` (negation) is correct, e.g., `\+ prize(Door)` ensures the opened door does not contain the prize.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` and `open_door/1` comply with probabilistic rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled by the uniform distribution.  
  - The disjunction in `open_door/1` correctly models the 50% choice between two doors.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this implementation.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules correctly implement the Monty Hall logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with the problem's theoretical expectations.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `select_door/1` is always called with a valid door number).  
- **Performance:** Recursion in `member/2` is efficient for small lists (3 doors).
