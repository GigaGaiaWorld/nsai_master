### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic rock-paper-scissors game, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation through test results.
- Analyze logical and probabilistic correctness.
- Ensure edge cases and recursive termination are handled properly.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock],[paper, paper, scissor],player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs `paper`: Player 2 wins.
    - `rock` vs `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
  - The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `move/1`: Correctly defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).
  - `beats/2`: Correctly defines win-lose relationships.
  - `result/3`: Correctly computes `draw`, `win`, or `lose`.
  - `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Recursive logic and termination are correct.
  - `determine_winner/3`: Correctly computes the winner based on the score.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `result/3` and `beats/2` are logically sound.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`) ensure termination.
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The code is purely deterministic.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/â€¦` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The game logic is correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes valid input lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.
  - **Undefined Cases:** All gestures and results are explicitly defined.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation is correct and meets the requirements for a deterministic rock-paper-scissors game. No failures were detected in the provided test case. The code is concise, logically sound, and handles the basic game mechanics effectively. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic features or input validation for robustness.
