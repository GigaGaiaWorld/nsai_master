### **Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, including the rules for determining wins, losses, and draws. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because:  
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.  
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.  
  - `rock` vs. `scissor`: Player 1 wins.  
  The final score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).  

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. All predicates and rules are correctly defined and function as intended.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `beats/2` and `move/1` predicates correctly define the game rules.  
  - The `result/3` predicate accurately determines the outcome of each round.  
  - The recursive `play/3` and `compute_score/2` predicates correctly handle lists of moves and compute the final score.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination.  
  - The recursive case `play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs])` correctly processes each round.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`). Thus, no probabilistic analysis is required.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- The code does not use DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  **Report**: DeepProbLog feature not used.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Satisfied   | The code correctly implements the game logic and recursive reasoning.       |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Used  | No probabilistic facts or rules are included.                               |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are utilized.                                      |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes inputs are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Undefined Moves**: If an undefined move (e.g., `spock`) is provided, the code will fail.  
- **Performance**: Deep recursion with very long lists could impact performance, but this is unlikely in practice.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**: The implementation is logically correct and meets the classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks probabilistic or DeepProbLog features, which could be explored for more advanced use cases. Edge cases like invalid inputs should be handled for robustness.
