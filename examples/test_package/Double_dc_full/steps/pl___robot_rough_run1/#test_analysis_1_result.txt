### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like picking up the key, dropping it, and moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5898`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, where the robot successfully picks up the key and moves to `loc2` with a high probability, while the key's location is updated accordingly.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (e.g., `at(key,Pos,0)`).  
- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The negation `\+ drops(key, T)` adheres to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.  
  - The implications (e.g., `drops(key,T) :- slippery(key,T), drop_slippery_key(T)`) comply with probabilistic rules.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities for actions (e.g., `pickup_succeeds`, `goto_succeeds`) are correctly computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates were found.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not applicable, as the code does not handle lists.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is manageable (limited to `s(s(s(0)))` in the test case).
