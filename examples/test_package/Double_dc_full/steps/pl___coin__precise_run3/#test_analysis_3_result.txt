### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, where each coin has a probability of 0.8 to land heads. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) in `CNT` tosses and accumulate the result in `S`. The code is tested with `CNT = 4`, and the query `total(_)` is evaluated. The test result shows `total(X2) = 0.0000`, which is unexpected. This report analyzes the code's correctness, identifies failures, and provides suggestions for improvement.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(_)`  
  - **Result:** `total(X2) = 0.0000`  
  - **Expected Result:** A non-zero probability distribution over possible values of `S` (e.g., `S = 0`, `S = 1`, ..., `S = 4`).  

**Conclusion:** The test fails because the result does not match the expected probabilistic distribution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(_)`  
  - **Actual Result:** `0.0000`  
  - **Expected Result:** A distribution of probabilities for `S` (e.g., `P(S=0)`, `P(S=1)`, etc.).  

**Error Location:**  
- The issue lies in the recursive predicate `coins_r/3`. The base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)` is correct, but the recursive case does not properly account for the probabilistic nature of `coin(CNT)`.  
- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
      CNT > 0,
      coin(CNT),
      CNT1 is CNT - 1,
      coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1),
      SC = SC1 + 1.
  ```  
  The predicate `coin(CNT)` is not being used to conditionally increment `SC`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic does not correctly propagate the probabilistic outcomes of `coin(CNT)`. The predicate `coin(CNT)` is called, but its result (heads or tails) is not used to conditionally update `SC`.  
  - The base case is correct, but the recursive case lacks the probabilistic branching required for the problem.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The code does not comply with probabilistic rules like `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`. The predicate `coin(CNT)` is defined as `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`, but its outcome is not utilized in the recursive step.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The recursive structure is correct, but the probabilistic branching is missing.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The code does not compute the expected probabilistic distribution.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle edge cases like `CNT < 0` or non-integer inputs.  
  - The recursive performance is acceptable for small `CNT` but may suffer for large values due to lack of tail recursion optimization.

**Final Remarks:**  
The code requires significant revisions to meet the probabilistic requirements. The recursive logic must be updated to account for the probabilistic outcomes of `coin(CNT)`, and edge cases should be handled explicitly. Once corrected, the code should produce the expected probabilistic distribution for `total(_)`.
