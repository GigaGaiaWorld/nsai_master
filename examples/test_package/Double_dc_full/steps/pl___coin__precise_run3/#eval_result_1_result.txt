  "ErrorSummary": "Invalid argument types for call to 'is/2': arguments (X1, X2+1) are not ground, violating ProbLog's mode restrictions.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Reorder the clauses in the predicate to ensure SC1 is instantiated before the arithmetic operation. Modify the predicate as follows:\n\ncoins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-\n    CNT > 0,\n    coin(CNT),\n    CNT1 is CNT - 1,\n    coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1),\n    SC = SC1 + 1.\n\nAlternatively, use '= instead of 'is' for unification if SC1 is already bound.",
