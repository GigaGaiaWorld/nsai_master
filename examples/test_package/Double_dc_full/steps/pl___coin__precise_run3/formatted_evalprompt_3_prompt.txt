</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a series of coin tosses, where each coin has a probability of 0.8 to land heads. The goal is to count the number of successful heads (`SC`) in `CNT` tosses and accumulate the result in `S`. The code is tested with `CNT = 4`, and the query `total(_)` is evaluated. The test result shows `total(X2) = 0.0000`, which is unexpected. This report analyzes the code's correctness, identifies failures, and provides suggestions for improvement.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `total(_)`  
  - **Result:** `total(X2) = 0.0000`  
  - **Expected Result:** A non-zero probability distribution over possible values of `S` (e.g., `S = 0`, `S = 1`, ..., `S = 4`).  

**Conclusion:** The test fails because the result does not match the expected probabilistic distribution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `total(_)`  
  - **Actual Result:** `0.0000`  
  - **Expected Result:** A distribution of probabilities for `S` (e.g., `P(S=0)`, `P(S=1)`, etc.).  

**Error Location:**  
- The issue lies in the recursive predicate `coins_r/3`. The base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)` is correct, but the recursive case does not properly account for the probabilistic nature of `coin(CNT)`.  
- **Code Block:**  
  ```prolog
  coins_r(SC,S,CNT) :-
      CNT > 0,
      coin(CNT),
      CNT1 is CNT - 1,
      coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1),
      SC = SC1 + 1.
  ```  
  The predicate `coin(CNT)` is not being used to conditionally increment `SC`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive logic does not correctly propagate the probabilistic outcomes of `coin(CNT)`. The predicate `coin(CNT)` is called, but its result (heads or tails) is not used to conditionally update `SC`.  
  - The base case is correct, but the recursive case lacks the probabilistic branching required for the problem.  

- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The code does not comply with probabilistic rules like `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`. The predicate `coin(CNT)` is defined as `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`, but its outcome is not utilized in the recursive step.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The recursive structure is correct, but the probabilistic branching is missing.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met. The code does not compute the expected probabilistic distribution.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle edge cases like `CNT < 0` or non-integer inputs.  
  - The recursive performance is acceptable for small `CNT` but may suffer for large values due to lack of tail recursion optimization.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Recursive case ignores `coin(CNT)` | Incorrect probabilistic results | Modify the recursive case to conditionally update `SC` based on `coin(CNT)`. |
| 2      | No probabilistic distribution     | Results are invalid             | Ensure the code computes probabilities for all possible values of `S`.      |
| 3      | Edge cases unhandled              | Potential runtime errors        | Add guards for invalid inputs (e.g., `CNT < 0`).                           |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code requires significant revisions to meet the probabilistic requirements. The recursive logic must be updated to account for the probabilistic outcomes of `coin(CNT)`, and edge cases should be handled explicitly. Once corrected, the code should produce the expected probabilistic distribution for `total(_)`.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
