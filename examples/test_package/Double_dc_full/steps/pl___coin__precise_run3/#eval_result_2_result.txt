  "ErrorSummary": "CallModeError due to misuse of `is/2` predicate in recursive rule. `SC1` is not ground when `SC is SC1 + 1` is evaluated.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace `SC is SC1 + 1` with `SC = SC1 + 1` to use unification instead of arithmetic evaluation. Ensure `SC1` is ground before arithmetic operations.",
