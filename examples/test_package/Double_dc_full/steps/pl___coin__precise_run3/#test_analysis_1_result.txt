### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss experiment where a counter `CNT` decrements from a starting value (e.g., 4) to 0. At each step, if the coin lands heads (`coin(CNT)`), the success count `SC` increments by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and identify any failures or edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure during evaluation. The error message is as follows:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_builtin.py", line 887, in _builtin_is
    check_mode((a, b), ["*g"], functor="is", **k)
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_builtin.py", line 630, in check_mode
    raise CallModeError(functor, args, accepted, location=location)
problog.engine_builtin.CallModeError: Invalid argument types for call to 'is/2': arguments: (X1, X2+1), expected: (any, ground) at 11:8.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(total(_))`  
  - **Expected:** Successful execution with probabilistic results for `total(S)`.  
  - **Actual:** Error due to invalid argument types in the `is/2` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The error occurs in the following predicate:  
```prolog
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(CNT),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1),
    SC is SC1 + 1.
```
- **Line Number Interval:** Lines 11–12 (approximate, based on the error location).  
- **Issue:** The `is/2` predicate expects the second argument to be ground (fully instantiated), but `SC1 + 1` is not ground at the time of evaluation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The recursive logic is sound, but the implementation violates ProbLog's mode restrictions for the `is/2` predicate. The variable `SC1` is not instantiated before the arithmetic operation `SC is SC1 + 1`.  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  The code does not explicitly violate probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`), as the issue is syntactic rather than semantic.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical structure is correct, but execution fails due to syntactic error).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not fully verified due to the failure.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle cases where `CNT` is non-positive (though the recursive base case `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` is correctly defined).  
  - Performance for deep recursion (large `CNT`) is untested.

| 2      | No DeepProbLog features          | N/A                             | Report "DeepProbLog feature not used".                                      |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Notes:**  
The primary issue is the violation of ProbLog's mode restrictions for arithmetic operations. Fixing the `is/2` predicate usage will resolve the error. The logical structure of the code is otherwise sound. Edge cases and performance for large inputs should be tested further.
