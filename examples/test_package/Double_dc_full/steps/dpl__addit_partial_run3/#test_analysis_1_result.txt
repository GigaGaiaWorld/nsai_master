### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of `digit/2` facts representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0 to 9). It also includes an `addition/3` rule to perform addition on the digits represented by two images. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**: `query(addition(img_5, img_6, Z))`  
  - **Result**: `addition(img_5, img_6, 11) = 1.0000`  
  - **Verification**: The result is correct as `5 + 6 = 11`.  

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The code correctly implements the addition logic for the given inputs.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**: All queries returned the expected results.  
- **Expansion Predicates**: No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in the provided code.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The `addition/3` rule is logically correct. It retrieves the digits associated with the input images and computes their sum.  
- **Recursive Termination**: No recursion is used in the provided code, so termination is not a concern.  

##### **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The `digit/2` facts are deterministic (probability 1.0). No probabilistic facts or negations are used.  
- **Implications**: No implications or probabilistic rules are applied.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in the provided code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly performs addition based on the given `digit/2` facts.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic facts or rules.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: The code does not handle cases where `digit/2` facts are missing for input images. For example, `addition(img_10, img_11, Z)` would fail.  
- **Non-List Input**: Not applicable, as the code does not process lists.  
- **Performance**: No deep recursion or performance-intensive operations are present.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | No handling of undefined `digit/2` facts | Potential runtime errors for invalid inputs | Add checks for undefined inputs or default behavior. |
| 2      | No probabilistic reasoning features | Limited to deterministic logic | Extend with probabilistic facts or rules if needed. |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog integration | No neural network fusion | Consider integrating `nn/3` for advanced use cases. |

**Final Remarks**: The provided ProbLog code is functionally correct for the given requirements but lacks robustness for edge cases and advanced features like probabilistic reasoning or DeepProbLog integration. Addressing these limitations would enhance its versatility.
