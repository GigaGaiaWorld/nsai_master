### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a meta-interpreter for proving goals and extends it with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog semantics.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result (Probability) |
|-------|----------------------|
| `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(expand(double(3),6))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` | 0.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (probability = 0.0000 for all queries).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The following predicates are missing or incorrectly implemented:

1. **`implies/2`**:  
   - **Expected:** `implies(A, B)` should succeed if `\+ A` or `B` holds.  
   - **Actual:** The predicate is defined but not integrated into the `prove/1` framework.  
   - **Code Location:** Line with `implies(A, B) :- \+ A; B.`  

2. **`opposite/1`**:  
   - **Expected:** `opposite(A)` should succeed if `A` is false.  
   - **Actual:** Not defined in the code.  

3. **`expand/2`**:  
   - **Expected:** `expand(double(X), Y)` should compute `Y = X * 2`.  
   - **Actual:** The predicate is defined but not integrated into `prove/1`.  

4. **`includes/2`**:  
   - **Expected:** `includes(List, Elem)` should succeed if `Elem` is in `List`.  
   - **Actual:** Not defined in the code.  

5. **`extend/3`**:  
   - **Expected:** `extend(List, Elem, NewList)` should prepend `Elem` to `List`.  
   - **Actual:** Not defined in the code.  

6. **`refute/1`**:  
   - **Expected:** `refute(A)` should succeed if `A` is false.  
   - **Actual:** Not defined in the code.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

- **Classical ProbLog:**  
  - The meta-interpreter (`prove/1`) does not handle the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.).  
  - Recursive termination is correct for `member/2` and `prove/1`, but the extended predicates are not invoked.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog:**  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so probabilistic semantics (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are not applicable.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (basic `prove/1` works, but extended predicates are missing).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not used.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined predicates (`includes/2`, `extend/3`, etc.) cause failures.  
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not tested.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing `opposite/1` | All `opposite` queries fail | Define `opposite(A) :- \+ A.` |
| 2   | Missing `includes/2` | All `includes` queries fail | Define `includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).` |
| 3   | Missing `extend/3` | All `extend` queries fail | Define `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).` |
| 4   | Missing `refute/1` | Not tested | Define `refute(A) :- \+ A.` |
| 5   | `implies/2` not integrated | `implies` queries fail | Add `prove(implies(A, B)) :- \+ A; B.` to `prove/1` |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revisions to implement the extended predicates and integrate them into the meta-interpreter. Probabilistic and DeepProbLog features are not utilized.
