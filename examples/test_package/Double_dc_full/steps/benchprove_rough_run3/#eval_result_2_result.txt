  "ErrorSummary": "The code block defines `implies/2` but does not implement the other required predicates (`opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/2`, `refute/1`). Additionally, the meta-interpreter does not integrate these predicates, causing all test queries to fail.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add missing predicates: `opposite(A) :- \\+ A.`, `includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).`, `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).`, `refute(A) :- \\+ prove(A).`. 2. Ensure `expand/2` uses existing rules (e.g., `expand(double(X), Y) :- Y is X*2.`). 3. Integrate all predicates into the meta-interpreter by extending `prove/1` to handle these cases.",
