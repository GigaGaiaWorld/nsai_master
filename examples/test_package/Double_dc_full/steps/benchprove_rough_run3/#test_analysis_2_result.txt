### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a basic meta-interpreter for ProbLog, along with extended logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:  

| Query | Result (Probability) |
|-------|----------------------|
| `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(expand(double(3),6))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(includes([a, b, c],b))` | 0.0000 |
| `prove(extend([1, 2],3,[3, 1, 2]))` | 0.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests failed (probability 0.0000 for all queries).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
The failures indicate that none of the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`) are correctly implemented or accessible in the current scope.  

- **Missing Predicates:**  
  - `implies/2`: Defined but not integrated into the meta-interpreter.  
  - `opposite/1`: Not defined.  
  - `expand/2`: Defined for `double/1` and `square/1` but not linked to the meta-interpreter.  
  - `includes/2`: Not defined.  
  - `extend/3`: Not defined.  
  - `refute/1`: Not defined.  

- **Code Line Numbers:**  
  - The `implies/2` predicate is defined but not used in the meta-interpreter (line 10).  
  - Other predicates are entirely missing.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
  - The meta-interpreter (`prove/1`) does not handle the extended predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.).  
  - Recursive termination is correct for `member/2` and `prove/1`, but the extended predicates are not invoked.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The test results show 0.0000 probabilities, indicating that the predicates are either not defined or not accessible.  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code.  

- **DeepProbLog:**  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (basic meta-interpreter works, but extended predicates are missing).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Undefined `expand/2` for non-numeric inputs.  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` would fail.  
  - Deep recursion performance is untested.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Missing `opposite/1` | Queries fail | Define `opposite(A) :- \+ A.` |
| 2   | Missing `includes/2` | Queries fail | Define `includes(List, Elem) :- member(Elem, List).` |
| 3   | Missing `extend/3` | Queries fail | Define `extend(List, Elem, [Elem|List]).` |
| 4   | Missing `refute/1` | Not tested | Define `refute(A) :- \+ prove(A).` |
| 5   | `implies/2` not integrated | Queries fail | Add `implies(A, B) :- \+ A; B.` to meta-interpreter. |
| 6   | No probabilistic facts | No probabilistic reasoning | Add probabilistic facts/rules if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires significant revisions to meet the functional requirements, particularly the implementation of missing predicates and their integration into the meta-interpreter.
