### Evaluation Report: Prolog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Interpretable Bubblesort Implementation in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in Prolog, which is then wrapped in a `forth_sort/2` predicate for testing. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards. The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passes with a probability of 1.0000, indicating that the sorting is correct.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures** were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, etc.), so this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The `bubblesort/3` predicate correctly implements the bubble sort algorithm. The recursive termination is ensured by the base case `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`, and the `bubble/3` predicate handles the pairwise comparisons and swaps.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursion terminates because the `bubble/3` predicate reduces the list size by one element in each iteration, eventually reaching the base case.

##### **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so compliance with probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) is not applicable.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  The implementation meets the requirement of classical reasoning, as it correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  Not applicable, as the code does not involve probabilistic elements.  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  Not applicable, as the code does not use DeepProbLog features.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs, which could lead to errors. For example, `forth_sort(123, X)` would fail.  
- **Performance**:  
  The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  No undefined predicates are used in the provided code.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Performance (O(n²))      | Inefficient for large lists     | Consider optimizing or using a more efficient algorithm. |

---

#### **Conclusion**  
The `bubblesort/3` implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may suffer from performance issues with large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

bubblesort(L, Acc, Sorted) :-
    bubble(L, NewL, Last),
    bubblesort(NewL, [Last | Acc], Sorted).

bubble([X], [], X).
bubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :-
    (H1 =< H2, X1 = H1, bubble([H2 | T], T1, X)) ;
    (H1 > H2, X1 = H2, bubble([H1 | T], T1, X)).
