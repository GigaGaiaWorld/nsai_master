  "ErrorSummary": "The `->/2` operator is not recognized in ProbLog, causing the sorting algorithm to fail at the first comparison.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the `->/2` operator with an explicit `if-then-else` structure or use ProbLog-compatible constructs. For example, rewrite the `bubble/3` predicate as follows:\n\n```prolog\nbubble([H1, H2 | T], [X1 | T1], X) :-\n    (H1 =< H2, X1 = H1, bubble([H2 | T], T1, X));\n    (H1 > H2, X1 = H2, bubble([H1 | T], T1, X)).\n```\n\nAdditionally, consider adding input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`) to handle non-list inputs gracefully.",
