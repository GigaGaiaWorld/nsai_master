### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including the rules for determining the outcome of moves and calculating the winner of a sequence of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
```
**Verification:**  
- The result is correct. Player 2 wins because they have two wins (`paper` beats `rock` and `paper` beats `rock`) and one loss (`scissor` loses to `rock`), resulting in a net score of `-1` (player2 wins).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- `move/1` and `beats/2` define the game rules.  
- `outcome/3` determines the result of a single move.  
- `play/3` recursively processes lists of moves.  
- `compute_score/2` calculates the net score.  
- `determine_winner/3` uses the above predicates to determine the winner.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `beats/2` and `outcome/3` are logically sound and cover all possible move combinations.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates correctly when the input lists are empty.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `0.5::move(rock).`). Thus, probabilistic rules like `P(Â¬A)=1âˆ’P(A)` are not applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes inputs are lists of valid moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Non-list inputs or invalid moves would cause errors.  
- **Empty Lists:** Handled correctly by `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.  
- **Deep Recursion:** Performance is acceptable for typical game lengths but could be problematic for very long move sequences.

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. No issues were found in the tested scenario. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic moves or DeepProbLog integration for more advanced use cases.
