### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) and tests their functionality. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [3, 1, 2, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of each stack operation.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are logically sound. For example, `push(X)` correctly prepends `X` to the stack, and `pop` removes the top element.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used in the provided code, so termination is not an issue.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations/implications, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are applicable here.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
**Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All stack operations behave as expected.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` may fail if the stack has insufficient elements.  
- **Performance:** The `sort` operation uses `get_top_n/4` and `append/3`, which are efficient for small stacks but may not scale well for very large stacks.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | Insufficient stack elements for some operations | Runtime error | Add checks for stack size. |
| 3 | Scalability of `sort` operation | Performance issue | Optimize for larger stacks. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The code is functionally correct for the tested cases. However, edge cases and scalability should be addressed for robustness.
