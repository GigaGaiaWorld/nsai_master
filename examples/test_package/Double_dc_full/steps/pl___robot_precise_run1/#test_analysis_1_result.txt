### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot navigates between locations while potentially carrying a key. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like `pickup`, `goto`, and `drop`, as well as deterministic rules for state transitions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:

- **Query 1:** `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))`  
  **Result:** `0.4331`  
- **Query 2:** `at(_,_,s(s(s(0))))`  
  **Sub-results:**  
  - `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
  - `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
  - `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
  - `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
  - `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
  - `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, given the probabilistic rules and initial conditions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. Below is a verification of the key predicates:

- **`at/3` for Robot Movement (Hash: 87A71821):**  
  - Correctly models the robot's movement based on `goto` actions and their success/failure.
- **`at/3` for Key Position (Hash: 75160384):**  
  - Accurately reflects the key's position based on whether the robot is carrying it.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) terminate correctly due to the base cases (`slippery(key,0)` and `carrying(key,T)` with no further actions).
- Logical correctness is ensured by the use of negation-as-failure (`\+`) and proper state transitions.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The computation of probabilities adheres to the rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`: For example, `pickup_fails(T) = 0.3` when `pickup_succeeds(T) = 0.7`.
  - Implications are handled correctly (e.g., `drops(key,T)` depends on `slippery(key,T)`).

**DeepProbLog:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The deterministic rules for robot and key movement are correctly implemented.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic facts and their dependencies are accurately modeled.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases such as:
  - No `goto` action (`goto_action(T)` is false).
  - Key dropping due to `slippery` or `fumbles_key`.
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The code is well-structured, logically correct, and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are suggested at this time.
