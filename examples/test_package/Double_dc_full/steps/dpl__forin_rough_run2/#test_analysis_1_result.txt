### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in ProbLog: Logical Correctness and Test Verification**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following test was executed:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` function as intended.  

**Verified Predicates:**  
- `insertion_sort/2` (Lines 1–3)  
- `insert/3` (Lines 4–8)  

**Expansion Predicates:**  
- No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) were used or required for this implementation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical Prolog Context:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm correctly implements insertion sort by recursively sorting the tail of the list and inserting the head into the sorted tail.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` ensures termination for empty lists, and the recursive case reduces the problem size with each call.  

**ProbLog Context:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation. The result is deterministic (probability 1.0000).  
- **Negations/Implications:** Not applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** The code does not involve neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause a type error.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow (typical for Prolog).

**Code Block for Reference:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([Head|Tail], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(Tail, SortedTail),
    insert(Head, SortedTail, Sorted).
insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [Y|Tail], [X,Y|Tail]) :-
    X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|Tail], [Y|SortedTail]) :-
    X > Y,
    insert(X, Tail, SortedTail).
```
