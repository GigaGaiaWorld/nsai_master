### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves to different locations. The code includes probabilistic facts and rules to simulate the success or failure of actions like picking up the key or moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  
- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5572`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.3700`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, where the robot successfully picks up the key and moves to `loc2` with the specified probabilities.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. The following predicates were verified:  
- `carrying/2`: Correctly models the pickup and retention of the key.  
- `at/3`: Accurately represents the robot's and key's positions.  
- Probabilistic facts (`pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, etc.): Comply with ProbLog's probabilistic rules.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) terminate correctly, and the rules are logically sound.  
- **Negation as Failure:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is appropriate, e.g., in `carrying(key,s(T)) :- carrying(key, T), \+ drops(key, T).`  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities are correctly computed. For example, `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is respected in `pickup_succeeds/1` and `pickup_fails/1`.  
- **Implications:** No explicit implications are used, but the rules correctly model probabilistic dependencies (e.g., `drops/2` depends on `slippery/2`).  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key handling.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly defined and computed.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are present.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable here.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable (e.g., `s(s(s(0)))`), and performance is not an issue.
