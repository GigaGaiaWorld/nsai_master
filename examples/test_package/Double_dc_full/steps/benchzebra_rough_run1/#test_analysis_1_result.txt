### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly checks adjacency using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly checks if one element is immediately to the right of another in a list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The constraints in the `zebra/1` predicate are logically sound and correctly encode the puzzle rules.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate correctly for finite lists.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The puzzle does not use probabilistic facts, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are applied.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not use neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.  
- **Non-list Input:** The predicates assume list inputs, but no checks are performed. This could lead to runtime errors if non-list inputs are provided.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the fixed list size (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for list arguments. |
| 2      | DeepProbLog features unused | N/A | Consider extending the model with probabilistic facts or neural networks if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation is correct and adheres to the puzzle's requirements. No failures were detected, and the code is logically sound. However, minor improvements (e.g., input validation) could enhance robustness.
