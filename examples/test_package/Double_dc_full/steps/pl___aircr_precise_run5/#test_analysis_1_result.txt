### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al. (2013). The system simulates the movement of a flap from an initial position to a goal position, considering actuator strength, wind effects, and potential overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include probabilities for `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` for time steps 1 to 5. The results are as follows:

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but increase slightly with time.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts and deterministic rules interact as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The code correctly implements the logic for calculating the flap position, considering actuator strength, wind effects, and goal conditions. The recursive termination is ensured by the condition `Time > 0`.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` comply with ProbLog rules. For example:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled by the disjunctive probabilities in `use_actuator`.
  - The wind effects are correctly modeled with distinct probabilities for weak and strong wind scenarios.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`) are used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The deterministic rules (e.g., `legal_flap_position`, `actuator_strength`) are correctly implemented.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The probabilistic facts (e.g., `wind`, `wind_effect`) and their interactions are sound.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases such as illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception`) and ensures termination.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
