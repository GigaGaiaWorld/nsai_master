    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Error Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Non-Ground Probabilistic Clause Error in ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of heads (`S`). However, the code fails with a `NonGroundProbabilisticClause` error. This report analyzes the error, its root cause, and suggests corrections.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
  ```
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to a non-ground probabilistic clause.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate:** `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).`
  - **Line:** 1:5 (the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C, 0.8)` is non-ground).
- **Expected Behavior:** Probabilistic facts must be ground (i.e., `C` must be instantiated).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Logical Correctness:**  
   - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically sound but relies on `coin(C)`, which is non-ground.
   - ProbLog requires probabilistic facts (e.g., `make_coin(C, 0.8)`) to be ground (i.e., `C` must be a constant).

2. **Probabilistic Rules Violation:**  
   - The clause `coin(C) :- make_coin(C, 0.8).` violates ProbLog's requirement that probabilistic facts must not contain unbound variables.

3. **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
   - **Not used.** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but non-ground facts break it).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Failed (non-ground probabilistic clause).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-ground Probabilistic Facts:** Overlooked in the design.
  - **Recursive Performance:** Not an issue here, but deep recursion could be problematic for large `CNT`.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | Code fails to execute           | Replace `coin(C)` with ground facts (e.g., `coin(c1). coin(c2). ...`).     |
| 2   | Unbound variable in `make_coin`  | ProbLog rejects non-ground facts | Use a list of coins (e.g., `[c1, c2, c3, c4]`) and iterate deterministically. |

---

#### **8. Corrected Code Example**
```prolog
% Ground probabilistic facts
0.8::coin(c1). 0.8::coin(c2). 0.8::coin(c3). 0.8::coin(c4).

% Recursive accumulator
coins_r(SC, SC, 0).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    (coin(c1) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC is SC),
    NCNT is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(NSC, S, NCNT).

total(S) :- coins_r(0, S, 4).
query(total(_)).
```

---

#### **9. Final Notes**
- **Word Count:** ~450 words.
- **Tone:** Formal and technical.
- **Recommendation:** Always ensure probabilistic facts are ground. For dynamic coin generation, use deterministic iteration over a fixed list.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
