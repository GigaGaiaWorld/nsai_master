### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin `CNT` times and accumulate the number of heads (`SC`). The final result `S` should represent the total number of heads after `CNT` tosses. The code uses recursion and probabilistic facts to achieve this. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:  
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 8:15.
```

- **Failed Query**: `query(total(_))`  
- **Expected Result**: A probabilistic distribution of the total number of heads after 4 coin tosses.  
- **Actual Result**: Error due to an undefined implication operator (`->`).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location**: Line 8, Column 15 in the `coins_r` predicate.  
- **Problematic Code Block**:  
  ```prolog
  (coin(c1) -> NSC is SC + 1 ; NSC is SC),
  ```
- **Issue**: The implication operator `->` is not correctly defined or supported in the current ProbLog context.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive logic in `coins_r` is sound, but the use of `->` for conditional branching is incorrect in ProbLog. ProbLog does not support Prolog's `->` operator directly for probabilistic facts.  
  - The predicate `coin(c1)` is defined as a probabilistic fact, but the implication is not handled correctly.  

- **Probabilistic Rules Compliance**:  
  - The code does not violate probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` because the error occurs before these rules are applied.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - **Not used** in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met, but the conditional logic fails.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not fully met due to the error.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The code does not handle edge cases like `CNT = 0` explicitly, though the base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)` is correctly defined.  
  - The undefined `->` operator is a critical oversight.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Undefined `->` operator          | Prevents execution of the query | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if_then_else`). |
| 2   | Probabilistic fact handling      | Incorrect branching logic       | Use `probabilistic_fact` or explicit probabilistic rules for branching.    |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the problematic line with ProbLog-compatible logic:  
```prolog
if(coin(c1), NSC is SC + 1, NSC is SC),
```
Ensure the `if/3` predicate is defined or use a library that supports probabilistic branching.
