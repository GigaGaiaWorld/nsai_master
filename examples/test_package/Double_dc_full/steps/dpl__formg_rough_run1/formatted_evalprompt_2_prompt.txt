 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

In this phase, you'll receive the output from the first chain along with the original code blocks. Your task is to evaluate each <langda> code block individually and determine if it needs regeneration.

### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability is correctly reported as `1.0000`, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` function as intended. The recursive termination conditions are correctly defined, and the algorithm handles the input list appropriately.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The logical correctness of the merge sort algorithm is confirmed. The recursive calls terminate correctly for base cases (`[]` and `[X]`), and the splitting and merging operations are logically sound.
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` are not applicable here.

- **DeepProbLog Scenario:**
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.** The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`), so no fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is required.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in classical Prolog.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case, as the implementation is deterministic.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to unexpected behavior.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The algorithm is recursive and may face performance issues with very large lists due to stack limits.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used in this implementation.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Performance issues | Consider iterative implementation for large datasets. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this code. 

**Word Count:** 350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
