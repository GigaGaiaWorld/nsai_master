### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]) = 1.0000
```
**Expected Result:**
The sorted list should be `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`.

**Conclusion:**
- **Test Failed**: The output `[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]` is incorrect.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X).
```
**Actual Output:** `[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]`  
**Expected Output:** `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`

**Error Location:**
- The error lies in the `merge/3` predicate (lines 10â€“17). The merging logic is incorrect, leading to an unsorted output.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- **Logical Correctness**: The `merge/3` predicate fails to correctly merge two sorted lists. The current implementation does not ensure the merged list is sorted.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion terminates correctly, but the merging step is flawed.

**ProbLog Analysis:**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: No probabilistic facts are used in this example.
- **DeepProbLog Features**: Not applicable (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (incorrect merging logic).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input**: Not handled (e.g., `merge_sort(123, X)` would fail).
- **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for typical list sizes.
- **Empty List**: Correctly handled.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Incorrect merging logic in `merge/3` | Output list is not sorted       | Rewrite `merge/3` to ensure sorted merging |
| 2      | No probabilistic facts used      | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic facts if required         |
| 3      | Non-list input not handled       | Program crashes                 | Add input validation                        |

---

#### **Code Corrections**
Here is the corrected `merge/3` predicate:
```prolog
merge([], L, L).
merge(L, [], L).
merge([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], [X|Zs]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Xs, [Y|Ys], Zs).
merge([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X|Xs], Ys, Zs).
```

---

#### **Final Remarks**
The `merge_sort/2` implementation requires corrections to the merging logic. Once fixed, it will meet classical reasoning requirements. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are currently utilized. Edge cases like non-list inputs should be addressed for robustness.
