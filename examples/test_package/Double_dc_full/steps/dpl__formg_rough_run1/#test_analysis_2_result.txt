### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Identify edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability is correctly reported as `1.0000`, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` function as intended. The recursive termination conditions are correctly defined, and the algorithm handles the input list appropriately.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The logical correctness of the merge sort algorithm is confirmed. The recursive calls terminate correctly for base cases (`[]` and `[X]`), and the splitting and merging operations are logically sound.
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` are not applicable here.

- **DeepProbLog Scenario:**
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.** The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`), so no fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is required.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in classical Prolog.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this case, as the implementation is deterministic.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to unexpected behavior.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The algorithm is recursive and may face performance issues with very large lists due to stack limits.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used in this implementation.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Performance issues | Consider iterative implementation for large datasets. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The `merge_sort/2` implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this code.
