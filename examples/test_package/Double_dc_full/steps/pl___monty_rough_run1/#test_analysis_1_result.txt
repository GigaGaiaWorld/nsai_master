### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules.
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (uniform distribution).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic and correct.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` match the expected probabilities (1/3 and 2/3, respectively).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:
1. **Uniform Random Opening:** When two doors are available, the `open_door/1` predicate ensures a 50% probability for each.
2. **Forced Opening:** When only one door is available, it is opened deterministically.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` correctly handle the two cases specified.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates for finite lists.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` is correct.
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+` (negation) in `win_switch` and `open_door` complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.

**DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (e.g., `prize/1`, `open_door/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., doors 1, 2, or 3).
- **Performance:** No deep recursion or performance issues detected.

        member(OtherDoor, [1,2,3]),
        \+ prize(OtherDoor),
        \+ (OtherDoor = Selected),
        \+ (OtherDoor = Door)
    ), Doors),
    length(Doors, 2),
    member(Door, Doors),
    0.5::open_door(Door).
