### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, recursive termination, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```problog
query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```problog
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `bubblesort/3`, `bubble/3`, and `swap/3` function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `swap/3` predicate correctly determines whether to swap elements based on their values (`X > Y` or `X =< Y`).  
  - The `bubble/3` predicate recursively processes the list to move the largest element to the end.  
  - The `bubblesort/3` predicate recursively sorts the remaining list and builds the sorted result.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The base case `bubblesort([], L, L)` ensures termination when the input list is empty.  
  - The recursive case reduces the problem size by one element in each iteration, ensuring termination for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). It operates purely deterministically.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the bubble sort algorithm.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `bubblesort([], L, L)`.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow (typical for Prolog implementations).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error                   | Add input validation for lists.      |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow        | Optimize for tail recursion.         |
| 3      | No probabilistic features | Limited to deterministic logic  | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is logically correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Enhancements could include input validation and optimization for large datasets.
