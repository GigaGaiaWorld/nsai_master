### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle that demonstrates counterintuitive probabilistic reasoning. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Logical consistency of rules.
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities are consistent with the expected behavior of the Monty Hall problem:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any of the three doors (`prize/1`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is 1/3.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is 2/3.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the requirements:
- The host opens a door randomly when two doors are unselected and empty.
- The host opens the only empty door when one unselected door hides the prize.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` correctly handle the two cases:
  1. Two unselected empty doors (random choice).
  2. One unselected empty door (deterministic choice).
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly defined and terminates for finite lists.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The distribution `1/3::prize(1) ; 1/3::prize(2) ; 1/3::prize(3)` is correct.
- **Negations/Implications:** The use of `\+` (negation-as-failure) complies with `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.

**DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules for `open_door/1` and `member/2` are logically sound.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with the Monty Hall problem's expected outcomes.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not relevant here.
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures valid lists (`[1,2,3]`).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The implementation is correct and aligns with the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic behavior. No issues were identified.
