### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed:**  
  ```prolog
  query(zebra(Houses)).
  ```
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**  
  The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, where all constraints are satisfied. The probability of `1.0000` indicates certainty in the solution.  
  **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly checks adjacency using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly checks if one element is immediately to the right of another in a list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The predicates `my_member/2`, `next_to/3`, and `right_of/3` are logically sound and terminate correctly for valid inputs.  
  - The `zebra/1` predicate enforces all puzzle constraints without contradictions.  

- **Probabilistic Soundness:**  
  - The solution does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are applied.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
  - **Non-list Input:** The predicates assume list inputs; non-list inputs would fail.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~350 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the requirements. No issues were identified during testing. The solution is robust for the given problem constraints.
