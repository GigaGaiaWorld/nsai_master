### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result provided is as follows:  
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```  
- **All tests passed (no failures)**  
  The result satisfies all the given requirements, as evidenced by the correct assignment of attributes to each house. The probability of 1.0000 indicates certainty in the solution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
  All predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the output aligns with the expected solution. The following predicates were verified:  
  - `my_member/2`  
  - `right_of/3`  
  - `next_to/3`  
  - `houses/1`  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The code adheres to the logical constraints of the puzzle. For example:  
  - The `right_of/3` predicate correctly enforces the spatial relationship between the green and ivory houses.  
  - The `next_to/3` predicate ensures adjacency constraints (e.g., the Norwegian lives next to the blue house).  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  All recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) terminate correctly due to proper base cases and list traversal.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The solution does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are applied.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **DeepProbLog feature not used**:  
  The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes valid input (a list of houses). No edge cases for invalid input are handled.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to the number of houses (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

### **Conclusion**  
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is correct and meets all specified requirements. The solution is logically sound, and no failures were detected during testing. The absence of probabilistic or DeepProbLog features is noted, but this does not affect the correctness of the classical reasoning.
