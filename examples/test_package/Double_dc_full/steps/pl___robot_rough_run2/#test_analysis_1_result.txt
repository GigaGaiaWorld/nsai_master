### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic facts and rules to simulate the success or failure of actions like picking up the key or moving to a new location. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query                              | Probability Result |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `carrying(key,s(s(s(0))))`         | 0.5898             |
| `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0))))`        | 0.9000             |
| `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0))))`        | 0.0900             |
| `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0))))`        | 0.0100             |
| `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0))))`          | 0.5670             |
| `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0))))`          | 0.4330             |
| `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0))))`          | 0.0000             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, where the robot successfully picks up the key and moves to `loc2` with high probability, while the key's location is updated accordingly.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive definitions (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) terminate correctly due to the base cases (`initially_slippery(key)` and `at/3` at time `0`).  
- Logical correctness is ensured by the proper use of negation (`\+`) and implications (e.g., `drops/2`).  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probabilities comply with the rules:  
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`: For example, `pickup_fails(T) = 1 - pickup_succeeds(T) = 0.3`.  
  - `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`: This is implicitly handled by the independent choice logic.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and key pickup.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and propagated.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- Undefined `expand/2`: Not applicable here.  
- Non-list input: Not relevant for this model.  
- Deep recursive performance: The recursion depth is limited by the time steps (`s(T)`), ensuring performance is manageable.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic and classical reasoning components are correctly implemented, and the test results confirm the model's accuracy. No issues or edge cases were overlooked.
