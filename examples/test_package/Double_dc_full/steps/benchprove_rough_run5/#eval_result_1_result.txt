  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core logic. All predicates (implies/2, opposite/1, expand/2, includes/2, extend/3, refute/1) function as required. Edge cases (e.g., undefined expand/2 rules, non-list inputs) are not critical errors but could be improved.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Optional enhancements: (1) Add input validation for list arguments in includes/2 and extend/3. (2) Define additional expand/2 rules for broader use cases. (3) Add cycle detection for ancestor/2 if cycles are possible in the knowledge base.",
