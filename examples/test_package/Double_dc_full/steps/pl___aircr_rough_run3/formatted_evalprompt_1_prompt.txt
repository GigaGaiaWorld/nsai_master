<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller with Error Diagnosis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to position 4 over a series of time steps. The code includes probabilistic facts for actuator selection and wind effects, as well as deterministic rules for flap movement and goal verification.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
1. Verify the correctness of the code.
2. Diagnose the `UnknownClause` error encountered during testing.
3. Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure with the following error:
```
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 33:207.
```
This error suggests that the ProbLog engine encountered an undefined or improperly formatted clause during execution. No query results were produced due to this error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The error occurs during the evaluation of the ProbLog model, preventing any queries from being executed.
- **Error Location**: The error is reported at line 33, column 207, but the exact predicate or rule causing the issue is unclear due to the generic nature of the error message.
- **Potential Culprit**: The error may stem from:
  - An undefined or malformed clause in the `attempted_flap_position` rule.
  - A missing or improperly formatted probabilistic fact or rule.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Analysis**:
  - The `attempted_flap_position` rule is recursive and depends on `flap_position`, `goal_reached`, and `use_actuator`. The recursion appears logically sound, but the error suggests a grounding issue (e.g., uninstantiated variables).
  - The `UnknownClause` error typically occurs when the engine encounters a call to an undefined predicate or a non-ground probabilistic clause.

- **Probabilistic Analysis**:
  - The probabilistic facts (`use_actuator`, `wind`, `wind_effect`) are correctly defined and comply with ProbLog's rules (e.g., probabilities sum to 1).
  - The error may arise from the interaction between deterministic and probabilistic rules, particularly if variables are not properly instantiated before probabilistic evaluation.

- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met, but the `UnknownClause` error prevents full evaluation.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly implemented for actuator and wind effects, but the error suggests a grounding issue.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Predicates**: The error suggests an undefined or malformed clause.
  - **Non-Ground Clauses**: The `attempted_flap_position` rule may contain uninstantiated variables during probabilistic evaluation.
  - **Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, so performance is not a concern.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `UnknownClause` error at 33:207  | Prevents all queries from running | Check for undefined predicates or non-ground clauses in `attempted_flap_position`. |
| 2   | Potential grounding issue        | Probabilistic evaluation fails  | Ensure all variables in probabilistic clauses are instantiated before use.  |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Debugging Steps**:
   - Inspect the `attempted_flap_position` rule for uninstantiated variables.
   - Verify the syntax of all probabilistic and deterministic clauses.
   - Use `unknown(fail)` to handle undefined predicates gracefully.

2. **Code Fix**:
   - Ensure the `attempted_flap_position` rule is fully defined and all variables are instantiated before probabilistic evaluation.

3. **Testing**:
   - After fixing the error, re-run the queries to verify correctness.

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

This report provides a structured analysis of the error and suggests actionable steps for resolution. Let me know if you'd like further details or assistance with debugging.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
