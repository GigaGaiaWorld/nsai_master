### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of a flap from an initial position to a goal position, considering actuator strength, wind effects, and probabilistic choices. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the probabilities of `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` for time steps 1 to 5. Here are the results:

| Query                | Probability |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2200      |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1836      |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1341      |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0938      |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0651      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0300      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0165      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0187      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0136      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0125      |

**Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities are consistent with the expected behavior of the system, given the probabilistic choices and constraints.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned probabilities that align with the system's design. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and no discrepancies were found.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**
- **Logical Correctness**: The rules for `attempted_flap_position`, `flap_position`, and `overrun_exception` are logically sound. The recursion terminates correctly as the time steps are bounded by `at(5)`.
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursion is well-defined and terminates at the specified time limit (`at(5)`).

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**
- **Probabilistic Facts**: The probabilities for `use_actuator`, `wind`, and `wind_effect` comply with the rules of probability theory (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
- **Negations/Implications**: The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled, and the implications in the rules are consistent with probabilistic reasoning.

##### **DeepProbLog**
- **Neural Network Integration**: The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
##### **Functional Requirements**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The system correctly models the flap movement and exceptions.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities are computed correctly, and the system accounts for uncertainties in actuator choice and wind effects.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.

##### **Edge Cases**
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not used in the code.
- **Non-list Input**: Not applicable.
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion is shallow (bounded by `at(5)`), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

**Final Remarks**: The code is well-designed and meets all specified requirements. The test results confirm its correctness, and no issues were identified during the evaluation.
