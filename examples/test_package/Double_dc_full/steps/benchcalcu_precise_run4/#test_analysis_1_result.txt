### Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The puzzle requires that:  
- Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9).  
- The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
- The addition must account for carry-over operations.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`, all with a probability of `1.0000`.  

**Test Results:**  
1. `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`  
2. `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`  
3. `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`  
4. `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`  
5. `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`  
6. `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`  
7. `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`  
8. `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`  
9. `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`  
10. `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the puzzle's requirements, and no discrepancies were found.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`: Ensure valid digits and no leading zeros.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly handles addition and carry-over.  

All predicates are correctly defined and function as intended.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to the puzzle's logical constraints. Recursive predicates (e.g., `all_different/1`) terminate correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The results are deterministic (probability `1.0000`), so no probabilistic facts or negations are involved.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using classical Prolog predicates.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid inputs (digits 0-9). Non-list inputs or invalid digits would fail.  
- **Performance:** The recursive `all_different/1` predicate is efficient for small lists but may slow down for larger inputs.  

**Suggestions:**  
- Add input validation for robustness.  
- Consider optimizing `all_different/1` for larger puzzles.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors were found.  

**Word Count:** ~450 words.
