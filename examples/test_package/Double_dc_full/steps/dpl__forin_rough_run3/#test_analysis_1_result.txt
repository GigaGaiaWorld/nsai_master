### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in Prolog. The goal is to verify its correctness, adherence to Prolog conventions, and compliance with the requirements of being interpretable. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, recursive termination, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully. The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `insertion_sort/2` (lines 1–3)  
  - `insert/3` (lines 4–6)  
  All predicates are correctly defined and adhere to Prolog conventions.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Analysis**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The algorithm correctly implements insertion sort by recursively sorting the tail of the list and inserting the head into the sorted tail.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The base case (`insertion_sort([], []).`) ensures termination for empty lists, and the recursive case reduces the problem size with each call (`insertion_sort(T, SortedTail)`).  
  - **Edge Cases**:  
    - Empty list: Handled by the base case.  
    - Single-element list: Handled by `insert(X, [], [X]).`  
    - Non-list input: Not explicitly handled (potential runtime error).  

- **ProbLog Analysis**:  
  - The result is deterministic (`1.0000`), indicating no probabilistic facts or rules are involved.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no `nn/3`, `tensor/…`, or related calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly sorts the input list.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features).  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The program may fail if the input is not a list.  
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow (not tested).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error              | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Potential stack overflow   | Optimize for tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

#### **Code Block for Reference**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([], []).
insertion_sort([H|T], Sorted) :-
    insertion_sort(T, SortedTail),
    insert(H, SortedTail, Sorted).
insert(X, [], [X]).
insert(X, [Y|T], [X,Y|T]) :- X =< Y.
insert(X, [Y|T], [Y|Sorted]) :- X > Y, insert(X, T, Sorted).
```

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and concise.  
**Conclusion**: The code meets classical Prolog requirements but lacks handling for non-list inputs and potential performance optimizations. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
