#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Code in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code solves a cryptoaddition problem where the goal is to find unique digits for the variables `A, B, C, D, E` such that the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` holds. The code enforces constraints like non-zero leading digits, uniqueness of digits, and column-wise addition with carry propagation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions, each with a probability of `1.0000`. Here are the results:  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the constraints and logic of the cryptoaddition problem.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:  
- `leftdigit/1` ensures non-zero leading digits.  
- `sumdigit/5` correctly handles column-wise addition with carry.  
- `all_different/1` enforces uniqueness of digits.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code adheres to the problem's logical constraints. For example, the `sumdigit` predicate correctly computes the sum and carry for each column.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different` predicate terminates correctly as it checks each element against the remaining list.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)`). Thus, probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition problem.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The `all_different` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures this by design.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited (5 digits), so performance is not an issue.  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.
