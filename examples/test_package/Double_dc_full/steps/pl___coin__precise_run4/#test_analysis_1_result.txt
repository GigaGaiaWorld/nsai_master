### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Coin Toss Simulation Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss experiment where a counter `CNT` decrements from 4 to 0. At each step, if the `CNT`-th coin toss results in heads (with a probability of 0.8), the success count `SC` increments by 1. The final accumulated count is stored in `S`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, recursive logic, and adherence to the requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the query `total(_)` are as follows:  
- `total(4) = 0.4096`  
- `total(3) = 0.4096`  
- `total(2) = 0.1536`  
- `total(1) = 0.0256`  
- `total(0) = 0.0016`  

**Verification:**  
- The probabilities are consistent with the binomial distribution for 4 trials with success probability 0.8.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the recursive logic terminates as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` correctly handles the decrement of `CNT` and updates `SC` based on the outcome of `coin(CNT)`.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case `coins_r(SC, SC, 0)` ensures termination when `CNT` reaches 0.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The probability of `coin(CNT)` being true is 0.8, and its negation (`\+ coin(CNT)`) is correctly computed as `1 - 0.8 = 0.2`.  
- The results align with the probabilistic rules, e.g., `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The recursive logic and termination are correct.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed accurately.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable here.  
- **Non-list Input:** Not relevant for this code.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (4 steps), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The code adheres to the requirements and passes all tests. The probabilistic reasoning is accurate, and the recursive logic is correctly implemented. No issues were identified during the evaluation.

**Code Block for Reference:**  
```prolog
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    coin(CNT),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    SC1 is SC + 1,
    coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1).
coins_r(SC, S, CNT) :-
    CNT > 0,
    \+ coin(CNT),
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
    coins_r(SC, S, CNT1).
```  

This concludes the evaluation report.
