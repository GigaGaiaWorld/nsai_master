             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of times the coin lands heads-up (`S`). The code uses recursion to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a **non-ground probabilistic clause** at line 1:5. The error message is as follows:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = self.handle_nonground(
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
```

**Failed Queries**:  
- The query `total(S)` fails to execute due to the non-ground probabilistic clause in the definition of `coin(C)`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `coin(C)`  
  - **Code Location**: Line 1 (`coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`)  
  - **Issue**: The probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,0.8)` is non-ground because `C` is not instantiated before being used in a probabilistic context. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be ground (i.e., all variables must be bound to specific values).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical reasoning, but the non-ground probabilistic fact disrupts the execution.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the decrementing counter `CNT`.

- **Probabilistic Scenario**:  
  - The error arises because the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,0.8)` is not ground. ProbLog enforces that all probabilistic facts must be ground to compute probabilities correctly.  
  - The negation/implication rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are not violated, but the non-ground clause prevents any probabilistic computation.

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but execution fails due to the non-ground clause).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (non-ground probabilistic fact).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The non-ground probabilistic fact is a critical oversight.  
  - The recursive performance is acceptable for small `CNT`, but deeper recursion may require optimization.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | Prevents execution of the query | Instantiate `C` before using it in `make_coin(C,0.8)`. For example, define `coin(head) :- make_coin(head,0.8).` and `coin(tail) :- make_coin(tail,0.2).`. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires fixing the non-ground probabilistic clause to proceed with testing. Once resolved, the recursive logic should function as intended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
