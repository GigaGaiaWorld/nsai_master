### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to simulate tossing a biased coin (`CNT` times) and accumulate the number of times the coin lands heads-up (`S`). The code uses recursion to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a **non-ground probabilistic clause** at line 1:5. The error message is as follows:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    result = self.handle_nonground(
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 905, in handle_nonground
    raise NonGroundProbabilisticClause(location=database.lineno(node.location))
problog.engine.NonGroundProbabilisticClause: Encountered a non-ground probabilistic clause at 1:5.
```

**Failed Queries**:  
- The query `total(S)` fails to execute due to the non-ground probabilistic clause in the definition of `coin(C)`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate**: `coin(C)`  
  - **Code Location**: Line 1 (`coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8).`)  
  - **Issue**: The probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,0.8)` is non-ground because `C` is not instantiated before being used in a probabilistic context. ProbLog requires probabilistic facts to be ground (i.e., all variables must be bound to specific values).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The recursive predicate `coins_r/3` is logically correct for classical reasoning, but the non-ground probabilistic fact disrupts the execution.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the decrementing counter `CNT`.

- **Probabilistic Scenario**:  
  - The error arises because the probabilistic fact `make_coin(C,0.8)` is not ground. ProbLog enforces that all probabilistic facts must be ground to compute probabilities correctly.  
  - The negation/implication rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are not violated, but the non-ground clause prevents any probabilistic computation.

- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (recursive logic is correct, but execution fails due to the non-ground clause).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not met (non-ground probabilistic fact).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - The non-ground probabilistic fact is a critical oversight.  
  - The recursive performance is acceptable for small `CNT`, but deeper recursion may require optimization.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-ground probabilistic clause  | Prevents execution of the query | Instantiate `C` before using it in `make_coin(C,0.8)`. For example, define `coin(head) :- make_coin(head,0.8).` and `coin(tail) :- make_coin(tail,0.2).`. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires fixing the non-ground probabilistic clause to proceed with testing. Once resolved, the recursive logic should function as intended.
