### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) and tests their functionality. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [3, 1, 2, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of each stack operation.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are logically sound. For example, `push(X)` correctly prepends `X` to the stack, and `pop` removes the top element.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used in the provided code, so termination is not an issue.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations/implications. All operations are deterministic, as evidenced by the probability results (1.0000).  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations perform as specified.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Empty Stack:** Operations like `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` may fail if the stack has fewer elements than required. For example, `swap` requires at least two elements.  
- **Performance:** The `sort` operation uses `get_top_n` and `append`, which are efficient for small stacks but may not scale well for large stacks.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | Empty stack for certain operations | Runtime error | Handle edge cases explicitly. |
| 3 | Scalability of `sort` | Performance degradation | Optimize for larger stacks. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Remarks:** The code is functionally correct for the tested cases. However, edge cases and scalability should be addressed for robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
