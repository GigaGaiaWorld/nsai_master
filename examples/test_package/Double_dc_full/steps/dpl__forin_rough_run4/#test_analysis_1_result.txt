### Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in Prolog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in Prolog. The goal is to verify its correctness, interpretability, and adherence to Prolog's logical and probabilistic rules (if applicable). The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, as no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
**Query:**  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passes with the correct sorted output `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` and a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- The predicates `insertion_sort/2`, `insertion_sort/3`, and `insert/3` are correctly defined and function as expected.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The algorithm correctly implements insertion sort by recursively inserting each element into its proper position in the accumulator.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case `insertion_sort([], Acc, Acc)` ensures termination.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the code. The result `1.0000` indicates deterministic behavior.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm sorts the list correctly.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could cause runtime errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may lead to stack overflow.

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error              | Add input validation.               |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large N | Optimize tail recursion or use loops. |

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is correct for classical Prolog but lacks robustness for edge cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Enhancements for input validation and performance are recommended.  

```prolog
% Suggested improvement for input validation:
insertion_sort(List, Sorted) :- 
    is_list(List), 
    insertion_sort(List, [], Sorted).
```
