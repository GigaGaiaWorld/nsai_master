### Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digits for the equation `AB + BCD = CDE`. The code uses predicates to define digits, enforce constraints (e.g., no leading zeros, all digits distinct), and simulate column-wise addition with carry. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results show the following solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`:
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000`
- `query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each solution satisfies the constraints and correctly solves the puzzle `AB + BCD = CDE`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates (`leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, `sumdigit/5`) are correctly defined and enforce the required constraints. The `query_sum/1` predicate integrates these constraints and arithmetic operations without errors.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `sumdigit/5` correctly handles carry propagation, and `all_different/1` ensures digit uniqueness.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates because the list shrinks with each recursive call (`member/2` is well-defined).

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)`). Thus, probabilistic compliance is not applicable here.

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**
  - The code does not use DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic constraints and arithmetic.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable (not used).
  - **Non-list Input:** The `all_different/1` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures valid input via `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited (maximum 5 digits), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Explanation:** No errors were found. The code meets all requirements and handles edge cases appropriately.

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation is robust and correct for the given cryptoaddition puzzle. No further modifications are required.
