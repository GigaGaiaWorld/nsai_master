### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities are correct:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any door (`1/3`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)` is deterministic).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the door (`win_keep`) is `1/3`.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is `2/3`.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the problem's requirements:
1. **Random Door Opening:** When both unselected doors are empty, one is opened randomly (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).
2. **Deterministic Door Opening:** When one unselected door has no prize, the host opens it (`open_door(A)`).
3. **Winning Conditions:** Correctly defined for both strategies (`win_keep`, `win_switch`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The rules for `open_door` and winning conditions are logically sound.
  - Recursion in `member/2` terminates correctly.
- **Probabilistic Rules:**
  - Probabilities sum to 1 for `prize/1`.
  - Negation (`\+ prize(A)`) is handled correctly (`P(Â¬A) = 1 - P(A)`).
- **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Correctly implemented (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Complies with probabilistic rules (`prize/1`, `open_door/1`).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used.
  - **Non-list Input:** Not applicable (input is fixed).
  - **Deep Recursion:** Not an issue (shallow recursion in `member/2`).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and clear.  
**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all requirements. No issues were found.
