### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division, ensuring robustness. The evaluation verifies the correctness of the implementation and its adherence to the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following queries and their return values (all with a probability of 1.0000):  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246])`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219])`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223])`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77])`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461])`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244])`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477])`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76])`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities, as per the specified inequality constraints.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the arithmetic constraints (`20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1`) are satisfied for all returned pairs.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density using integer arithmetic (`D is (P * 100) // A`), ensuring no floating-point inaccuracies.  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the two countries are distinct (`C1 \= C2`) and their densities are approximately equal (within 5% of each other).  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the query logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code handles integer arithmetic robustly, avoiding division-related issues.  
  - The query ensures distinct countries (`C1 \= C2`), preventing trivial matches.  
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present in the test cases.
