### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work on reliability analysis. The system simulates the movement of a flap under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes for goal achievement and overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code and its test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:

| Query                | Probability |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`    | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`    | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`    | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`    | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`    | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but possible.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the expansion predicates (e.g., `legal_flap_position/1`, `actuator_strength/2`, `wind_effect/2`) are consistent in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive termination is ensured by the condition `Time > 0` and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`. The rules for `attempted_flap_position/2` and `overrun_exception/1` are logically sound.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The probabilities for `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). The results reflect the combined effects of actuator choice and wind strength.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly models the flap's movement and exceptions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are computed correctly and reflect the system's stochastic nature.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog feature not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The system handles illegal flap positions (`legal_flap_position/1`) and overrun exceptions (`overrun_exception/1`) correctly.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
  - Recursive performance is efficient due to the limited time steps (`at(5)`).

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 450 words.  

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The test results confirm its correctness and robustness in both classical and probabilistic scenarios. No improvements are necessary at this time.
