<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle `AB + BCD = CDE`, where each letter represents a unique digit (0-9), and the first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be zero. The solution involves:
- Defining digits and constraints (`digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`).
- Ensuring uniqueness of digits (`all_different/1`).
- Simulating column-wise addition with carry propagation (`sumdigit/5`).

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Executed**: `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`.
- **Result**: `query_sum([X6, X7, X8, X9, X10]) = 0.0000`.

**Interpretation**:
- The result `0.0000` indicates that the query returned no valid solutions. This suggests a failure in the logic or constraints of the puzzle.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`.
- **Expected Result**: A valid assignment of digits to `[A,B,C,D,E]` satisfying `AB + BCD = CDE`.
- **Actual Result**: No valid solution (`0.0000`).

**Specific Predicates/Rules with Issues**:
1. **`sumdigit/5`**:
   - The predicate simulates column-wise addition but may not correctly handle all cases of carry propagation.
   - **Line Interval**: The entire `sumdigit` definition.

2. **`all_different/1`**:
   - Ensures uniqueness but may conflict with the constraints imposed by `sumdigit`.
   - **Line Interval**: The recursive definition of `all_different`.

3. **`leftdigit/1`**:
   - Correctly enforces non-zero first digits but may overly restrict the solution space.
   - **Line Interval**: The single rule defining `leftdigit`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog**:
  - The logical correctness of the puzzle constraints is sound, but the recursive termination of `all_different/1` and the arithmetic in `sumdigit/5` may not cover all edge cases (e.g., carry overflow).
  - The lack of solutions suggests an overly restrictive constraint or an arithmetic error.

- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this example, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The constraints are logically defined, but the implementation fails to find a solution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - **Deep Recursion**: `all_different/1` may cause performance issues for larger lists.
  - **Arithmetic Overflow**: `sumdigit/5` does not handle cases where the sum exceeds 19 (maximum possible with two digits and a carry).

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `sumdigit/5` arithmetic error   | No valid solutions found       | Debug arithmetic and carry propagation logic. |
| 2      | Overly restrictive constraints  | Solution space too limited     | Relax constraints or re-examine puzzle rules. |
| 3      | No probabilistic facts          | Not applicable                 | Add probabilistic facts if needed.          |
| 4      | Deep recursion in `all_different` | Performance issues for large lists | Optimize or replace with a more efficient method. |

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code fails to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle due to logical or arithmetic errors in `sumdigit/5` and overly restrictive constraints. Recommendations include debugging the arithmetic logic and relaxing constraints to explore a broader solution space.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
