### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch or stick with their initial selection. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, verifying its correctness and adherence to probabilistic logic.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code was tested with the following queries and results:

| Query            | Probability Result |
|------------------|--------------------|
| `prize(1)`       | 0.3333             |
| `prize(2)`       | 0.3333             |
| `prize(3)`       | 0.3333             |
| `select_door(1)` | 1.0000             |
| `win_keep`       | 0.3333             |
| `win_switch`     | 0.6667             |

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correctly distributed (1/3 each).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic (probability 1.0), as expected.
- `win_keep` (probability of winning by keeping the initial choice) is 1/3, and `win_switch` (probability of winning by switching) is 2/3, which aligns with the theoretical solution of the Monty Hall problem.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided code. The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem, including:
- Random selection of the prize door (`prize/1`).
- Host behavior when opening a door (`open_door/1`).
- Winning conditions for both strategies (`win_keep` and `win_switch`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` and the winning conditions are logically sound. For example:
  - When both unselected doors are empty, one is opened randomly (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).
  - When one unselected door has a prize, the host opens the other (`open_door(A) :- ... prize(B)`).
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly implemented and terminates for finite lists.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` and `open_door/1` comply with probabilistic rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is implicitly handled by the negation in `\+ prize(A)`.
  - The disjunction in `open_door/1` correctly models the host's behavior.

**DeepProbLog:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The rules correctly implement the Monty Hall logic.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this implementation.
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list inputs, but the code ensures valid lists (`[1,2,3]`).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue here due to small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:** The ProbLog implementation of the Monty Hall problem is correct and adheres to both classical and probabilistic logic. No errors or improvements are necessary for the given requirements.
