### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog: Error Localization and Root Cause**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, intended to sort a list recursively. The test query `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)` was executed, but an error occurred. This report analyzes the failure, identifies the root cause, and evaluates the code's compliance with ProbLog requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:14.
  ```  
- **Conclusion:** The test failed due to a syntax error in the `bubblesort/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12],X)`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Predicate:** `bubblesort/3`  
  - **Line Interval:** 4:14 (the `->` operator in the conditional statement)  
- **Actual vs. Expected:**  
  - **Actual:** Syntax error due to incorrect usage of the `->` operator.  
  - **Expected:** A correctly sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The error arises from the misuse of the `->` operator in ProbLog. Unlike Prolog, ProbLog does not support the `->` operator for conditionals. Instead, probabilistic implications or built-in predicates should be used.  
  - **Recursive Termination:** The base cases (`bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)` and `bubblesort([H], Acc, Sorted)`) are correctly defined, but the recursive case fails due to the syntax error.  

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or implications (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`), so this aspect is not applicable.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (base cases are correct, but the recursive case fails).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** The code assumes list input but does not handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
  - **Deep Recursion:** Performance may degrade for very long lists due to the recursive nature of the algorithm.  
  - **Undefined Predicates:** The `->` operator is undefined in ProbLog, causing the failure.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Misuse of `->` operator in ProbLog | Syntax error, program fails     | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible logic |
| 2   | No handling of non-list input    | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation                       |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists   | Performance issues              | Optimize or use iterative methods          |

---

#### **8. Code Correction Suggestion**  
Replace the `->` operator with ProbLog-compatible logic, such as using `if-then-else` predicates or restructuring the recursive case. For example:
```prolog
bubblesort([H1, H2 | T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    (H1 > H2 ->
        append(Acc, [H2], NewAcc),
        bubblesort([H1 | T], NewAcc, Sorted)
    ;
        append(Acc, [H1], NewAcc),
        bubblesort([H2 | T], NewAcc, Sorted)
    ).
```
Should be rewritten to avoid `->`.

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code fails due to a syntax error in ProbLog. Correcting the conditional logic and addressing edge cases will improve robustness.
