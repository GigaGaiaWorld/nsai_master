    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'append/3' at 5:6.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, which is intended to sort a list of integers. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for 'append/3' at 5:6.
  ```  
  The test failed due to the absence of a definition for the `append/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at the line where `append/3` is called (line 5).  
  - The `append/3` predicate is not defined in the provided code, leading to the failure.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The logical correctness of the `bubblesort/3` algorithm is sound, assuming `append/3` is correctly implemented.  
  - The recursive termination is correctly handled for empty and single-element lists.  
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or implications are used in this code, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

The root cause of the failure is the missing definition of `append/3`, which is a built-in predicate in standard Prolog but not automatically available in ProbLog unless explicitly defined or imported.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic of `bubblesort/3` is correct, but the missing `append/3` predicate prevents execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs or undefined `append/3`.  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be an issue for very large lists.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `append/3` predicate | Prevents execution of the code  | Define `append/3` or import it from a library. |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The `bubblesort/3` implementation is logically correct but fails due to the missing `append/3` predicate. To resolve this, either define `append/3` or ensure it is imported from a ProbLog library. The code does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features, so no further analysis is required in those contexts. Addressing the missing predicate will enable the code to function as intended.  

**Word Count:** 350 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
