### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, which is intended to sort a list of integers. The test case involves sorting the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]`. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze any failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```plaintext
  Error evaluating Problog model:
  No clauses found for 'append/3' at 5:6.
  ```  
  The test failed due to the absence of a definition for the `append/3` predicate.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - The error occurs in the `bubblesort/3` predicate, specifically at the line where `append/3` is called (line 5).  
  - The `append/3` predicate is not defined in the provided code, leading to the failure.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The logical correctness of the `bubblesort/3` algorithm is sound, assuming `append/3` is correctly implemented.  
  - The recursive termination is correctly handled for empty and single-element lists.  
- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or implications are used in this code, so no probabilistic rules are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  

The root cause of the failure is the missing definition of `append/3`, which is a built-in predicate in standard Prolog but not automatically available in ProbLog unless explicitly defined or imported.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic of `bubblesort/3` is correct, but the missing `append/3` predicate prevents execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs or undefined `append/3`.  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be an issue for very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `append/3` predicate | Prevents execution of the code  | Define `append/3` or import it from a library. |

---

### **Conclusion**  
The `bubblesort/3` implementation is logically correct but fails due to the missing `append/3` predicate. To resolve this, either define `append/3` or ensure it is imported from a ProbLog library. The code does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features, so no further analysis is required in those contexts. Addressing the missing predicate will enable the code to function as intended.
