### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, which is intended to sort a list of integers. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's classical and probabilistic reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X))` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 5:14.
```

**Failed Query:**  
- `query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X))`  
  - **Expected Result:** Sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`.  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to unsupported `->/2` operator in ProbLog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Error Location:**  
  - Line 5: `(H1 > H2 -> ...)`  
  - **Issue:** ProbLog does not support the Prolog `->/2` (if-then-else) operator.  
  - **Affected Predicate:** `bubblesort/3`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - The `->/2` operator is not part of ProbLog's syntax, causing the evaluation to fail.  
  - Recursive termination is logically correct, but the implementation cannot proceed due to the unsupported operator.  

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and unrelated to probabilistic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Not used.** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical structure is correct, but syntax is invalid).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list input or empty list handling is correct.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue for typical list sizes.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Unsupported `->/2` operator      | Code fails to execute          | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `if_then_else/3`). |
| 2      | No probabilistic facts/rules     | Limited to classical reasoning | Add probabilistic annotations if needed. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**  
Replace the `->/2` operator with a ProbLog-compatible alternative, such as:  
```prolog
bubblesort([H1, H2 | T], Acc, Sorted) :-
    (H1 > H2,
     append(Acc, [H2], NewAcc),
     bubblesort([H1 | T], NewAcc, Sorted))
    ;
    (append(Acc, [H1], NewAcc),
     bubblesort([H2 | T], NewAcc, Sorted)).
```

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code requires minor syntactic adjustments to comply with ProbLog's syntax rules. Once fixed, it should function as intended for classical list sorting.
