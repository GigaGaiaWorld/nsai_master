### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The expressions include numbers and operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The evaluation focuses on:
- Correctness of parsing and evaluation.
- Adherence to the `almost_equal` predicate for floating-point comparisons.
- Verification of recursive termination and logical correctness.
- Compliance with probabilistic rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:
  - The expected result for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` is `-13.6667`.
  - The actual result (`0.0000`) is incorrect.
- **Conclusion**: The test failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The query for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` returned `0.0000` instead of `-13.6667`.
- **Error Location**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate for division (`/`) is missing.
  - The `parse/2` predicate for multiplication (`*`) is missing.
  - The `parse/2` predicate for subtraction (`-`) is missing.
- **Code Line**: The issue lies in the incomplete implementation of the `parse/2` predicate for all four operations.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. Only the addition case (`+`) is implemented, while the other operations (`-`, `*`, `/`) are missing.
  - The recursive termination condition (`parse([N], R)`) is correct but insufficient for handling complex expressions.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code. The evaluation is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog**:
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code fails to handle all arithmetic operations.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested.
  - Division by zero is not checked.

|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `parse/2` for `-`, `*`, `/` | Incorrect evaluation of expressions | Implement `parse/2` for all operations.                                   |
| 2      | No division by zero check        | Potential runtime error        | Add a check for division by zero in the `parse/2` predicate for `/`.       |
| 3      | Non-list input not handled       | Unpredictable behavior         | Add input validation to ensure the input is a list.                        |
| 4      | Deep recursion not tested        | Potential stack overflow       | Test with deeply nested expressions and optimize recursion if necessary.   |

### **Final Conclusion**
The code fails to meet the requirements due to incomplete implementation of the `parse/2` predicate for all arithmetic operations. The test case for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` returned an incorrect result (`0.0000`). The root cause is the absence of `parse/2` rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, edge cases like division by zero and non-list inputs are not handled. 

**Recommendations**:
1. Implement `parse/2` for all operations (`-`, `*`, `/`).
2. Add input validation and edge-case handling.
3. Test with a variety of expressions to ensure correctness.
