  "ErrorSummary": "The 'almost_equal/2' predicate assumes ground terms during comparison, leading to a CallModeError when arguments are uninstantiated.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify 'almost_equal/2' to handle uninstantiated variables. For example, add a clause to check if Y is a variable before performing the comparison: 'almost_equal(X, Y) :- var(Y), Y is float(X).' Ensure this clause is placed before the ground comparison clause to avoid conflicts.",
