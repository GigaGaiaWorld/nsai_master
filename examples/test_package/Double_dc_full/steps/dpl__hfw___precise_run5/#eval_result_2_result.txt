{
  "HASH": "DA5E8955",
  "ErrorSummary": "The parse/2 predicate for addition does not handle operator precedence or nested expressions correctly, leading to incorrect evaluation of arithmetic expressions.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Revise the parse/2 predicate to account for operator precedence and parentheses. For example, implement separate predicates for each operator and ensure proper grouping of sub-expressions. Additionally, add rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division with similar precedence handling.",
