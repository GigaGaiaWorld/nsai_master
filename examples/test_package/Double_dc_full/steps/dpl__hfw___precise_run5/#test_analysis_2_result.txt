### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, ...]`). The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `parse/2` to transform these images into symbolic expressions and compute their results. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, including classical and probabilistic reasoning, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:
  ```
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:
  - The expected result for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` is `-13.6667`.
  - The actual result (`0.0000`) does not match the expected value.
  - **Conclusion**: The test fails.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect result.
- **Problematic Predicate**: The `parse/2` predicate for handling arithmetic operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) is incomplete or incorrectly implemented.
- **Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  parse([N1, +, N2 | T], R) :-
      parse([N1], R1),
      parse([N2 | T], R2),
      R is R1 + R2,
      almost_equal(R, R).
  ```
  - **Issue**: The predicate does not account for operator precedence or nested expressions (e.g., `(3 + 3)` in the denominator).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate lacks rules for handling operator precedence and parentheses. For example, the expression `2 / (3 + 3)` should be parsed as `2 / 6`, but the current implementation does not enforce this.
  - The recursive termination condition (`parse([N], R)`) is correct, but the intermediate steps for parsing operations are flawed.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
- **DeepProbLog**:
  - The code does not use neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`). **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code correctly identifies numbers and operators but fails to evaluate complex expressions due to missing precedence rules.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs or invalid images are not handled.
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is manageable for small expressions but may not scale efficiently for larger ones.
  - **Operator Precedence**: The current implementation does not account for mathematical precedence rules.

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect `parse/2` for operations | Incorrect evaluation of expressions | Implement operator precedence and parentheses handling. |
| 2   | Missing edge case handling       | Crashes for invalid inputs      | Add input validation and error handling.    |
| 3   | No probabilistic reasoning       | Limited to classical logic      | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed.  |
| 4   | No DeepProbLog integration       | No neural network support       | Use `nn/3` for neural-symbolic fusion if required. |
