</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images. The expressions include numbers and operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The evaluation focuses on:
- Correctness of parsing and evaluation.
- Adherence to the `almost_equal` predicate for floating-point comparisons.
- Verification of recursive termination and logical correctness.
- Compliance with probabilistic rules (if applicable).

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:
  - The expected result for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` is `-13.6667`.
  - The actual result (`0.0000`) is incorrect.
- **Conclusion**: The test failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: The query for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` returned `0.0000` instead of `-13.6667`.
- **Error Location**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate for division (`/`) is missing.
  - The `parse/2` predicate for multiplication (`*`) is missing.
  - The `parse/2` predicate for subtraction (`-`) is missing.
- **Code Line**: The issue lies in the incomplete implementation of the `parse/2` predicate for all four operations.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**:
  - The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. Only the addition case (`+`) is implemented, while the other operations (`-`, `*`, `/`) are missing.
  - The recursive termination condition (`parse([N], R)`) is correct but insufficient for handling complex expressions.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code. The evaluation is purely deterministic.
- **DeepProbLog**:
  - DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The code fails to handle all arithmetic operations.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested.
  - Division by zero is not checked.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `parse/2` for `-`, `*`, `/` | Incorrect evaluation of expressions | Implement `parse/2` for all operations.                                   |
| 2      | No division by zero check        | Potential runtime error        | Add a check for division by zero in the `parse/2` predicate for `/`.       |
| 3      | Non-list input not handled       | Unpredictable behavior         | Add input validation to ensure the input is a list.                        |
| 4      | Deep recursion not tested        | Potential stack overflow       | Test with deeply nested expressions and optimize recursion if necessary.   |

---

### **Final Conclusion**
The code fails to meet the requirements due to incomplete implementation of the `parse/2` predicate for all arithmetic operations. The test case for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` returned an incorrect result (`0.0000`). The root cause is the absence of `parse/2` rules for subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, edge cases like division by zero and non-list inputs are not handled. 

**Recommendations**:
1. Implement `parse/2` for all operations (`-`, `*`, `/`).
2. Add input validation and edge-case handling.
3. Test with a variety of expressions to ensure correctness. 

**Word Count**: ~450 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
