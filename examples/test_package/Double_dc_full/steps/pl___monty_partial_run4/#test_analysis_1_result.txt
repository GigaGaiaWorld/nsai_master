### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation models the problem and evaluates the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the ProbLog code.
- Ensure the probabilistic reasoning aligns with the expected outcomes.
- Identify any logical or probabilistic errors.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct (each door has an equal chance of hiding the prize).
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the theoretical outcomes (1/3 for keeping, 2/3 for switching).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- The `open_door/1` rules correctly handle the host's behavior when both unselected doors are empty or when one has a prize.
- The `win_keep` and `win_switch` predicates accurately reflect the winning conditions.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- The logical correctness of the rules is verified:
  - The `member/2` predicate ensures proper door selection.
  - The `open_door/1` rules correctly enforce the host's constraints.
- Recursive termination is ensured as the `member/2` predicate terminates when the list is exhausted.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- The probabilities comply with the rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` is implicitly handled by the negation in `\+ prize(A)`.
  - The disjunctive probabilities (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`) correctly model the host's random choice when both doors are empty.

**DeepProbLog:** DeepProbLog features are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The rules correctly model the problem's constraints.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable here.
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures valid lists (`[1,2,3]`).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to the small problem size.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation is correct and aligns with the theoretical expectations of the Monty Hall problem. No issues were identified.
