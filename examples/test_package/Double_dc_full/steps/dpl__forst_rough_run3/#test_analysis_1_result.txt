### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:  

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [3, 1, 2, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected behavior for each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test cases. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`) are logically sound. For example, `push` correctly prepends an element to the stack, and `pop` removes the top element.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `insertion_sort` predicate ensures termination by recursively processing the list until it is empty.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`). All operations are deterministic, as evidenced by the probability results of 1.0000.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The stack operations are correctly implemented and tested.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as the code is deterministic.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The `insertion_sort` predicate may face performance issues with large lists due to its recursive nature.  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable, as the code does not use expansion predicates.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input for stack | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2 | Deep recursion in `insertion_sort` | Performance bottleneck | Optimize or use a more efficient sorting algorithm. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Verdict:** The code meets the specified requirements for classical stack operations. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases like non-list inputs and deep recursion should be addressed for robustness.
