### ProbLog Merge Sort Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to the specified requirements, and ensure it handles edge cases and probabilistic scenarios appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed with the expected output. The sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` was correctly returned with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. **Length Calculation and Recursive Boundary**:  
   - The `length(List, Len)` and `Len > 1` checks ensure the list is only split if its length exceeds 1.  
2. **Splitting the List**:  
   - The `split_list/3` predicate correctly divides the list into two halves (`Left` and `Right`).  
3. **Recursive Sorting and Merging**:  
   - The recursive calls to `merge_sort/2` and the `merge/3` predicate function as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The implementation is logically correct. The recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`).  
  - The `merge/3` predicate correctly handles the merging of sorted sublists.  
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are violated.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used**: The code does not incorporate neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/…`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The merge sort algorithm is correctly implemented.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable in this case.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Empty List**: Handled by the base case `merge_sort([], [])`.  
  - **Single-Element List**: Handled by the base case `merge_sort([X], [X])`.  
  - **Non-List Input**: Not explicitly handled, but ProbLog's type system would likely raise an error.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The implementation is efficient for typical use cases, but very large lists might strain the stack due to recursion.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation is correct and adheres to the specified requirements. It handles the provided test case and edge cases like empty and single-element lists. However, explicit handling of non-list inputs and performance optimizations for very large lists could be considered for future improvements. The code does not utilize DeepProbLog features or probabilistic reasoning, so no additional checks were required in those domains.
