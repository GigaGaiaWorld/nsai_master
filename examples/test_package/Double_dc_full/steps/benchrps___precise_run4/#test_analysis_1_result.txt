### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code: Logical Correctness and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the final score. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the logical correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze test results and identify failures.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog syntax and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query provided was:
```problog
query(determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)).
```
**Result:** The test failed with the following error:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 41:77.
```

**Interpretation:** The error indicates that the ProbLog engine could not find a valid clause for the `->/2` operator, which is used in the `determine_winner` predicate. This suggests a syntax or logical error in the implementation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock,rock,rock],[paper,paper,scissor],W)`.
- **Error Location:** The error occurs in the `determine_winner` predicate, specifically at the line where the `->/2` operator is used (line 41:77).
- **Root Cause:** The `->/2` operator is not correctly implemented or is missing a valid clause. The predicate attempts to use it for conditional logic (`Score > 0 -> Winner = 'Player 1'`), but the ProbLog engine does not recognize it.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `determine_winner` predicate is intended to:
  1. Call `play/3` to compare moves and generate results.
  2. Use `compute_score/2` to calculate the total score.
  3. Determine the winner based on the score.
- **Issue:** The `->/2` operator is not a built-in ProbLog operator. Instead, ProbLog uses `if-then-else` constructs or probabilistic implications (`P(A â‡’ B)`). The current implementation does not align with ProbLog's syntax.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) are correctly implemented and terminate as expected.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The rules for `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `result/3` are correctly defined and logically sound.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not used in this implementation (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog features not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Non-list inputs are not handled (e.g., if `P1Moves` or `P2Moves` is not a list).
  - The `determine_winner` predicate fails due to incorrect syntax.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | `->/2` operator not recognized | Predicate fails | Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible conditional logic (e.g., `if-then-else`). |
| 2   | Non-list input handling missing | Potential runtime errors | Add input validation for `P1Moves` and `P2Moves`. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fixes**
1. **Replace `->/2` with ProbLog-compatible logic:**
   ```problog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
       compute_score(Results, Score),
       (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1';
        Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2';
        Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
   ```
2. **Add input validation (optional):**
   ```problog
   determine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-
       is_list(P1Moves), is_list(P2Moves),
       play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),
       compute_score(Results, Score),
       (Score > 0, Winner = 'Player 1';
        Score < 0, Winner = 'Player 2';
        Score =:= 0, Winner = 'Draw').
   ```

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
The implementation is logically sound for classical reasoning but fails due to incorrect syntax in the `determine_winner` predicate. The suggested fixes will resolve the issue and ensure compatibility with ProbLog. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this code.
