### Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including rules for determining the winner of each round and computing the overall game result. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], 'Player 2') = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The result is correct. Player 2 wins two rounds (paper beats rock, paper beats rock) and loses one (scissor loses to rock), resulting in a net score of -1 (Player 2 wins).
  - **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates `play/3`, `result/3`, and `compute_score/2` function as expected.
- **Verified Predicates:**
  - `move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3` are correctly defined and terminate properly.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog:**
  - The logical correctness of the rules is confirmed. For example:
    - `result(X, Y, win)` correctly checks if `X` beats `Y`.
    - Recursive predicates (`play/3` and `compute_score/2`) terminate as expected.
  - **Edge Cases:**
    - Empty lists are handled by `play([], [], [])` and `compute_score([], 0)`.
    - Non-list inputs would fail, but this is not a requirement for the given problem.
- **Probabilistic Context:**
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`). Thus, no probabilistic analysis is required.
  - **DeepProbLog:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes the winner.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Non-list Inputs:** The code assumes valid input lists. Invalid inputs (e.g., atoms) would cause errors.
  - **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game lengths.
  - **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates are defined and used correctly.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No issues were identified during testing.

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Tone:** Formal and concise.  

**Format:** Markdown with code blocks and tables.  

**Final Note:** The code is robust for the given problem, but additional error handling for invalid inputs could improve its reliability.
