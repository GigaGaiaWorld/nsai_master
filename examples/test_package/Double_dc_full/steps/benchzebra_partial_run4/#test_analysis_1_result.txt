### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result for the query `zebra(Houses)` is as follows:  
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```  
- **All tests passed (no failures)**: The output satisfies all the given constraints, and the probability of the solution is 1.0000, indicating certainty.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**: All predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the output adheres to the requirements specified in the `<Langda>` blocks.  
- **Verified predicates**:  
  - `my_member/2`, `right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, and `houses/1` are correctly defined and terminate recursively.  
  - No expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`) are used in this implementation.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog**:  
  - The logical constraints are correctly encoded, and the recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) terminate as expected.  
  - The solution is deterministic, as evidenced by the probability of 1.0000.  
- **Probabilistic ProbLog**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - The solution relies purely on classical logic reasoning.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used**: No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`) are present.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list input**: The `houses/1` predicate ensures the input is a list of five houses.  
  - **Recursive performance**: The recursion depth is fixed (five houses), so performance is not an issue.  
  - **Undefined predicates**: No undefined predicates are called.
