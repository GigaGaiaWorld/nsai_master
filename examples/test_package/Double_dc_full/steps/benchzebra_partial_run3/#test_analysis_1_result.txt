### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test result for the query `zebra(Houses)` is as follows:  
```prolog
zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
       house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
       house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), 
       house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
       house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
```  
- **All tests passed (no failures)**: The output satisfies all the given constraints, and the probability of the solution is 1.0000, indicating certainty.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the constraints are satisfied. The following predicates were verified:  
- `my_member/2`  
- `right_of/3`  
- `next_to/3`  
- `houses/1`  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**: The code adheres to the constraints of the puzzle. For example:  
  - The owner of the red house is English (`house(red, english, _, _, _)`).  
  - The Spanish person owns a dog (`house(_, spanish, dog, _, _)`).  
  - The middle house drinks milk (`Houses = [_, _, house(_, _, _, milk, _), _, _]`).  
- **Recursive Termination**: The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, `my_member/2`) terminate correctly as they handle base cases and recursive cases properly.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The solution has a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic reasoning. No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **DeepProbLog feature not used**: The code does not involve neural network integration or probabilistic rules beyond classical logic.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The puzzle constraints are correctly encoded and resolved.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input**: The input to predicates like `my_member/2` is always a list, as enforced by the `houses/1` predicate.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to the number of houses (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The implementation is correct and satisfies all the given constraints. No failures or issues were detected. The code is logically sound and adheres to classical ProbLog reasoning.
