### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. This evaluation analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on logical correctness, adherence to requirements, and error handling. The code provided includes constraints for house arrangements and uses predicates like `member`, `right_of`, and `next_to` to enforce the rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure during evaluation. The error message is:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    define_index = self._add_head(head)
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/clausedb.py", line 281, in _add_head
    raise AccessError("Can not overwrite built-in '%s'." % head.signature)
problog.clausedb.AccessError: Can not overwrite built-in '=/2'.
```

**Key Observations:**  
- The error occurs due to an attempt to overwrite a built-in predicate (`=/2`), which is not allowed in ProbLog.  
- No queries were successfully executed due to this error.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** The entire evaluation failed due to the `AccessError`.  
- **Root Cause:** The error stems from the ProbLog engine's restriction on overwriting built-in predicates. The issue is not localized to a specific line in the provided code but is likely related to how the ProbLog interpreter processes the input.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The constraints and predicates in the code appear logically correct for solving the Zebra Puzzle. However, the error prevents further analysis.  
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are involved.  
- **DeepProbLog:** The feature is not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The constraints are correctly defined for classical reasoning, but the error prevents execution.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The error suggests an issue with predicate handling, possibly due to an unsupported operation in ProbLog.  
  - The code does not handle non-list inputs or deep recursion, but these are not relevant here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Attempt to overwrite built-in predicate `=/2` | Execution halted | Avoid redefining built-in predicates. Check for implicit overwrites in the ProbLog interpreter. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The implementation fails due to an `AccessError` related to built-in predicate handling. While the logical structure of the puzzle constraints appears correct, the error prevents further testing. To resolve this, ensure the code does not conflict with ProbLog's built-in predicates and retest.
