### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of these failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a definition for the `member/2` predicate. The error message is as follows:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
  - **Location:** The error occurs at line 4, where the `member/2` predicate is first used.
  - **Issue:** The `member/2` predicate is not defined in the code, despite being used extensively in the constraints.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The `member/2` predicate is a built-in predicate in Prolog, but it is not automatically available in ProbLog unless explicitly defined or imported from a library. The code attempts to use `member/2` without providing its definition, leading to the error.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` predicates are correctly defined and should terminate properly for valid inputs.

- **ProbLog Probabilistic Scenario:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning is performed. The issue is purely syntactic and related to missing predicate definitions.

- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents the code from executing.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as no probabilistic facts or rules are used.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code assumes the input is a list of five houses, but it does not handle non-list inputs or malformed lists.
  - The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) are correctly defined and should handle edge cases like empty lists or invalid positions.

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate | Code cannot execute              | Define `member/2` or import it.    |
| 2      | No probabilistic reasoning   | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic facts if needed. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The primary issue in the code is the missing `member/2` predicate, which prevents the puzzle from being solved. Once this predicate is defined or imported, the code should execute correctly. The rest of the implementation adheres to the puzzle's constraints and demonstrates correct classical reasoning. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
