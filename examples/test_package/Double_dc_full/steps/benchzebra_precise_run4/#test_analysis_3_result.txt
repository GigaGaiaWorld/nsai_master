### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given constraints. This report evaluates the implementation of the puzzle in ProbLog, focusing on logical correctness, test results, and adherence to requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails during execution with the following error:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the predicate `member/2` is not defined in the ProbLog context.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Location:** Line 4 of the code.
- **Issue:** The `member/2` predicate is used in the code but is not defined in the ProbLog environment. ProbLog does not inherently support the `member/2` predicate from Prolog.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle is sound, but the implementation relies on Prolog's built-in `member/2` predicate, which is not available in ProbLog.
- **Recursive Termination:** The custom `my_member/2` predicate is defined but not used in place of `member/2`. This could lead to infinite recursion if not properly implemented.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules are violated.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The logic is correct, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `my_member/2` predicate is defined but unused.
  - Non-list inputs or deep recursion are not handled explicitly.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Code fails to execute           | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` or define `member/2` in ProbLog. |
| 2      | Unused `my_member/2` predicate   | Potential redundancy            | Use `my_member/2` consistently or remove it. |

---

#### **8. Suggested Fix**
Replace all instances of `member/2` with the custom `my_member/2` predicate or define `member/2` explicitly in ProbLog. For example:
```prolog
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
```

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  

**Conclusion:** The Zebra Puzzle implementation is logically correct but fails due to the absence of the `member/2` predicate in ProbLog. Addressing this issue will allow the code to execute as intended.
