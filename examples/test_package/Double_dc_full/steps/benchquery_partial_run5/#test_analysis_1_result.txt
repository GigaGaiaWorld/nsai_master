### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Population Density Query in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The code calculates the density for each country and compares them using specific thresholds. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the code, which correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:  
- The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density for each country.  
- The `query_pop/1` predicate accurately compares densities using the specified thresholds (`T1` and `T2`).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the code is sound. The `density/2` predicate computes the density as `(P*100)//A`, and the `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the densities of the two countries are within the specified range (`D1 > D2`, `T1 < T2`).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The code does not involve recursion, so termination is not an issue.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`). It operates purely in a deterministic context.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the logic to compare population densities.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates are used.  
- **Non-list Input:** The input to `query_pop/1` is always a list, as per the test cases.  
- **Performance:** The code is efficient and does not involve deep recursion or complex computations.
