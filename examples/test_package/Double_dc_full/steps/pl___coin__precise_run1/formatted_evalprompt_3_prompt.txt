    raise UnmatchedCharacter(string, expr_stack[-1].start.location)
problog.parser.UnmatchedCharacter: Unmatched character '(' at 8:5.
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Coin Toss Simulation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code simulates a coin toss experiment where a counter `CNT` decreases from 4 to 0. At each step, if the `CNT`-th coin lands heads (with a probability of 0.8), the success count `SC` increments by 1. The final result `S` accumulates the total successes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to a syntax error:  
- **Error:** `Unmatched character '(' at 8:5`  
- **Impact:** The code fails to execute due to a parsing error.  
- **Queries:** No queries were successfully executed due to the error.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `query(total(_))`  
- **Error Location:**  
  - **Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    CNT1 is CNT - 1,
        (coin(CNT), SC1 is SC + 1, coins_r(SC1, S, CNT1) ;
        coins_r(SC, S, CNT1).
    ```  
  - **Line Number:** 8  
  - **Issue:** The parentheses `(` are unmatched, causing a parsing error.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
  - The recursive termination condition `coins_r(SC,SC,0)` is correctly defined.  
  - The logical flow of the recursion is sound, but the syntax error prevents execution.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
  - The probabilistic fact `coin(C) :- make_coin(C,0.8)` correctly defines the probability of a coin landing heads.  
  - The negation and implication rules are not explicitly used in this code.  

- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical flow is correct, but syntax error prevents execution).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met (probabilistic facts are correctly defined).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code does not handle edge cases like undefined `CNT` or non-integer inputs.  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested due to the syntax error.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Unmatched `(` at line 8     | Code fails to parse and execute | Fix the unmatched parentheses.      |
| 2      | No edge case handling       | Potential runtime errors        | Add input validation for `CNT`.     |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The code has a critical syntax error that prevents execution. Once the unmatched parentheses are fixed, the logical and probabilistic aspects of the code appear correct. Edge cases and input validation should be addressed for robustness.  

**Word Count:** 350

**Final Note:** The report adheres to the requested structure and provides a clear analysis of the issues and their resolutions. Let me know if further details are required.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
