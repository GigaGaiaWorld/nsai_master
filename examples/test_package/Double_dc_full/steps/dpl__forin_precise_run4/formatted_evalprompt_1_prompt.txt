</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and identifying potential edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test case for the `insertion_sort/2` predicate is as follows:  
```problog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The test passes, as the output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (`insertion_sort(T, SortedTail)`).  
2. Inserts the head element `H` into the sorted list (`insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted)`).  

The auxiliary predicate `insert_element/3` is also correctly defined for all cases (empty list, insertion at the head, and insertion elsewhere).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursion terminates correctly when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], [])`). The `insert_element/3` predicate handles all insertion cases without logical errors.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, ensuring termination for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
- The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list using classical Prolog recursion and list manipulation.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause a type error.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Performance:** The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which is typical for insertion sort.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Explanation:** No errors were found in the implementation. The code meets all specified requirements and handles the provided test case correctly.

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The insertion sort implementation in ProbLog is logically correct and adheres to classical Prolog principles. While the current test case passes, additional edge cases (e.g., duplicate elements, already sorted lists) could further validate robustness. No DeepProbLog features or probabilistic reasoning are employed in this example.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
