### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, ensuring compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and identifying potential edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test case for the `insertion_sort/2` predicate is as follows:  
```problog
query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
- **Verification:** The test passes, as the output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The implementation adheres to the requirements:  
1. Recursively sorts the tail list (`insertion_sort(T, SortedTail)`).  
2. Inserts the head element `H` into the sorted list (`insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted)`).  

The auxiliary predicate `insert_element/3` is also correctly defined for all cases (empty list, insertion at the head, and insertion elsewhere).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenario:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursion terminates correctly when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], [])`). The `insert_element/3` predicate handles all insertion cases without logical errors.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, ensuring termination for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**  
- The implementation does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list using classical Prolog recursion and list manipulation.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause a type error.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Performance:** The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(nÂ²), which is typical for insertion sort.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Explanation:** No errors were found in the implementation. The code meets all specified requirements and handles the provided test case correctly.

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The insertion sort implementation in ProbLog is logically correct and adheres to classical Prolog principles. While the current test case passes, additional edge cases (e.g., duplicate elements, already sorted lists) could further validate robustness. No DeepProbLog features or probabilistic reasoning are employed in this example.
