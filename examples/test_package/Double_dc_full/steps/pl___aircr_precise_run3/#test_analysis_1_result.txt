### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap position is adjusted based on actuator strength and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within 5 time steps. The evaluation verifies the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning, logical rules, and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` (where `T` ranges from 1 to 5) are as follows:  

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but possible.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented:  
- **`goal_reached/1`**: Correctly checks if the flap position matches the goal.  
- **`overrun_exception/1`**: Correctly identifies illegal flap positions.  
- **`attempted_flap_position/2`**: Properly calculates the new position based on actuator strength and wind effects.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures no unnecessary calculations once the goal is reached.  
  - The rules for `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with probabilistic logic (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).  

- **Probabilistic Rules**:  
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect` and `use_actuator` are correctly defined and sum to 1.  
  - Negation (`\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)`) is used appropriately to trigger overrun exceptions.  

- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **Not used** in this code. No `nn/3` or `tensor` calls are present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met (e.g., `legal_flap_position/1`).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met (e.g., `wind_effect/2`).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not used in this code.  
  - **Non-list Input**: Not applicable.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.
