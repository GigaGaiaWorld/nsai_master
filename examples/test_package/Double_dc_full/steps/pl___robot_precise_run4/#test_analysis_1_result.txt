### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog and DeepProbLog Analysis**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a robot's behavior in a dynamic environment where it can pick up a key, move between locations, and handle probabilistic events like dropping the key or failing to move. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries are as follows:  
- `carrying(key, s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331`  
- `at(robot, loc2, s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot, loc1, s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot, loc0, s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key, loc2, s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key, loc1, s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key, loc0, s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the robot and key dynamics under probabilistic conditions.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts comply with the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive termination is ensured by the base case for `slippery/2` and the time-step increment `s(T)`.  
- **Negation as Failure:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is correctly applied in predicates like `carrying/2` and `drops/2`.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `fumbles_key/1` adhere to the rule `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`. For example:  
  - `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.3::pickup_fails(T)` correctly models the complement.  
- **Implications:** The rules for `drops/2` and `slippery/2` correctly compute conditional probabilities.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- **Verification:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The predicates correctly model the robot's actions and key dynamics.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic facts and rules comply with probabilistic logic.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (no DeepProbLog features used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** The code does not use undefined predicates or require `expand/2`.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable (no list operations).  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the time-step `s(T)`, ensuring termination.
