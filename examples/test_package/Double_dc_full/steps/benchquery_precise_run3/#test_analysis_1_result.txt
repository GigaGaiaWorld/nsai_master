### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations and ensures the results are within a 5% margin of each other. The evaluation verifies the correctness of the implementation and its adherence to the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results confirm that the query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities, as per the specified inequality constraints.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the expansion predicates (e.g., `pop/2`, `area/2`) are accurately defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `density/2` predicate correctly calculates the population density using integer arithmetic (`D is (P * 100) // A`).  
  - The `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that the densities of two distinct countries (`C1 \= C2`) are within a 5% margin using the inequalities `20 * D1 < 21 * D2` and `20 * D2 < 21 * D1`.  

- **Probabilistic Compliance:**  
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - The code does not use DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the query logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - The code handles all provided data correctly. However, edge cases such as zero area (division by zero) or missing data (`pop/2` or `area/2` facts) are not explicitly addressed.

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is well-implemented and meets the specified requirements. Future improvements could include handling edge cases like zero area or missing data to enhance robustness.
