### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the specified functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```problog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```problog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly follows the recursive sorting and insertion logic as specified in the requirements.  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `insertion_sort/2`: Recursively sorts the tail and inserts the head.  
  - `insert_element/3`: Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`[]`).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` ensures termination.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog recursion and insertion.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) would fail.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may impact performance, but this is inherent to the insertion sort algorithm.

|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified for the given scope.
