</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the specified functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```problog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```problog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).** The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.** The implementation correctly follows the recursive sorting and insertion logic as specified in the requirements.  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `insertion_sort/2`: Recursively sorts the tail and inserts the head.  
  - `insert_element/3`: Correctly inserts an element into a sorted list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` are logically sound. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`[]`).  
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case `insertion_sort([], [])` ensures termination.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). It is purely deterministic.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
1. **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the list using classical Prolog recursion and insertion.  
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
3. **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms, numbers) would fail.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may impact performance, but this is inherent to the insertion sort algorithm.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors or improvements are identified for the given scope.

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
