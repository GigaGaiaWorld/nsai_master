### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Digit Recognition and Addition Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines a set of `digit/2` facts representing images (`img_1` to `img_0`) and their corresponding digits (0 to 9). It also includes an `addition/3` rule to perform addition on the digits represented by two images. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic ProbLog rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```prolog
query(addition(img_5,img_6,Z)).
```  
**Result:**  
```
addition(img_5,img_6,11) = 1.0000
```  
**Verification:**  
- The query correctly returns the sum of the digits represented by `img_5` (5) and `img_6` (6), which is 11.  
- The probability of this result is 1.0000, indicating certainty.  

**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The code meets the functional requirements for classical reasoning.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. All predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the test query produces the expected result.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The `digit/2` facts are correctly defined, mapping each image to its corresponding digit.  
- The `addition/3` rule is logically correct:  
  ```prolog
  addition(X,Y,Z) :- digit(X,A), digit(Y,B), Z is A + B.
  ```  
  It retrieves the digits associated with the input images and computes their sum.  

**Probabilistic ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `0.5::digit(...)`).  
- No negations or implications are present, so rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)` are not applicable here.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly performs digit recognition and addition.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**  
1. **Undefined Inputs:**  
   - If an image not listed in `digit/2` is queried, the `addition/3` rule will fail.  
   - Suggestion: Add error handling or default cases.  
2. **Non-Integer Results:**  
   - The `addition/3` rule assumes integer inputs. Non-integer inputs would cause errors.  
3. **Performance:**  
   - The current implementation is lightweight, but recursive or large-scale operations could impact performance.

|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined inputs         | Rule fails for unknown images   | Add error handling or default cases |
| 2      | Non-integer inputs       | Potential runtime errors       | Validate input types                |
| 3      | DeepProbLog not used     | Limited to classical reasoning | Integrate neural networks if needed |

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is functionally correct for classical reasoning tasks but lacks probabilistic and DeepProbLog features. Edge cases like undefined inputs should be addressed for robustness. No failures were detected in the provided test case.
