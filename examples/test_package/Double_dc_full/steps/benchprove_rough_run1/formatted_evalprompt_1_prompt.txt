</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Meta-Interpreter and Extended Logic Processing**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Meta-Interpreter with Extended Logic Predicates**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a basic meta-interpreter for ProbLog, extended with additional logic processing predicates (`implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, and `refute/1`). The goal is to evaluate the correctness of these predicates and their integration with the meta-interpreter, as well as to analyze the test results for failures and root causes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate a failure due to an unknown clause for `->/2` (implication operator). Here are the queries and their outcomes:  

| Query | Expected Result | Actual Result |  
|-------|-----------------|---------------|  
| `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))` | Success | **Failure**: Unknown clause for `->/2` |  
| `prove(opposite(parent(carol,alice)))` | Success | Not evaluated (due to prior failure) |  
| `prove(expand(double(3),6))` | Success | Not evaluated |  
| `prove(includes([a,b,c],b))` | Success | Not evaluated |  
| `prove(extend([1,2],3,[3,1,2]))` | Success | Not evaluated |  

**Failure Summary**:  
- The first query (`implies/2`) failed due to an undefined operator `->/2` in the ProbLog context.  
- The remaining queries were not evaluated due to the initial failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `prove(implies(parent(alice,bob), ancestor(alice,bob)))`  
  - **Error Location**: Line 16, column 35.  
  - **Root Cause**: The `implies/2` predicate uses the Prolog implication operator `->`, which is not recognized in the ProbLog meta-interpreter.  
  - **Missing Definition**: The `->/2` operator is not defined in the ProbLog engine.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Context**:  
  - The `implies/2` predicate is logically correct in Prolog but fails in ProbLog due to the absence of the `->/2` operator.  
  - **Recursive Termination**: The meta-interpreter handles recursion correctly for `member/2` and `prove/1`, but the `implies/2` predicate disrupts the flow.  

- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not include probabilistic facts or rules, so probabilistic implications (`P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`) are not tested.  
  - **DeepProbLog**: No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are present. **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails on `implies/2`).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not tested (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `expand/2` rules for non-numeric inputs.  
  - Non-list inputs for `includes/2` and `extend/3` could cause errors.  
  - Deep recursion (e.g., long lists) may impact performance but was not tested.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |  
|---|---------|--------|------------|  
| 1 | Undefined `->/2` operator in `implies/2` | Breaks meta-interpreter | Replace `->` with ProbLog-compatible logic (e.g., `prove(A), prove(B)`). |  
| 2 | Missing definitions for `opposite/1`, `refute/1` | Untested functionality | Implement these predicates explicitly. |  
| 3 | No probabilistic facts/rules | Limited scope | Add probabilistic examples for comprehensive testing. |  

---

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Note**: The meta-interpreter framework is sound, but the `implies/2` predicate must be revised for ProbLog compatibility. Further testing with probabilistic and edge-case scenarios is recommended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
