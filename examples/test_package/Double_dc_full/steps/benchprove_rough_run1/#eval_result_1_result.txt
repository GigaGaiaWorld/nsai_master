  "ErrorSummary": "The `implies/2` predicate uses the Prolog `->/2` operator, which is not recognized in ProbLog, causing the meta-interpreter to fail.",
  "SuggestedFix": "Replace the `implies/2` definition with ProbLog-compatible logic. For example: `prove(implies(A, B)) :- prove(A), prove(B).` (Line 16). Also, ensure all required predicates (`opposite/1`, `refute/1`, etc.) are implemented.",
