### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Bubble Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a bubble sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements. The evaluation focuses on classical reasoning, recursive termination, and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```problog
query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```
forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The following predicates were verified:  
- `swap/3`: Correctly determines whether to swap elements based on their values.  
- `bubble/3`: Recursively processes the list to bubble the largest element to the end.  
- `bubblesort/3`: Implements the sorting algorithm by recursively calling `bubble/3` and accumulating sorted elements.  

All predicates adhere to their specified requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `swap/3` predicate correctly implements the comparison logic (`X > Y` for swapping).  
  - The `bubble/3` and `bubblesort/3` predicates ensure that the largest element is moved to the end of the list in each iteration, and the recursion terminates when the list is empty.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion in `bubblesort/3` terminates when the input list is empty, as verified by the base case `bubblesort([], L, L)`.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `P::fact` or probabilistic implications). Thus, no probabilistic analysis is required.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- The code does not include any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the bubble sort algorithm.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case in `bubblesort/3`.  
- **Performance:** The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(nÂ²), which is typical for bubble sort.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is correct for the tested case and adheres to classical ProbLog reasoning. No issues were identified. For robustness, consider adding input validation for non-list inputs.
