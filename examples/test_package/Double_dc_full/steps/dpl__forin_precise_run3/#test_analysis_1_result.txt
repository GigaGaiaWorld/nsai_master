### Code Evaluation Report: ProbLog Insertion Sort

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the specified functional requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```problog
  query(insertion_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```problog
  insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result matches the expected output, confirming that the list `[3,1,2,5,7,12]` is correctly sorted into `[1,2,3,5,7,12]` with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures Detected**:  
  The implementation correctly adheres to the requirements:  
  1. Recursively sorts the tail list.  
  2. Inserts the head element `H` into the sorted list.  
- **Edge Cases Verified**:  
  - Empty list: `insertion_sort([], [])` works as expected.  
  - Single-element list: Implicitly handled by the base case and `insert_element/3`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - **Logical Correctness**: The recursive logic of `insertion_sort/2` and `insert_element/3` is sound. The termination condition (`[]`) ensures the recursion halts.  
  - **Probabilistic Rules**: No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this implementation, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  
- **DeepProbLog Features**:  
  - **Verification**: The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts lists using classical Prolog recursion.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Performance issues for large n  | Consider iterative or optimized algorithms. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**: The implementation is correct for the given requirements and passes all tests. However, improvements can be made for robustness (input validation) and performance (optimization for large lists). No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are utilized.
