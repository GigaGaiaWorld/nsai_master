### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes for goal achievement and overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:

- **Goal Reached:**
  - `goal_reached(1) = 0.2625`
  - `goal_reached(2) = 0.1873`
  - `goal_reached(3) = 0.1269`
  - `goal_reached(4) = 0.0841`
  - `goal_reached(5) = 0.0570`

- **Overrun Exception:**
  - `overrun_exception(1) = 0.0000`
  - `overrun_exception(2) = 0.0030`
  - `overrun_exception(3) = 0.0110`
  - `overrun_exception(4) = 0.0127`
  - `overrun_exception(5) = 0.0114`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the probability of overrun exceptions remains low but non-zero.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- **`flap_position/2`:** Correctly updates the flap position if legal.
- **`overrun_exception/1`:** Correctly identifies illegal flap positions.
- **`goal_reached/1`:** Accurately checks if the goal position is achieved.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
  - The recursive termination is ensured by the `Time > 0` condition and the base case `flap_position(0,6)`.
  - Logical correctness is verified by the predicates `legal_flap_position/1`, `actuator_strength/2`, and `wind_effect/2`.

- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The probabilities of `use_actuator/2` and `wind/1` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - The `wind_effect/2` probabilities are correctly conditioned on the `wind/1` predicate.

- **DeepProbLog Features:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The system correctly models the flap movement and goal achievement.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities are correctly computed and propagated.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The system handles edge cases such as illegal flap positions (`overrun_exception/1`) and ensures termination.
  - No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.
