### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Ensure compliance with the specified requirements.
- Analyze edge cases and potential pitfalls.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query and its result are as follows:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected sorted list, and the probability is correctly reported as `1.0000`, indicating deterministic success.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation adheres to the requirements:
1. **Length Calculation and Boundary Check:**  
   - The `length(List, Len)` and `Len > 1` checks ensure recursive splitting only occurs for lists longer than 1.
2. **Recursive Sorting:**  
   - The recursive calls to `merge_sort` for `Left` and `Right` sublists are correctly implemented.
3. **Merging Sublists:**  
   - The `merge` predicate correctly combines the sorted sublists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The implementation follows the standard merge sort algorithm:
  - **Base Cases:** `merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])` handle empty and single-element lists.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates when sublists are of length 1 or less.
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs are not explicitly handled, which could lead to runtime errors.
  - Deep recursion for very large lists may cause performance issues (stack overflow).

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- The provided code does not use probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
| Requirement | Status | Explanation |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Classical Reasoning | Met | The merge sort logic is correctly implemented. |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used. |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Applicable | DeepProbLog features are absent. |

**Edge Cases and Pitfalls:**
1. **Non-list Inputs:**  
   - The code does not validate input types, which could lead to errors.
2. **Performance:**  
   - Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large lists.
3. **Undefined Predicates:**  
   - No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Non-list input handling | Runtime errors | Add input validation. |
| 2 | Deep recursion performance | Stack overflow | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |
| 3 | Probabilistic features unused | Limited functionality | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, improvements can be made to handle edge cases and optimize performance. The absence of probabilistic or DeepProbLog features limits its applicability in probabilistic scenarios.
