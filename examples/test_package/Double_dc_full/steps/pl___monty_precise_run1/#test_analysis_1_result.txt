### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle. This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, focusing on:
- Correctness of probabilistic reasoning.
- Adherence to the problem's rules (e.g., host behavior).
- Verification of test results against expected outcomes.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- All probabilities are correct:
  - The prize is equally likely behind any door (`1/3`).
  - The player initially selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
  - The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice (`win_keep`) is `1/3`.
  - The probability of winning by switching (`win_switch`) is `2/3`.

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected. The implementation adheres to the problem's requirements:
- The host opens a door randomly if two are unselected and empty (code block `E2FA63E7`).
- The host opens the only unselected empty door if one exists (code block `B4161B21`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog:**
- Logical correctness: The rules for `open_door` correctly handle the host's behavior.
- Recursive termination: The `member/2` predicate is well-defined and terminates.

**Probabilistic Reasoning:**
- Probabilities comply with rules:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`: Used in negations like `\+ prize(A)`.
  - The host's choice is fair (`0.5` probability for each door when two are empty).

**DeepProbLog:**  
DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `member/2`, `select_door/1`).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met (e.g., `prize/1`, `open_door/1`).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used.
- **Non-list input:** Not applicable (input is fixed).
- **Deep recursion:** Not an issue (limited by list length).

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Note:** The implementation is correct and aligns with the Monty Hall problem's probabilistic rules. No issues were identified.
