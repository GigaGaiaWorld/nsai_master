  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core functionality. However, edge cases (non-list input, undefined image IDs, deep recursion) are not handled.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation for lists in the `number` predicate. 2. Ensure all image IDs are defined in `digit/2`. 3. Consider an iterative implementation for long lists to avoid deep recursion.",
