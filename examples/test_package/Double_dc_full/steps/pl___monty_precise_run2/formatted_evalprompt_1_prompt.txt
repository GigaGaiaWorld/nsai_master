<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The counterintuitive result is that switching doors doubles the probability of winning (from 1/3 to 2/3).  

This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, verifying its correctness, logical structure, and adherence to probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided ProbLog code was tested with the following queries and results:  

| Query             | Probability Result |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `prize(1)`        | 0.3333             |
| `prize(2)`        | 0.3333             |
| `prize(3)`        | 0.3333             |
| `select_door(1)`  | 1.0000             |
| `win_keep`        | 0.3333             |
| `win_switch`      | 0.6667             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities for the Monty Hall problem:
- `win_keep` (staying with the initial choice) has a 1/3 probability.
- `win_switch` (switching doors) has a 2/3 probability.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem, including:
- The host's behavior when opening doors (`open_door/1`).
- The probabilistic distribution of the prize (`prize/1`).
- The outcomes for both staying (`win_keep`) and switching (`win_switch`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Logical Correctness**  
- The code ensures that the host only opens doors that are not selected and do not contain the prize.  
- The rules for `open_door/1` handle both cases where:
  1. Two doors are available for the host to choose from (randomly selected with equal probability).
  2. Only one door is available (opened with certainty).

##### **Probabilistic Correctness**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are uniformly distributed (1/3 each), as required.
- The negation and implication rules are implicitly correct:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is handled by `\+ prize(A)`.
  - The host's choice is fair when two doors are available (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).

##### **DeepProbLog**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in this implementation.  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Met? | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Yes  | The logic for door selection and host behavior is correctly implemented.    |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Yes  | The probabilities for prize distribution and host actions are accurate.     |
| Neural Network Integration | No  | Not applicable to this problem.                                            |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this implementation.  
- **Non-list input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list inputs, but the code ensures valid inputs (`[1,2,3]`).  
- **Deep recursion:** Not applicable here due to the simplicity of the problem.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | None    | N/A    | N/A        |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and robust for the Monty Hall problem. No errors or improvements are needed.

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Tone:** Formal and clear.  

**Final Note:** This evaluation confirms the correctness of the ProbLog implementation for the Monty Hall problem, demonstrating the power of probabilistic logic programming in modeling counterintuitive probability puzzles.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
