### **Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. The counterintuitive result is that switching doors doubles the probability of winning (from 1/3 to 2/3).  

This report evaluates a ProbLog implementation of the problem, verifying its correctness, logical structure, and adherence to probabilistic rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided ProbLog code was tested with the following queries and results:  

| Query             | Probability Result |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `prize(1)`        | 0.3333             |
| `prize(2)`        | 0.3333             |
| `prize(3)`        | 0.3333             |
| `select_door(1)`  | 1.0000             |
| `win_keep`        | 0.3333             |
| `win_switch`      | 0.6667             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected probabilities for the Monty Hall problem:
- `win_keep` (staying with the initial choice) has a 1/3 probability.
- `win_switch` (switching doors) has a 2/3 probability.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The implementation correctly models the Monty Hall problem, including:
- The host's behavior when opening doors (`open_door/1`).
- The probabilistic distribution of the prize (`prize/1`).
- The outcomes for both staying (`win_keep`) and switching (`win_switch`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Logical Correctness**  
- The code ensures that the host only opens doors that are not selected and do not contain the prize.  
- The rules for `open_door/1` handle both cases where:
  1. Two doors are available for the host to choose from (randomly selected with equal probability).
  2. Only one door is available (opened with certainty).

##### **Probabilistic Correctness**  
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are uniformly distributed (1/3 each), as required.
- The negation and implication rules are implicitly correct:
  - `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)` is handled by `\+ prize(A)`.
  - The host's choice is fair when two doors are available (`0.5::open_door(A) ; 0.5::open_door(B)`).

##### **DeepProbLog**  
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in this implementation.  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Met? | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Yes  | The logic for door selection and host behavior is correctly implemented.    |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Yes  | The probabilities for prize distribution and host actions are accurate.     |
| Neural Network Integration | No  | Not applicable to this problem.                                            |

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this implementation.  
- **Non-list input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list inputs, but the code ensures valid inputs (`[1,2,3]`).  
- **Deep recursion:** Not applicable here due to the simplicity of the problem.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| N/A    | None    | N/A    | N/A        |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and robust for the Monty Hall problem. No errors or improvements are needed.
