### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including the rules for determining wins, losses, and draws. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The code was tested with the following query:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
```
**Verification:**  
- The result is correct:  
  - Player 1's moves: `[rock, rock, rock]`  
  - Player 2's moves: `[paper, paper, scissor]`  
  - Expected winner: `player2` (since `paper` beats `rock` twice, and `scissor` loses to `rock` once, resulting in a net score of `-1`).  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly defined:  
- `move/1` and `beats/2` define the game's gestures and win-lose relationships.  
- `result/3` and `play/3` correctly compute the game outcomes.  
- `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3` accurately tally the results and declare the winner.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `result/3` and `play/3` are logically sound, and recursion terminates correctly with the base case `play([], [], [])`.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as empty lists and draws correctly.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `0.5::move(rock).`). Thus, no probabilistic reasoning is involved.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/...` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly implements the game's logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases and Performance:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid gestures (e.g., `move(fire)`) are not handled but are not required by the current implementation.  
- **Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, which is manageable for typical game scenarios.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors or improvements are necessary for the given scope.

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The code is robust for its intended purpose, but future extensions could include probabilistic gestures or DeepProbLog integration for more complex scenarios.
