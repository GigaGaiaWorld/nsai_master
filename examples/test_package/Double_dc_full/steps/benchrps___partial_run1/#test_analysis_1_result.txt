### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, including rules for moves, win-lose relationships, and result computation. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Expansion Predicates Verification**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so this step is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The rules for `move/1`, `beats/2`, and `result/3` are correctly defined.  
  - The recursive predicate `play/3` correctly processes lists of moves and computes results.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate accurately calculates the score based on win/lose/draw outcomes.  

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The base case `play([], [], [])` ensures termination for empty lists.  
  - The recursive case `play([P1|P1T], [P2|P2T], [R|Rs])` correctly reduces the problem size.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`), so probabilistic correctness checks are not applicable.  

##### **DeepProbLog Integration**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  **Report**: DeepProbLog feature not used.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and computes results.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Inputs**: The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., `rock`, `paper`, `scissor`). Non-list inputs or invalid moves would cause errors.  
- **Performance**: The recursive implementation is efficient for small lists but may face performance issues with very large lists due to stack usage.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The implementation is correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. No failures or probabilistic/DeepProbLog features were detected. Edge cases like invalid inputs should be handled for robustness.
