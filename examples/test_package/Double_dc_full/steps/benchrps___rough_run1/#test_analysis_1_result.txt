### Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including the rules for determining the outcome of moves and calculating the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```

**Verification**:  
- The test result is correct. The expected outcome is `player2` because:
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: `lose` (for player1)
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: `lose` (for player1)
  - `rock` vs. `scissor`: `win` (for player1)
  - Total score: `-1 + -1 + 1 = -1` (player2 wins).

**Conclusion**:  
All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided code. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the test case aligns with the expected behavior.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Analysis**:  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `beats/2` predicate correctly defines the win-lose relationships.
  - The `outcome/3` predicate accurately determines the result of a single move.
  - The `play/3` predicate recursively processes lists of moves and results.
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the cumulative score.
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate uses the score to declare the winner.

- **Recursive Termination**:  
  - The recursion in `play/3` and `compute_score/2` terminates when the input lists are empty.

**Probabilistic Analysis**:  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements**:  
- **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

**Edge Cases**:  
- **Non-list Input**: The code assumes inputs are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Empty Lists**: Handled correctly by the base cases in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.
- **Deep Recursion**: Performance is acceptable for typical game lengths but may degrade for very long lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The implementation is correct and meets the requirements for classical reasoning in ProbLog. No issues were found, and the test case validates the expected behavior. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic features or handling non-list inputs gracefully.
