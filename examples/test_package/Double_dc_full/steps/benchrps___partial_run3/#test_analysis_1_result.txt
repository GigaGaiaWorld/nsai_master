### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including the definition of moves (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`), win-lose relationships (`beats/2`), and a scoring system (`compute_score/2`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the logic, test the results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested**:  
  `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`  
  **Result**:  
  `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`  

- **Verification**:  
  The test passes as expected. The result correctly identifies `player2` as the winner because `player2` wins two rounds (`paper` beats `rock` and `paper` beats `rock`), while `player1` wins one round (`rock` beats `scissor`). The net score is negative for `player1`, confirming `player2` as the winner.

- **Conclusion**:  
  **All tests passed (no failures)**. The logic correctly handles the game rules and scoring.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- No failures were detected in the provided test case. All predicates (`move/1`, `beats/2`, `result/3`, `play/3`, `compute_score/2`, and `determine_winner/3`) function as intended.
- **Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`), so this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:  
  - The logic is sound, with correct recursive termination in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.  
  - The `result/3` predicate accurately reflects the game's win-lose-draw rules.  

- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `0.5::move(rock)`), so probabilistic correctness checks (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are not applicable.  

- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used**. No neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are present in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic and scoring.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes inputs to `play/3` and `determine_winner/3` are lists. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursion**: The recursion depth is limited by the length of the input lists, so performance is not an issue for typical game lengths.  
  - **Undefined Moves**: The code does not handle invalid moves (e.g., `move(fire)`). This could lead to unexpected behavior.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling | Potential runtime error | Add input validation for lists. |
| 2      | Undefined moves | Logical inconsistency | Extend `move/1` to reject invalid inputs. |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  

**Final Notes**: The code is logically correct for the given requirements but could be improved for robustness by handling edge cases. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
