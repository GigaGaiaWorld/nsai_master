### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors ProbLog Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, including the rules for determining wins, losses, and draws. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test result is correct. Player 2 wins because:
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.
  - `rock` vs. `paper`: Player 2 wins.
  - `rock` vs. `scissor`: Player 1 wins.
  The net score is `-1` (Player 2 wins).  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected**.  
- **Verified Predicates**:  
  - `move/1`: Correctly defines the gestures (`rock`, `paper`, `scissor`).  
  - `beats/2`: Correctly defines the win-lose relationships.  
  - `result/3`: Correctly computes draw, win, or lose.  
  - `play/3` and `compute_score/2`: Correctly handle recursion and score computation.  
  - `determine_winner/3`: Correctly determines the winner based on the score.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog**:  
  - The logic is sound, with proper termination conditions for recursion (e.g., `play([], [], [])`).  
  - No undefined predicates or infinite loops.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., no `0.5::move(rock)`).  
  - No negation or implication rules are used, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable here.  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Feature Not Used**: No neural network integration (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/...`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The code correctly implements the game logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes lists as input for `play/3` and `determine_winner/3`. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Empty Lists**: Handled correctly (`play([], [], [])`).  
  - **Deep Recursion**: No performance issues observed for small lists, but large lists could theoretically cause stack overflow (unlikely in practice for this use case).

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion**: The implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements. No errors or improvements are needed for the given scope.
