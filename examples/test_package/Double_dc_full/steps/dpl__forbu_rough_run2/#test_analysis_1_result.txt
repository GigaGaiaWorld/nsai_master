### Evaluation Report: Problog Bubblesort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Bubblesort Implementation in Problog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in Problog, intended to sort a list of integers. The goal is to evaluate the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of errors. The evaluation focuses on classical Problog reasoning, as no probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))` resulted in an error:  
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 4:12.
```

**Failed Queries:**  
- `query(forth_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X))`  
  - **Expected Result:** Sorted list `[1,2,3,5,7,12]`.  
  - **Actual Result:** Error due to unsupported `->/2` operator in Problog.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Predicate:** `bubblesort/3`  
  - **Code Line Interval:** Lines 4â€“12  
  - **Error:** The `->/2` operator (if-then-else) is not supported in Problog.  
  - **Impact:** The sorting logic cannot proceed, causing the entire query to fail.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The algorithm is logically correct for classical Prolog but fails in Problog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator.  
  - Recursive termination is correctly implemented for the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`).  

- **Probabilistic Context:**  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
  - The error is purely syntactic and unrelated to probabilistic reasoning.  

- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  - **Not used.** No neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) is present.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logically correct but syntactically invalid in Problog).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Non-list Input:** Not handled (e.g., `forth_sort(3, X)` would fail).  
  - **Performance:** Deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Unsupported `->/2` operator in Problog | Query fails | Replace `->/2` with Problog-compatible constructs (e.g., `if/3` or separate clauses). |
| 2 | No input validation for non-list inputs | Potential runtime errors | Add guards to ensure input is a list. |
| 3 | Deep recursion for large lists | Stack overflow risk | Optimize with tail recursion or iterative methods. |

**Word Count:** 450  

**Conclusion:**  
The `bubblesort/3` implementation is logically sound but fails in Problog due to the unsupported `->/2` operator. Addressing this issue and handling edge cases would make the code robust for Problog execution.
