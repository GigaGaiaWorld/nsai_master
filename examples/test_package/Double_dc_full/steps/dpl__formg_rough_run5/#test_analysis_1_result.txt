### **Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in Prolog, which is expected to sort a list of integers. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Analyze the test results.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic Prolog rules.
- Check for edge cases and potential failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The following query was tested:
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]) = 1.0000
```
**Expected Result:**
The sorted list should be `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`.

**Conclusion:**
- **Test Failed**: The output `[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]` is incorrect.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X).
```
**Actual Output:** `[1, 12, 2, 3, 5, 7]`  
**Expected Output:** `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]`

**Error Location:**
- The error lies in the `merge/3` predicate (lines 10â€“17 of the code block).
- The merging logic does not correctly handle the comparison and merging of sublists.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical Prolog Analysis:**
- The `merge/3` predicate fails to correctly merge two sorted sublists. Specifically:
  - The comparison `X @=< Y` and `X @> Y` is correct, but the recursive merging logic is flawed.
  - The merging process does not maintain the sorted order of the combined list.

**Probabilistic Analysis:**
- The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the program is deterministic (no probabilistic facts or rules are used).
- No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used.

**Edge Cases:**
- The code does not handle non-list inputs or empty lists incorrectly.
- However, the recursive termination is correct (base cases are properly defined).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (the sorting logic is incorrect).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- The code correctly handles empty lists and single-element lists.
- Non-list inputs are not explicitly checked, which could lead to runtime errors.

**Performance:**
- The recursive depth is proportional to the logarithm of the list length, which is efficient.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect merging logic          | Output list is not sorted       | Fix the `merge/3` predicate to correctly merge sublists. |
| 2   | No probabilistic features        | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed. |
| 3   | No DeepProbLog features          | No neural integration           | Consider adding neural predicates if required. |

**Code Fix for `merge/3`:**
```prolog
merge([], L, L).
merge(L, [], L).
merge([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], [X|Zs]) :-
    X =< Y,
    merge(Xs, [Y|Ys], Zs).
merge([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], [Y|Zs]) :-
    X > Y,
    merge([X|Xs], Ys, Zs).
```

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The `merge_sort/2` implementation requires correction in the merging logic to produce the correct sorted output. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases are mostly handled, but non-list inputs should be validated.
