### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog: Error Localization and Root Cause Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog, aiming to sort a list of integers. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's requirements. The test results indicate a failure, which is analyzed in detail below.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the following error:  
  ```
  CallModeError: Invalid argument types for call to 'length/2': arguments: (X1, X2), expected: (fixed_list, positive_integer) or (fixed_list, var) or (list, positive_integer) or (var, positive_integer) at 4:5.
  ```

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` failed due to an invalid call to `length/2`.  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `merge_sort/2`  
  - **Line Number**: 4 (in the `merge_sort` rule where `length(List, N)` is called).  
- **Issue**:  
  The `length/2` predicate in ProbLog expects specific argument types (e.g., a fixed list or a variable), but the call `length(List, N)` violates these expectations.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  The error arises because the `length/2` predicate in ProbLog is stricter than in standard Prolog. The current implementation assumes standard Prolog behavior, where `length/2` can handle any list or variable.  
- **ProbLog Context**:  
  ProbLog enforces stricter type-checking for built-in predicates like `length/2`. The error indicates that the arguments do not match the expected modes (e.g., `fixed_list` or `var`).  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursive logic (`merge_sort` and `merge`) is correct in terms of termination, assuming the `length/2` issue is resolved.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails due to `length/2` issue).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for very large lists.  
  - The `append/3` predicate is correctly defined but not tested in isolation.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Invalid `length/2` call in `merge_sort/2` | Prevents sorting | Replace `length(List, N)` with a ProbLog-compatible version or ensure `List` is a fixed list. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | May cause runtime errors | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` checks). |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists | Potential performance issues | Consider iterative implementations or tail recursion optimization. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation fails due to a type mismatch in the `length/2` predicate call. Addressing this issue and handling edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs) would improve robustness. The current implementation does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features.
