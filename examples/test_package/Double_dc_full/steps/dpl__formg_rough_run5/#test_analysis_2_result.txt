### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the functional requirements. The evaluation focuses on the following aspects:  
- Correctness of the merge sort algorithm.  
- Verification of test results.  
- Analysis of edge cases and potential failures.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed with the correct output and a probability of 1.0000.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation correctly sorts the input list and adheres to the expected behavior.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `merge_sort/2` predicate correctly implements the divide-and-conquer strategy of merge sort.  
  - The base cases (`merge_sort([], [])` and `merge_sort([X], [X])`) ensure termination for empty and single-element lists.  
  - The recursive splitting and merging (`split/4` and `merge/3`) are logically sound.  

- **Recursive Termination:**  
  - The recursion terminates because the `split/4` predicate ensures the list is divided into smaller sublists until the base cases are reached.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.**

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list using classical Prolog predicates.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as no probabilistic facts or rules are used.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not relevant here.  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The algorithm's performance is O(n log n), but deep recursion could lead to stack overflow for very large lists.  

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
1. Add input validation to handle non-list inputs gracefully.  
2. Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods for very large lists to avoid stack overflow.

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation for list type.         |
| 2      | Deep recursion risk         | Stack overflow for large lists  | Optimize tail recursion or use iteration.   |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical Prolog reasoning. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases and does not utilize ProbLog's probabilistic features.
