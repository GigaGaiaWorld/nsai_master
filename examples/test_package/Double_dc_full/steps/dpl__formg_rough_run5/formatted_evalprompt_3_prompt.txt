</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog: Error Localization and Root Cause Analysis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `merge_sort/2` algorithm in ProbLog, aiming to sort a list of integers. The evaluation focuses on verifying the correctness of the implementation, identifying errors, and ensuring compliance with ProbLog's requirements. The test results indicate a failure, which is analyzed in detail below.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  The test failed with the following error:  
  ```
  CallModeError: Invalid argument types for call to 'length/2': arguments: (X1, X2), expected: (fixed_list, positive_integer) or (fixed_list, var) or (list, positive_integer) or (var, positive_integer) at 4:5.
  ```

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)` failed due to an invalid call to `length/2`.  
- **Error Location**:  
  - **Predicate**: `merge_sort/2`  
  - **Line Number**: 4 (in the `merge_sort` rule where `length(List, N)` is called).  
- **Issue**:  
  The `length/2` predicate in ProbLog expects specific argument types (e.g., a fixed list or a variable), but the call `length(List, N)` violates these expectations.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical Prolog Context**:  
  The error arises because the `length/2` predicate in ProbLog is stricter than in standard Prolog. The current implementation assumes standard Prolog behavior, where `length/2` can handle any list or variable.  
- **ProbLog Context**:  
  ProbLog enforces stricter type-checking for built-in predicates like `length/2`. The error indicates that the arguments do not match the expected modes (e.g., `fixed_list` or `var`).  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The recursive logic (`merge_sort` and `merge`) is correct in terms of termination, assuming the `length/2` issue is resolved.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (fails due to `length/2` issue).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used (DeepProbLog feature not used).  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion could lead to performance issues for very large lists.  
  - The `append/3` predicate is correctly defined but not tested in isolation.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Invalid `length/2` call in `merge_sort/2` | Prevents sorting | Replace `length(List, N)` with a ProbLog-compatible version or ensure `List` is a fixed list. |
| 2   | No handling of non-list inputs | May cause runtime errors | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1` checks). |
| 3   | Deep recursion for large lists | Potential performance issues | Consider iterative implementations or tail recursion optimization. |

---

#### **8. Conclusion**  
The `merge_sort/2` implementation fails due to a type mismatch in the `length/2` predicate call. Addressing this issue and handling edge cases (e.g., non-list inputs) would improve robustness. The current implementation does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features.  

**Word Count**: ~400 words.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
