### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Population Density Query in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities (within a 5% margin). The code includes predicates for population (`pop/2`), area (`area/2`), and density calculation (`density/3`). However, the query predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined, leading to an error during execution.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Test Result**: Failure  
  - **Error**: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7`  
  - **Impact**: The query cannot be executed because the required predicate `query_pop/1` is missing.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**: `query(query_pop(_))`  
  - **Location**: Line 59  
  - **Root Cause**: The predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined in the code.  
  - **Expected Behavior**: The predicate should be defined to query pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  - The `density/3` predicate is correctly defined to calculate population density.  
  - The missing `query_pop/1` predicate is the primary issue.  
- **Probabilistic Context**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code.  
  - The error is purely syntactic (missing predicate).  
- **DeepProbLog**:  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (missing query predicate).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Undefined `query_pop/1` is the critical oversight.  
  - Non-list input or recursive performance is not relevant here.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| **Number** | **Problem**                          | **Impact**                          | **Suggestion**                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1          | Missing `query_pop/1` predicate      | Query cannot be executed            | Define `query_pop/1` to implement the query logic. |

---

### **Suggested Fix**  
To resolve the error, define the `query_pop/1` predicate as follows:

```problog
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05.
```

This predicate will find pairs of countries with population densities differing by no more than 5%.
