### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to find pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities (within a 5% margin). The code includes predicates for population (`pop/2`), area (`area/2`), and density calculation (`density/3`). However, the query predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined, leading to an error during execution.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Test Result**: The test failed with the error: `No clauses found for 'query_pop/1' at 59:7`.
- **Failed Query**: `query(query_pop(_))` could not be executed because the predicate `query_pop/1` is undefined.
- **Expected Result**: The query should return pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate**: `query_pop/1` (Line 59).
- **Root Cause**: The predicate `query_pop/1` is not defined in the code, despite being required by the task.
- **Code Block with Error**:
  ```prolog
  query(query_pop(_)).
  ```
  The error occurs because the system cannot find any clauses for `query_pop/1`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness**: The existing predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/3`) are logically correct and terminate properly.
- **Missing Predicate**: The `query_pop/1` predicate is required to fulfill the task's requirements but is missing. This predicate should:
  1. Calculate the density for each country using `density/3`.
  2. Compare densities of pairs of countries to find those within a 5% margin.
- **Probabilistic Context**: No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so probabilistic correctness is not applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The density calculation is correct, but the query functionality is incomplete.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Undefined `query_pop/1` is the primary issue.
  - Non-list input or deep recursion is not relevant here.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `query_pop/1` predicate | Query functionality fails       | Define `query_pop/1` to compare densities and return valid pairs.          |
| 2      | No probabilistic facts/rules      | Limited to classical reasoning  | Add probabilistic facts or rules if needed for more complex queries.       |

---

#### **Suggested Fix**
To resolve the issue, define the `query_pop/1` predicate as follows:
```prolog
query_pop([Country1, Density1, Country2, Density2]) :-
    density(Country1, Density1),
    density(Country2, Density2),
    Country1 \= Country2,
    abs(Density1 - Density2) / Density1 =< 0.05.
```

This predicate will:
1. Calculate densities for all countries.
2. Ensure the countries are distinct.
3. Check if their densities are within a 5% margin.

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and clear.  
**Conclusion**: The primary issue is the missing `query_pop/1` predicate. Once defined, the code should function as intended. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
