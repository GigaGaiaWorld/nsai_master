### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of these failures.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure due to the absence of a definition for the `member/2` predicate. The error message is as follows:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `zebra(Houses)` fails because the `member/2` predicate is not defined in the provided code.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** The error occurs at the first usage of `member/2` in the code (line 4).
- **Root Cause:** The `member/2` predicate is used to check if an element exists in a list, but it is not defined in the provided code. Although the code includes a `my_member/2` predicate, it is not used in place of `member/2`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented, but the failure arises due to the missing `member/2` predicate.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`, and `my_member/2`) are correctly defined and should terminate properly.
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so no probabilistic rules need to be verified.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The puzzle constraints are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents successful execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** DeepProbLog features are not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `my_member/2` predicate is defined but not used, which could lead to confusion.
  - The input to predicates like `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` assumes valid lists, but no checks are in place for non-list inputs.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `member/2` predicate     | Prevents execution of the query | Replace `member/2` with `my_member/2` or define `member/2`. |
| 2      | Unused `my_member/2` predicate   | Potential confusion             | Use `my_member/2` consistently or remove it. |

---

### **Final Remarks**
The implementation of the Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog is logically sound but fails due to the missing `member/2` predicate. Once this issue is resolved, the code should execute successfully. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so the focus should remain on classical reasoning correctness. Addressing the missing predicate and ensuring consistent use of helper predicates will resolve the current failure.
