</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Interpretable Merge Sort Algorithm in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`) for sorting lists. The goal of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards. The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** The test passed successfully.  

**All tests passed (no failures).**  
The test case demonstrates that the algorithm correctly sorts the input list, and the probability result confirms deterministic behavior (as expected in classical Prolog).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The following predicates were verified:  
- `merge_sort/2` (lines 1–7)  
- `split/3` (lines 8–10)  
- `merge/3` (lines 11–16)  
- `append/3` (lines 17–19)  

All predicates function as intended, and no errors were found in the recursive termination or logical flow.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The algorithm correctly implements the divide-and-conquer strategy of merge sort.  
  - The `split/3` predicate divides the list into two halves, and `merge/3` combines the sorted halves.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Empty list (`[]`) and single-element list (`[X]`) are handled correctly.  
  - Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers) are not explicitly handled, which could lead to runtime errors.  

##### **ProbLog Analysis**  
- The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior.  
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/…` calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Satisfied   | The algorithm correctly sorts lists using classical Prolog.                 |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Non-list Inputs:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., `merge_sort(123, X)`), which could cause errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists may lead to stack overflow (typical in Prolog).  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, making it a purely classical Prolog solution. Enhancements for input validation and performance optimization are recommended.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
