{
  "HASH": "418D2062",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core merge sort logic. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort and passes the provided test case. However, edge cases (non-list inputs, deep recursion) are not handled.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`) to handle non-list inputs. 2. Consider tail recursion or iterative methods for large lists to avoid stack overflow.",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
