### Merge Sort in ProbLog: Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic properties, and ensure compliance with the requirements of interpretability and edge-case handling.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```
**Result:**  
```prolog
merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```
**Conclusion:**  
- The test passed with the correct output and a probability of 1.0000.  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The implementation correctly handles the input list and produces the expected sorted output.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `merge_sort/2`, `split/3`, and `merge/3` are logically correct. The recursion terminates as expected for all base cases (`[]`, `[X]`) and recursive cases.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion depth is proportional to the logarithm of the input list length, ensuring efficient termination.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The test result shows a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic behavior. No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature Not Used:** The code does not include any neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements merge sort in classical Prolog.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to unexpected behavior.  
- **Empty List:** Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([], []).`.  
- **Single-element List:** Handled correctly by the base case `merge_sort([X], [X]).`.  
- **Performance:** The recursive implementation is efficient for typical use cases but may face stack overflow for extremely large lists due to Prolog's recursion limits.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled  | May cause runtime errors        | Add input validation for list types.       |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used        | Limited to classical reasoning | Extend with probabilistic facts if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is correct for classical ProbLog scenarios but lacks handling for non-list inputs and probabilistic features. Edge cases and performance considerations should be addressed for robustness.
