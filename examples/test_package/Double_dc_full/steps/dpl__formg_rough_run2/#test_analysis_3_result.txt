### Merge Sort Algorithm Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Interpretable Merge Sort Algorithm in Prolog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided Prolog code implements a merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort/2`) for sorting lists. The goal of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical structure, and ensure compliance with Prolog and ProbLog standards. The test case provided involves sorting the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query:** `merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
  - **Result:** `X = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of `1.0000`.  
- **Conclusion:** The test passed successfully.  

**All tests passed (no failures).**  
The test case demonstrates that the algorithm correctly sorts the input list, and the probability result confirms deterministic behavior (as expected in classical Prolog).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The following predicates were verified:  
- `merge_sort/2` (lines 1–7)  
- `split/3` (lines 8–10)  
- `merge/3` (lines 11–16)  
- `append/3` (lines 17–19)  

All predicates function as intended, and no errors were found in the recursive termination or logical flow.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical Prolog Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The algorithm correctly implements the divide-and-conquer strategy of merge sort.  
  - The `split/3` predicate divides the list into two halves, and `merge/3` combines the sorted halves.  
  - Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases (`[]` and `[X]`).  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Empty list (`[]`) and single-element list (`[X]`) are handled correctly.  
  - Non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers) are not explicitly handled, which could lead to runtime errors.  

##### **ProbLog Analysis**  
- The test result shows a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic behavior.  
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this implementation.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used (no `nn/3` or `tensor/…` calls).

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Satisfied   | The algorithm correctly sorts lists using classical Prolog.                 |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules are used.                                   |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features are employed.                                       |

##### **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**  
- **Non-list Inputs:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., `merge_sort(123, X)`), which could cause errors.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for very large lists may lead to stack overflow (typical in Prolog).  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`).  |
| 2      | Deep recursion           | Stack overflow for large lists  | Optimize tail recursion or use iterative methods. |

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The merge sort implementation is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, making it a purely classical Prolog solution. Enhancements for input validation and performance optimization are recommended.
