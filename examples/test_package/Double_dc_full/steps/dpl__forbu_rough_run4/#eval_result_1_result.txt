{
  "HASH": "47D659C8",
  "ErrorSummary": "The bubblesort implementation does not correctly sort the input list due to arbitrary swapping in swap/5 and lack of sorting logic in bubble/3. The accumulator in bubblesort/3 is also incorrectly built.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Replace swap/5 with deterministic comparison (e.g., H1 =< H2). 2. Modify bubble/3 to enforce sorting conditions. 3. Correct the accumulator handling in bubblesort/3 to build the sorted list properly. 4. Add input validation for edge cases.",
