### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller with Error Diagnosis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within 5 time steps. The code includes probabilistic facts (e.g., actuator selection, wind strength) and deterministic rules (e.g., flap movement logic). The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Diagnose the `UnknownClause` error encountered during testing.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Error Encountered**: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 33:208`.
- **Queries**:
  - `query(goal_reached(T))`: Not executed due to the error.
  - `query(overrun_exception(T))`: Not executed due to the error.
- **Outcome**: All tests failed due to the `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location**: Line 33, column 208.
- **Affected Predicate**: The error suggests a missing or malformed clause for the `->/2` operator (implication).
- **Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time-1,
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
    goal(Target),
    Delta is Target - PrevPos,
    ( Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1 ),
    Move is Direction * Strength + WindEffect,
    Pos is PrevPos + Move.
  ```
- **Issue**: The `->/2` operator is syntactically correct, but the error indicates a deeper problem, likely related to clause grounding or undefined predicates.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog**:
  - The `->/2` operator is valid in Prolog/ProbLog, but the error suggests the interpreter failed to ground the clause.
  - Possible causes:
    1. **Undefined Predicate**: A predicate used in the clause (e.g., `goal/1`, `flap_position/2`) might not be defined or is misspelled.
    2. **Grounding Issue**: The clause may not be grounded due to uninstantiated variables (e.g., `Time`, `PrevPos`).
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - The probabilistic facts (`wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`) are correctly defined.
  - The negation (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic for flap movement is sound, but the error prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly implemented for actuator selection and wind effects.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Predicates**: Ensure all predicates (e.g., `goal/1`) are defined.
  - **Non-List Input**: Not relevant here.
  - **Recursive Performance**: The recursion in `attempted_flap_position/2` is well-bounded by `Time > 0`.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | `UnknownClause` for `->/2` | Execution halted | Verify all predicates are defined and variables are instantiated. |
| 2 | Unverified grounding of `attempted_flap_position/2` | Incorrect results | Add debug prints to trace variable instantiation. |
| 3 | Missing test results | No validation | Fix the error and re-run queries. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Debugging**:
   - Add `write` statements to trace variable values in `attempted_flap_position/2`.
   - Check for typos in predicate names (e.g., `goal` vs. `goal_reached`).
2. **Testing**:
   - After fixing the error, validate the queries:
     ```prolog
     query(goal_reached(T)) :- at(S), between(1,S,T).
     query(overrun_exception(T)) :- at(S), between(1,S,T).
     ```
3. **Documentation**:
   - Clarify the purpose of `at(5)` and ensure it aligns with the time steps.
