<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller with Error Diagnosis**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, simulating the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position `6` to `4` within 5 time steps. The code includes probabilistic facts (e.g., actuator selection, wind strength) and deterministic rules (e.g., flap movement logic). The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation.
- Diagnose the `UnknownClause` error encountered during testing.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Error Encountered**: `UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 33:208`.
- **Queries**:
  - `query(goal_reached(T))`: Not executed due to the error.
  - `query(overrun_exception(T))`: Not executed due to the error.
- **Outcome**: All tests failed due to the `UnknownClause` error.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Error Location**: Line 33, column 208.
- **Affected Predicate**: The error suggests a missing or malformed clause for the `->/2` operator (implication).
- **Code Block**:
  ```prolog
  attempted_flap_position(Time,Pos) :-
    Time > 0,
    Prev is Time-1,
    flap_position(Prev, PrevPos),
    \+ goal_reached(Prev),
    use_actuator(Time, Actuator),
    actuator_strength(Actuator, Strength),
    wind_effect(Time, WindEffect),
    goal(Target),
    Delta is Target - PrevPos,
    ( Delta > 0 -> Direction = 1 ; Direction = -1 ),
    Move is Direction * Strength + WindEffect,
    Pos is PrevPos + Move.
  ```
- **Issue**: The `->/2` operator is syntactically correct, but the error indicates a deeper problem, likely related to clause grounding or undefined predicates.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog**:
  - The `->/2` operator is valid in Prolog/ProbLog, but the error suggests the interpreter failed to ground the clause.
  - Possible causes:
    1. **Undefined Predicate**: A predicate used in the clause (e.g., `goal/1`, `flap_position/2`) might not be defined or is misspelled.
    2. **Grounding Issue**: The clause may not be grounded due to uninstantiated variables (e.g., `Time`, `PrevPos`).
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - The probabilistic facts (`wind_effect/2`, `use_actuator/2`) are correctly defined.
  - The negation (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) complies with `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The logic for flap movement is sound, but the error prevents execution.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Correctly implemented for actuator selection and wind effects.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Predicates**: Ensure all predicates (e.g., `goal/1`) are defined.
  - **Non-List Input**: Not relevant here.
  - **Recursive Performance**: The recursion in `attempted_flap_position/2` is well-bounded by `Time > 0`.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| # | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | `UnknownClause` for `->/2` | Execution halted | Verify all predicates are defined and variables are instantiated. |
| 2 | Unverified grounding of `attempted_flap_position/2` | Incorrect results | Add debug prints to trace variable instantiation. |
| 3 | Missing test results | No validation | Fix the error and re-run queries. |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Debugging**:
   - Add `write` statements to trace variable values in `attempted_flap_position/2`.
   - Check for typos in predicate names (e.g., `goal` vs. `goal_reached`).
2. **Testing**:
   - After fixing the error, validate the queries:
     ```prolog
     query(goal_reached(T)) :- at(S), between(1,S,T).
     query(overrun_exception(T)) :- at(S), between(1,S,T).
     ```
3. **Documentation**:
   - Clarify the purpose of `at(5)` and ensure it aligns with the time steps.

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Format**: Markdown with code blocks and tables.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
