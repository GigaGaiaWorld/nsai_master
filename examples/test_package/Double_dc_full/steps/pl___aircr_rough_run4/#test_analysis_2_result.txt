### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, where the flap's position is adjusted based on actuator strength, wind effects, and a target goal. The system is probabilistic, accounting for uncertainties in actuator selection and wind conditions. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the test results.
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.
- Ensure compliance with functional requirements and edge cases.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:

| Query                 | Probability |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`     | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`     | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`     | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`     | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`     | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)`| 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)`| 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)`| 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)`| 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)`| 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, given the probabilistic nature of actuator selection and wind effects.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:
- `attempted_flap_position/2`: Correctly calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and target.
- `flap_position/2` and `overrun_exception/1`: Properly handle legal and illegal flap positions.
- Probabilistic facts (`use_actuator/2`, `wind/1`, `wind_effect/2`): Comply with probabilistic rules.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic in `attempted_flap_position/2` ensures termination by decrementing `Time` and checking `goal_reached/1`.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilities of `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` adhere to `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)` and `P(A⇒B) = P(¬A) + P(A∧B)`.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The system correctly handles deterministic rules like `legal_flap_position/1`.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. Probabilities are correctly computed and propagated.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined `expand/2`: Not used.
  - Non-list input: Not applicable.
  - Deep recursion: Limited to 5 steps, so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 350 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is logically and probabilistically sound, meeting all specified requirements. No edge cases or failures were identified. The absence of DeepProbLog features is noted.
