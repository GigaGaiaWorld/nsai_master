### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, where the flap's position is adjusted based on actuator strength and wind effects. The goal is to move the flap from position 6 to 4 within 5 time steps. The evaluation aims to:
- Verify the correctness of the probabilistic reasoning.
- Ensure the logical flow adheres to the requirements.
- Analyze edge cases and potential failures.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` are as follows:

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities decrease over time for `goal_reached(T)`, which aligns with the increasing uncertainty of reaching the goal as time progresses. The `overrun_exception(T)` probabilities are minimal, indicating rare illegal flap positions.

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the logic adheres to the requirements.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The recursive logic in `attempted_flap_position/2` correctly calculates the new position based on the previous position, actuator strength, and wind effect. The termination condition (`goal_reached/1`) ensures the recursion stops when the goal is achieved.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The probabilities for `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). The distribution of wind effects is correctly modeled for weak and strong winds.
- **DeepProbLog:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`). Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The logic for flap movement and goal checking is sound.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly implemented.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the code.
  - **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic reasoning is correctly implemented, and the test results confirm the absence of failures. No DeepProbLog features are used, and edge cases are appropriately handled.
