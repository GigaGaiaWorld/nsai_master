### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort Implementation

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Insertion Sort Implementation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The purpose of this report is to evaluate the correctness and robustness of a ProbLog implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The code recursively sorts a list by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sublist. The evaluation focuses on verifying test results, logical correctness, and adherence to ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The provided test case and its result are as follows:  
- **Query:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)`  
- **Result:** `insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  
  The test case correctly sorts the input list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]` into `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` with a probability of 1.0000, indicating deterministic correctness.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the provided test case. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented as follows:  
- **Predicate:** `insertion_sort/2`  
  - Recursively sorts the tail of the list (`insertion_sort(T, SortedTail)`).  
  - Inserts the head element into the sorted tail (`insert_element(H, SortedTail, Sorted)`).  
- **Predicate:** `insert_element/3`  
  - Correctly handles insertion of an element into an empty list (`insert_element(X, [], [X])`).  
  - Places the element in the correct position based on comparison (`X =< H` or `X > H`).  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The implementation adheres to the classical insertion sort algorithm. The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], [])`), and the `insert_element/3` predicate ensures correct placement of elements.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion depth is proportional to the length of the input list, ensuring termination for finite lists.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The test case does not involve probabilistic facts or negations. The result is deterministic (`1.0000`), so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  

**DeepProbLog Features:**  
- **DeepProbLog feature not used.**  
  The code does not involve neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The implementation correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this test case.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Non-list Input:** The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Empty List:** Correctly handled by the base case `insertion_sort([], [])`.  
- **Performance:** Deep recursion for large lists may cause stack overflow, but this is inherent to the algorithm.

| Number | Problem                     | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input not handled  | Runtime error for invalid input | Add input validation (e.g., `is_list/1`). |
| 2      | Deep recursion for large lists | Potential stack overflow       | Consider iterative approaches for large datasets. |

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct for the given test case and adheres to classical ProbLog reasoning. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this example.
