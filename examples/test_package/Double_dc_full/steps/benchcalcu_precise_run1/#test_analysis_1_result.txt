### Cryptoaddition Puzzle Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` must hold under the following constraints:  
1. Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9).  
2. The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
3. The addition must account for carry-over.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to:  
- Verify the correctness of the test results.  
- Analyze the logical and probabilistic soundness of the code.  
- Ensure compliance with the requirements.  

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided are as follows:  
```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). Each query returns a probability of `1.0000`, indicating that the constraints are satisfied for these inputs.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates were verified:  
- `digit/1` and `leftdigit/1`: Correctly enforce digit constraints.  
- `all_different/1`: Ensures uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly handles addition with carry-over.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Analysis:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `sumdigit/5` correctly models column addition with carry-over.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates as the list shrinks with each recursive call.  

**Probabilistic Analysis:**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are violated.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs (0-9). Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The recursion depth is limited by the number of digits (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:**  
The code is correct and meets all specified requirements. No failures or edge cases were identified. The absence of probabilistic or DeepProbLog features is noted but not a concern for this classical puzzle.
