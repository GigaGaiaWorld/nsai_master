### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Key Pickup and Robot Movement**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot picks up a key and moves between locations. The code includes probabilistic facts and rules to simulate the success or failure of actions like picking up the key or moving the robot. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure it meets the functional requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5898`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the probabilistic model, and no discrepancies were found.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the probabilistic facts are properly integrated.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- The recursive predicates (e.g., `carrying/2`, `slippery/2`) terminate correctly as they are grounded by the base cases (e.g., `initially_slippery(key)`).  
- The logical correctness of the rules is verified. For example, the `carrying/2` predicate correctly models the conditions for picking up and holding the key.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The computation of probabilities adheres to the rules of probability theory. For example:  
  - `P(¬drops(key,T)) = 1 - P(drops(key,T))` is correctly handled by the negation-as-failure (`\+`).  
  - The probabilistic facts (e.g., `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T)`) are correctly combined with the rules to compute the final probabilities.  

**DeepProbLog:**  
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The code correctly models the robot's actions and the key's state.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities are correctly computed and integrated into the model.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

**Edge Cases:**  
- The code handles edge cases such as the robot failing to move (`goto_fails(T)`) or the key being slippery (`slippery(key,T)`).  
- No undefined predicates or non-list inputs are present.  
- The recursive depth is manageable for the given scenario.
