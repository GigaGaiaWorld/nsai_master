    insertion_sort(Tail, SortedTail),
    insert(Head, SortedTail, Sorted).

<Result>
 Here are the testing result of code:
 % Problog Inference Result：
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12],[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Code Evaluation Report: Insertion Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of `insertion_sort/2` in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its behavior in both classical and probabilistic contexts, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following query was tested:  
```prolog
query(insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
```  
**Result:**  
```prolog
insertion_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
```  
**Conclusion:**  
- **All tests passed (no failures).**  
  The query returned the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000, indicating perfect logical correctness for the given input.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
  The code correctly implements the `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` predicates. All rules are logically sound, and the recursion terminates as expected.  
- **Expansion Predicates:**  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so this section is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  The `insertion_sort/2` predicate recursively splits the input list, sorts the tail, and inserts the head into the sorted tail using `insert/3`. The `insert/3` predicate handles the insertion logic correctly, ensuring the list is sorted.  
- **Recursive Termination:**  
  The recursion terminates when the input list is empty (`insertion_sort([], []).`), which is the base case.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:**  
  The code does not include any DeepProbLog-related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:**  
  The requirement for an interpretable `insertion_sort/2` algorithm is fully met. The code correctly sorts the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:**  
  Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic features.  
- **Neural Network Integration:**  
  Not applicable.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input:**  
  The code does not handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance:**  
  The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which may be inefficient for large lists.  
- **Undefined Predicates:**  
  No undefined predicates are used in the code.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Runtime errors for invalid input | Add input validation checks.        |
| 2      | Performance for large lists | Inefficient sorting           | Consider alternative algorithms (e.g., quicksort). |

---

**Word Count:** ~400 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The `insertion_sort/2` implementation is logically correct and meets the specified requirements for classical reasoning. However, it lacks robustness for edge cases like non-list inputs and may not scale well for large datasets. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
