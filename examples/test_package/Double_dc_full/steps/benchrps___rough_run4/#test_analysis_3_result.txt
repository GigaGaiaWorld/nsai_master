### Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a function to determine the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test query and its results are as follows:  
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```
**Results:**  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], draw) = 1.0000`  
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player1) = 1.0000`  

**Verification:**  
- The results are contradictory because the probabilities for all outcomes (`player1`, `player2`, `draw`) sum to more than 1.0000, which violates probabilistic rules.  
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to incorrect probability computation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query:** `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)`  
  - **Expected:** Only one outcome should have a probability of 1.0000 (e.g., `player2`).  
  - **Actual:** All outcomes are assigned a probability of 1.0000.  

- **Faulty Predicate:** `compute_score/2` and `determine_winner/3`  
  - **Code Block:**  
    ```prolog
    compute_score([], 0).
    compute_score([win | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 + 1.
    compute_score([lose | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1 - 1.
    compute_score([draw | Rs], S) :- compute_score(Rs, S1), S is S1.
    ```
  - **Issue:** The `determine_winner/3` predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes, leading to incorrect probability assignments.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The `play_round/3` and `play/3` predicates correctly implement the game rules.  
  - The `compute_score/2` predicate correctly calculates the score but does not handle probabilistic constraints.  

- **Probabilistic Rules Violation:**  
  - The `determine_winner/3` predicate assigns probabilities independently, violating the rule that probabilities of mutually exclusive outcomes must sum to 1.  

- **DeepProbLog Feature:**  
  - **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met (rules and scoring are correctly implemented).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met (incorrect probability computation).  
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.  

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion is not an issue here due to limited input size.
