  "ErrorSummary": "Incorrect probability assignment in determine_winner/3 predicate, leading to non-mutually exclusive outcomes with probabilities summing >1.0000",
  "SuggestedFix": "Modify determine_winner/3 to enforce mutual exclusivity by replacing the disjunction (;) with probabilistic choice (e.g., using ProbLog's built-in probabilistic predicates or ensuring only one outcome is possible per score). Example fix:\n\ndetermine_winner(P1Moves, P2Moves, Winner) :-\n  play(P1Moves, P2Moves, Results),\n  compute_score(Results, S),\n  (S > 0 -> Winner = player1\n  ; S < 0 -> Winner = player2\n  ; Winner = draw).",
