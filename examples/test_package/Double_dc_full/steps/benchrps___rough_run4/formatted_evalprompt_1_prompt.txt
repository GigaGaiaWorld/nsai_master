</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a scoring system to determine the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game logic and scoring mechanism.
- Analyze the test results for discrepancies.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules in ProbLog.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query is:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```

**Test Results:**
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], draw) = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player1) = 1.0000`

**Analysis:**
- The results are contradictory because the probabilities for `player2`, `draw`, and `player1` all sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0.
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to incorrect probability distribution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
- All three results for `determine_winner/3` are incorrect because they violate the probabilistic constraint.

**Problematic Predicate:**
- The `play_round/3` predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes (`win`, `lose`, `draw`). This leads to overlapping probabilities in the results.

**Code Block:**
```prolog
play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :-
    beats(P1Move, P2Move), Result = win ;
    beats(P2Move, P1Move), Result = lose ;
    Result = draw.
```

**Issue:**
- The predicate allows multiple outcomes to be true simultaneously, which is incorrect for a deterministic game like rock-paper-scissors.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
- The logical correctness of the `play_round/3` predicate is flawed because it does not ensure that only one outcome is possible for a given pair of moves.
- Recursive termination is correct in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.

**Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**
- The results violate the rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. This is due to the non-exclusive definition of `play_round/3`.

**DeepProbLog Feature:**
- Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The game logic is correct, but the predicate `play_round/3` is flawed.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to incorrect probability distribution.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- Non-list inputs are not handled.
- Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Overlapping outcomes in `play_round/3` | Incorrect probability distribution | Redefine `play_round/3` to ensure mutual exclusivity of outcomes.          |
| 2   | Probabilities sum to >1.0        | Violates probabilistic rules     | Ensure the sum of probabilities for mutually exclusive outcomes is 1.0.    |
| 3   | No input validation              | Potential runtime errors         | Add checks for non-list inputs or invalid moves.                           |

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The code requires revision to enforce mutual exclusivity in `play_round/3` and ensure correct probability distribution. No DeepProbLog features are used.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
