### **Evaluation Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Logic in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code defines the rules of the rock-paper-scissors game and implements a scoring system to determine the winner of a series of moves. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the game logic and scoring mechanism.
- Analyze the test results for discrepancies.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules in ProbLog.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test query is:
```prolog
query(determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], W)).
```

**Test Results:**
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player2) = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], draw) = 1.0000`
- `determine_winner([rock, rock, rock], [paper, paper, scissor], player1) = 1.0000`

**Analysis:**
- The results are contradictory because the probabilities for `player2`, `draw`, and `player1` all sum to 3.0, which violates the probabilistic rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0.
- **Conclusion:** The test fails due to incorrect probability distribution.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
**Failed Query:**
- All three results for `determine_winner/3` are incorrect because they violate the probabilistic constraint.

**Problematic Predicate:**
- The `play_round/3` predicate does not enforce mutual exclusivity of outcomes (`win`, `lose`, `draw`). This leads to overlapping probabilities in the results.

**Code Block:**
```prolog
play_round(P1Move, P2Move, Result) :-
    beats(P1Move, P2Move), Result = win ;
    beats(P2Move, P1Move), Result = lose ;
    Result = draw.
```

**Issue:**
- The predicate allows multiple outcomes to be true simultaneously, which is incorrect for a deterministic game like rock-paper-scissors.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
- The logical correctness of the `play_round/3` predicate is flawed because it does not ensure that only one outcome is possible for a given pair of moves.
- Recursive termination is correct in `play/3` and `compute_score/2`.

**Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**
- The results violate the rule that probabilities must sum to 1.0. This is due to the non-exclusive definition of `play_round/3`.

**DeepProbLog Feature:**
- Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The game logic is correct, but the predicate `play_round/3` is flawed.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not met due to incorrect probability distribution.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**
- Non-list inputs are not handled.
- Deep recursion is not an issue here due to the small input size.

|-----|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Overlapping outcomes in `play_round/3` | Incorrect probability distribution | Redefine `play_round/3` to ensure mutual exclusivity of outcomes.          |
| 2   | Probabilities sum to >1.0        | Violates probabilistic rules     | Ensure the sum of probabilities for mutually exclusive outcomes is 1.0.    |
| 3   | No input validation              | Potential runtime errors         | Add checks for non-list inputs or invalid moves.                           |

**Final Note:** The code requires revision to enforce mutual exclusivity in `play_round/3` and ensure correct probability distribution. No DeepProbLog features are used.
