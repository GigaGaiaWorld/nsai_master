</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation models the problem and evaluates the probabilities of winning under the "keep" and "switch" strategies.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the ProbLog code.
- Ensure the probabilistic reasoning aligns with the expected outcomes of the Monty Hall problem.
- Identify any logical or probabilistic errors in the implementation.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results from the ProbLog inference are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Verification:**
- The probabilities for `prize/1` are correct, as each door has an equal chance of hiding the prize.
- `select_door(1)` is deterministic, as expected.
- `win_keep` and `win_switch` probabilities match the theoretical outcomes of the Monty Hall problem (1/3 for keeping, 2/3 for switching).

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. All queries returned the expected probabilities. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented to reflect the Monty Hall problem's logic.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- The logical correctness of the rules is verified:
  - `open_door/1` correctly handles the cases where the host opens a door without a prize.
  - `win_keep` and `win_switch` accurately model the winning conditions.
- Recursive termination is ensured in the `member/2` predicate, as it correctly traverses the list of doors.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined with equal probabilities.
- The negation and implication rules comply with probabilistic principles:
  - `\+ prize(A)` correctly computes the probability of a door not having a prize.
  - The host's behavior (`open_door/1`) adheres to the problem's constraints.

**DeepProbLog Features:**
- DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this implementation. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The rules correctly model the Monty Hall problem.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- The `member/2` predicate handles non-list inputs gracefully by failing, which is acceptable in this context.
- No deep recursion or performance issues are present due to the small problem size (3 doors).
- The `expand/2` predicate is not used, so no undefined behavior is introduced.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all requirements for the Monty Hall problem. No errors or improvements are suggested.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
