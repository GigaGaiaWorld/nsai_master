### Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Aircraft Flap Controller ProbLog Code and Test Results**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under the influence of actuators and wind effects, with probabilistic outcomes. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze the test results, and ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results include the following queries and their probabilities:  

| Query               | Probability |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625      |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873      |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269      |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841      |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570      |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000      |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030      |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110      |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127      |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114      |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions are rare but increase slightly as time progresses.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the expansion predicates (e.g., `legal_flap_position/1`, `use_actuator/2`, `wind_effect/2`) are consistent with both classical and probabilistic contexts.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `flap_position/2`, `overrun_exception/1`, and `goal_reached/1` are logically sound. For example, `flap_position/2` ensures the flap moves only to legal positions, and `overrun_exception/1` correctly identifies illegal positions.
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursion in `attempted_flap_position/2` terminates as the time steps are bounded by `at(5)`.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `wind/1` and `wind_effect/2` comply with the rules of probability (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`). For instance, `wind(weak)` and `wind(strong)` are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
- **Negations/Implications:** The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled, and the implications in the rules are consistent with probabilistic logic.

**DeepProbLog:**  
- **Feature Usage:** DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are not used in this code.  
**Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The system correctly models the flap movement and exceptions.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules are correctly implemented.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable in this context.
- **Non-list Input:** The input is well-defined (e.g., integers for positions).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, avoiding performance issues.
