```report
{"HASH": "35747D5A", "ErrorSummary": "No issues found", "SuggestedFix": "None needed", "Dependencies": [], "NeedRegenerate": false}
``` 

### Explanation:
- **HASH**: Matches the provided code block identifier (`35747D5A`).  
- **ErrorSummary**: No errors detected. The code correctly implements the cryptoaddition puzzle constraints (`AB + BCD = CDE`) using ProbLog predicates.  
- **SuggestedFix**: Not applicable (code is correct).  
- **Dependencies**: None (the module is self-contained).  
- **NeedRegenerate**: `false` (the code is functionally correct and passes all tests).  

### Additional Notes:
- The test results confirm the code produces valid solutions (e.g., `47 + 782 = 829`).  
- All constraints (unique digits, no leading zeros, column-wise addition with carry) are enforced.  
- No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used, so no additional checks are required.
