#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of the Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where the goal is to find unique digits for the variables `A, B, C, D, E` such that the equation `AB + BCD = CDE` holds. The code uses predicates like `digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, `all_different/1`, and `sumdigit/5` to enforce constraints and simulate column-wise addition. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`. All solutions are valid and satisfy the constraints of the puzzle. Here are the results:

```prolog
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 2, 9]) = 1.0000
query_sum([4, 7, 8, 3, 0]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 6, 7, 2, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([5, 7, 8, 4, 1]) = 1.0000
query_sum([6, 7, 8, 5, 2]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 4, 5, 2, 6]) = 1.0000
query_sum([7, 5, 6, 3, 8]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 3, 4, 2, 5]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 4, 5, 3, 7]) = 1.0000
query_sum([8, 5, 6, 4, 9]) = 1.0000
```

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results are consistent with the constraints and logic of the puzzle.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
Since all tests passed, there are no failures to localize. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, and the constraints are enforced as expected.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates `digit/1`, `leftdigit/1`, and `all_different/1` ensure that the digits are unique and that multi-digit numbers do not start with zero. The `sumdigit/5` predicate correctly simulates column-wise addition with carry.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different/1` predicate terminates correctly for both empty and non-empty lists.
- **Probabilistic Compliance:** The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated. The results are deterministic (probability 1.0000).
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used in the code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The code correctly solves the cryptoaddition puzzle using classical Prolog constraints.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable, as the problem is deterministic.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used. The report confirms: "DeepProbLog feature not used."
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The `all_different/1` predicate handles lists correctly, including edge cases like empty lists.
  - The `leftdigit/1` predicate ensures no leading zeros.
  - No performance issues were observed, as the problem size is small.
