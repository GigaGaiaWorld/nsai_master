### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report: Monty Hall Problem

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Implementation for the Monty Hall Problem**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle where a contestant selects one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing no prize, and offers the contestant the choice to switch doors. This ProbLog implementation models the problem and evaluates the probabilities of winning by keeping or switching the initial choice.

The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the ProbLog code.
- Ensure the probabilistic reasoning aligns with the expected outcomes.
- Identify any logical or probabilistic errors.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:
- `prize(1) = 0.3333`
- `prize(2) = 0.3333`
- `prize(3) = 0.3333`
- `select_door(1) = 1.0000`
- `win_keep = 0.3333`
- `win_switch = 0.6667`

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results match the expected probabilities:
- The prize is equally likely behind any of the three doors (`prize/1`).
- The contestant always selects door 1 (`select_door(1)`).
- The probability of winning by keeping the initial choice is 1/3 (`win_keep`).
- The probability of winning by switching is 2/3 (`win_switch`).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. All predicates and rules function as intended:
- The probabilistic facts (`prize/1`) are correctly defined.
- The rules for `open_door/1` handle both cases (two empty doors and one empty door) as specified.
- The `win_keep` and `win_switch` predicates correctly compute the probabilities.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `open_door/1` and `win_switch` are logically sound. The use of negation (`\+`) ensures that only valid doors are considered.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `member/2` predicate is correctly implemented and terminates for finite lists.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `prize/1` sum to 1, as required.
- **Negation/Implication:** The negation of `prize(A)` and `select_door(A)` in the `open_door/1` rules adheres to `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`.
- **DeepProbLog:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The rules correctly model the Monty Hall problem.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilities align with theoretical expectations.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in this implementation.
- **Non-list Input:** The `member/2` predicate assumes list input, but the code ensures valid lists (`[1,2,3]`).
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** Not an issue due to small input size.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct and meets all specified requirements. No errors or improvements are needed.  

**Word Count:** 450 words.

**Final Note:** This report confirms the correctness of the ProbLog code for the Monty Hall problem. The results align with theoretical probabilities, and no issues were identified.
