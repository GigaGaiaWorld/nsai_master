### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's syntax and semantics.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Executed:** `zebra(Houses)`  
- **Result:**  
  ```prolog
  zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), 
         house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), 
         house(red,english,snails,milk,winstons), 
         house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), 
         house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)]) = 1.0000
  ```  
- **Verification:** The result matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, where the Japanese person owns the zebra and the Norwegian drinks water.  
- **Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No failures detected.**  
- **Verified Predicates:**  
  - `my_member/2`: Correctly implements list membership.  
  - `next_to/3`: Correctly checks adjacency using `right_of/3`.  
  - `right_of/3`: Correctly verifies the relative position of elements in a list.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The constraints in the `zebra/1` predicate are logically sound and correctly encode the puzzle's rules.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The recursive predicates (`my_member/2`, `right_of/3`) terminate as they reduce the list size in each recursive call.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The puzzle does not use probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic computations (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are involved.  
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not use neural network integration (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`). **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic programming.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.  
- **Non-List Input:** The `houses/1` predicate ensures the input is a list of five houses.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is limited to the length of the list (5), so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to ProbLog's syntax and semantics. No issues were identified during testing. The solution is robust and handles all specified constraints accurately. For future enhancements, consider adding probabilistic facts or neural network integration to explore more complex scenarios.
