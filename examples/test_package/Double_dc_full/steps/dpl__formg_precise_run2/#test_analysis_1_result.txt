### Evaluation Report: Merge Sort in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Merge Sort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its adherence to the specified requirements, and ensure it handles edge cases and probabilistic scenarios appropriately.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(merge_sort([3,1,2,5,7,12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  merge_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Conclusion**:  
  The test passed successfully, producing the correct sorted list with a probability of 1.0000.  
  **All tests passed (no failures).**

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- No failures were detected in the provided test case.  
- **Verification of Expansion Predicates**:  
  The code does not use any expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, etc.), so this requirement is not applicable.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness**:  
  The implementation adheres to the merge sort algorithm's logic:  
  1. **Splitting**: The `split_list/3` predicate correctly divides the list into two halves.  
  2. **Recursion**: The recursive calls to `merge_sort/2` ensure the sublists are sorted.  
  3. **Merging**: The `merge/3` predicate combines the sorted sublists correctly.  
- **Recursive Termination**:  
  The base cases (`[]` and `[X]`) ensure termination for lists of length 0 or 1.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic analysis is required.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature**:  
  The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning**:  
  The implementation meets the requirements for classical reasoning, correctly sorting the input list.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**:  
  Not applicable, as the code does not use probabilistic features.  
- **Neural Network Integration**:  
  Not applicable, as the code does not use DeepProbLog features.

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Non-list Input**:  
  The code does not explicitly handle non-list inputs (e.g., atoms or numbers). This could lead to runtime errors.  
- **Performance**:  
  The recursive nature of merge sort may lead to performance issues for very large lists, but this is inherent to the algorithm.  
- **Undefined Predicates**:  
  No undefined predicates were detected in the provided code.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                     | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | Potential runtime errors   | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | DeepProbLog not used     | N/A                        | Consider extending for hybrid tasks. |

---

### **Final Remarks**  
The merge sort implementation in ProbLog is logically correct and passes the provided test case. However, it lacks handling for non-list inputs and does not utilize probabilistic or DeepProbLog features. Future improvements could include input validation and integration with probabilistic reasoning or neural networks for hybrid tasks.
