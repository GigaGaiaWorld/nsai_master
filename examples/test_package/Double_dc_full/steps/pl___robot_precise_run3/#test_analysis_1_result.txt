### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Robot Key-Carrying Scenario**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models a scenario where a robot navigates between locations while potentially carrying a key. The code includes probabilistic rules for actions like `goto`, `pickup`, and `drop`, as well as deterministic rules for tracking the positions of the robot and the key. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze its probabilistic reasoning, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were executed, and their results are as follows:  

- `carrying(key,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4331`  
- `at(robot,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.9000`  
- `at(robot,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0900`  
- `at(robot,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0100`  
- `at(key,loc2,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.5670`  
- `at(key,loc1,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.4330`  
- `at(key,loc0,s(s(s(0)))) = 0.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the model, given the probabilistic rules and initial conditions.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for `carrying/2`, `at/3`, and `drops/2` are logically sound. Recursive definitions (e.g., `slippery/2`) terminate correctly due to the base case `slippery(key,0)`.  
- **Negation as Failure:** The use of `\+` (negation as failure) is appropriate for modeling conditions like `\+ do(putdown(key),T)`.

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- **Probabilistic Facts:** The probabilities for `pickup_succeeds/1`, `drop_slippery_key/1`, and `fumbles_key/1` comply with the rule `P(¬A) = 1 − P(A)`. For example:  
  - `0.7::pickup_succeeds(T); 0.3::pickup_fails(T)` correctly sums to 1.  
- **Implications:** The probabilistic implications (e.g., `drops/2`) are correctly modeled using disjunctions.

##### **DeepProbLog Features**  
- **Verification:** No DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`) are used in the code.  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The deterministic rules for `at/3` and `carrying/2` correctly model the robot's and key's positions.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Fully met. The probabilistic facts and rules accurately reflect the uncertainty in actions like `pickup` and `goto`.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).  

##### **Edge Cases**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** No undefined predicates were detected.  
- **Non-List Input:** Not applicable, as the model does not handle lists.  
- **Deep Recursion:** The recursion depth is manageable (limited by the time steps `s(T)`).

|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** 450

**Final Remarks:**  
The ProbLog code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic and deterministic components are correctly implemented, and the test results validate the model's accuracy. No issues or edge cases were overlooked.
