  "HASH": "47D659C8",
  "ErrorSummary": "No issues found in the core sorting logic. The code correctly implements bubblesort and passes the test case. However, it lacks input validation for non-list inputs and has O(nÂ²) time complexity.",
  "SuggestedFix": "1. Add input validation to ensure the input is a list. 2. Consider optimizing for performance if large lists are expected (though this is not strictly necessary for correctness).",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "NeedRegenerate": false
