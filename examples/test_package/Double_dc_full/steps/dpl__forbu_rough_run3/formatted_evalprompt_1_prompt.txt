</Result>
</Code>

<Evaluation_Instructions>
 
1. **Test Results Verification**
- List all queries and their return values ​​(including probability results).
- If all tests pass, please clearly output "All tests passed (no failures)" and briefly explain why there are no failures.
- If there are failures, point out the failed queries one by one and give the corresponding actual vs. expected results.

2. **Failure Localization**
- For each failed test, point out the specific predicate or rule with the error and the corresponding code line number interval.
- If there is no failure, also verify that all expansion predicates (e.g., `implies/2`, `opposite/1`, `expand/2`, `includes/2`, `extend/3`, `refute/1`) are correctly defined in both classical and probabilistic contexts.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
- In classical Problog scenarios, analyze logical correctness and recursive termination.
- In ProbLog probabilistic scenarios, check whether the computation of probabilistic facts and negations/implications complies with probabilistic rules such as `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`, `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`.
- If there are DeepProbLog related calls (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`), verify whether the fusion of neural network output and probabilistic reasoning is correct; if it is not used at all, report "DeepProbLog feature not used".

4. **Overall Analysis**
- For the functional requirements (classical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, neural network integration), indicate whether they are met and briefly explain.
- Comment on the easily overlooked edge cases (undefined `expand/2`, non-list input, deep recursive performance, etc.).

5. **Report Format**
- Use Markdown and include the following parts:
1. **Document Title**
2. **Background and Purpose**
3. **Test Results Summary**
4. **Failure Localization**
5. **Root Cause Analysis**
6. **Overall Analysis**
7. **Error Summary** (tabular form: number | problem | impact | suggestion)
- Must include code blocks and tables, and the word count should be between 300–500 words.
- The tone should be formal and the logic should be clear.

### Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, which is a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the functional requirements (classical and probabilistic reasoning). The test case provided checks the sorting of the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes, as the output `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` matches the expected sorted list. The probability of `1.0000` indicates deterministic correctness.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**:  
  Since the test passes, there are no failures to localize. The predicates `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/4` are correctly implemented, and the recursive termination is ensured by the base case `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The algorithm is logically correct, as it correctly sorts the input list.  
  - Recursive termination is guaranteed because the list is reduced in each recursive call until it becomes empty.  
- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`). It is purely deterministic.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...`, or similar calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements the bubblesort logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.  

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | May cause runtime errors       | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Performance for large n  | Inefficient for large lists    | Consider optimizing or using a more efficient algorithm. |

---

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The `bubblesort/3` implementation is correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks probabilistic features and edge-case handling. Improvements could include input validation and performance optimization for larger datasets.

<Evaluation_Instructions>
For each <langda> code module (identified by its HASH):
1.Summarize the errors in that module in a brief *ErrorSummary*. If no errors, state "No issues found."
2.Propose a *SuggestedFix* that specifically addresses the error(s) (e.g. add a missing predicate, correct a probability rule). Include line numbers or module names if helpful.
3.List any *Dependencies* (by HASH) on other modules that must be modified together with this one (if none, use an empty list).
4.Set *NeedRegenerate* to true if the module requires changes (errors present), or false if it’s correct.
</Evaluation_Instructions>
<Final_Answer> 
Provide a JSON object for each code module with the keys "HASH", "ErrorSummary", "SuggestedFix", "Dependencies", "NeedRegenerate". Format the output as a JSON array or separate JSON blocks. For example:
// Inside the ```report ... ``` blocks, make sure not to use the ``` symbol to prevent parsing errors
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX1234","ErrorSummary": "Missing base case in factorial predicate causing infinite recursion","SuggestedFix": "Add a base case predicate for factorial(0) = 1 to handle termination","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": true}
```
```report
{"HASH": "XXXX5678","ErrorSummary": "No issues found","SuggestedFix": "None needed","Dependencies": [],"NeedRegenerate": false}
```
