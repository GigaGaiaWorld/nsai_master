### Evaluation Report: Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Bubblesort Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements a `bubblesort/3` algorithm in ProbLog, which is a probabilistic extension of Prolog. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic reasoning rules, and ensure it meets the functional requirements (classical and probabilistic reasoning). The test case provided checks the sorting of the list `[3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]`.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  forth_sort([3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12], [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The test passes, as the output `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12]` matches the expected sorted list. The probability of `1.0000` indicates deterministic correctness.  
  **Conclusion**: All tests passed (no failures).

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **No Failures**:  
  Since the test passes, there are no failures to localize. The predicates `bubblesort/3` and `bubble/4` are correctly implemented, and the recursive termination is ensured by the base case `bubblesort([], Acc, Acc)`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The algorithm is logically correct, as it correctly sorts the input list.  
  - Recursive termination is guaranteed because the list is reduced in each recursive call until it becomes empty.  
- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The code does not use probabilistic facts or rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` or `P(A⇒B)=P(¬A)+P(A∧B)`). It is purely deterministic.  
  - **DeepProbLog Feature**: Not used (no `nn/3`, `tensor/...`, or similar calls).  

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Fully met. The algorithm correctly implements the bubblesort logic.  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Non-list Input**: The code assumes the input is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.  
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which may be inefficient for large lists.  
  - **Undefined Predicates**: No undefined predicates (`expand/2`, etc.) are used.

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| Number | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Non-list input handling  | May cause runtime errors       | Add input validation for lists.     |
| 2      | Performance for large n  | Inefficient for large lists    | Consider optimizing or using a more efficient algorithm. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Remarks**:  
The `bubblesort/3` implementation is correct for the given test case and meets classical reasoning requirements. However, it lacks probabilistic features and edge-case handling. Improvements could include input validation and performance optimization for larger datasets.
