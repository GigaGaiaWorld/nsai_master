### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller, inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of flaps under probabilistic conditions (actuator selection, wind effects) and checks for goal achievement or overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the code, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and logical rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results for the queries `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` (for `T = 1..5`) are as follows:

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000             |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030             |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110             |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127             |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114             |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The probabilities align with the expected behavior of the system, where the likelihood of reaching the goal decreases over time, and overrun exceptions remain minimal.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. The predicates and rules are correctly implemented, including:
- `goal_reached/1` and `overrun_exception/1` (lines 10–15).
- `attempted_flap_position/2` (lines 16–22).
- Probabilistic facts for `wind/1` and `wind_effect/2` (lines 6–9).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Logical Correctness:**  
  - The recursive termination condition (`\+ goal_reached(Prev)`) ensures no unnecessary calculations once the goal is reached.
  - The direction of actuator thrust (`AE = sign(GP - Old) * AS`) is correctly computed.
  
- **Probabilistic Rules:**  
  - The probabilities for `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with ProbLog's rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - No negations or implications violate probabilistic semantics.

- **DeepProbLog Integration:**  
  - **DeepProbLog feature not used.** The code does not employ neural network calls (e.g., `nn/3` or `tensor/...`).

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Met. The deterministic rules (e.g., `legal_flap_position/1`) are correctly defined.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Met. The probabilistic facts and their interactions are valid.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not applicable.

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not used in the code.
  - **Non-list Input:** Not applicable.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps (`at(5)`), avoiding performance issues.
