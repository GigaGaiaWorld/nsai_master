### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of Stack Operations in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`). The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of these operations, analyze their logical and probabilistic behavior, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The following queries were tested, and their results are as follows:

| Query | Result | Probability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]` | 1.0000 |
| `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)` | `Y = [2, 3, 1, 4]` | 1.0000 |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of each stack operation.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the test results. All predicates and rules function as intended. The following predicates were verified:
- `stack_op/3` (lines 1–7)
- `get_top_n/4` (lines 8–9)
- `insertion_sort/2` and `insert/3` (lines 10–18)

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**
- **Logical Correctness:** The predicates are logically sound. For example, `stack_op(pop, [X|Stack], Stack)` correctly removes the top element.
- **Recursive Termination:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate ensures termination by reducing the list size in each recursive call.

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**
- The code does not use probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) are applicable here.
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. All stack operations behave as expected.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Non-list Input:** The code assumes the stack is a list. Non-list inputs would cause errors.
- **Deep Recursion:** The `insertion_sort/2` predicate may face performance issues with large lists due to its recursive nature.
- **Undefined Cases:** The `sort` operation assumes the stack has at least 3 elements. For smaller stacks, `get_top_n/4` may fail.

---

#### **7. Error Summary**  

| No. | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| 1   | Non-list input for stack | Runtime error | Add input validation. |
| 2   | `sort` with fewer than 3 elements | Failure | Handle smaller stacks gracefully. |
| 3   | Deep recursion in `insertion_sort/2` | Performance bottleneck | Optimize or use a more efficient sorting algorithm. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words  

**Final Verdict:** The code meets the specified requirements for classical stack operations. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used. Edge cases should be addressed for robustness.
