### Code Evaluation Report: Stack Operations in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Stack Operations Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code implements a series of stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, `rot`, and `sort`) in ProbLog. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the implementation through test results.
- Analyze failures and root causes.
- Ensure compliance with classical and probabilistic reasoning rules.
- Check for edge cases and potential improvements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the provided queries are as follows:
- `stack_op(push(1), [2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000 (Failure)
- `stack_op(pop, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000 (Failure)
- `stack_op(dup, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000 (Failure)
- `stack_op(swap, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000 (Failure)
- `stack_op(over, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000 (Failure)
- `stack_op(rot, [1, 2, 3, 4], Y)`: Probability = 0.0000 (Failure)

**Conclusion**: All tests failed, as the probability results for all queries are `0.0000`.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
The failures indicate that the predicates for `push`, `pop`, `dup`, `swap`, `over`, and `rot` are either:
- Not implemented in the provided code.
- Incorrectly defined.

**Specific Issues**:
- The code only implements the `sort` operation (`stack_op(sort, Stack, SortedStack)`).
- The predicates for other operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are missing or not defined.

**Code Line Number**: The issue spans the entire code block, as the required predicates are absent.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
**Classical ProbLog Scenario**:
- The `sort` operation is correctly implemented, but the other operations are missing.
- The recursive termination for `sort` is correct, but the lack of other operations causes the failures.

**Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario**:
- No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the provided code.
- The failures are due to missing classical predicates, not probabilistic issues.

**DeepProbLog**:
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
**Functional Requirements**:
- **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (only `sort` is implemented).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts/rules).
- **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.

**Edge Cases**:
- Non-list inputs are not handled.
- Deep recursive performance is not tested (only `sort` is implemented).
- Missing operations (`push`, `pop`, etc.) are a significant oversight.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing `push` operation         | All `push` queries fail          | Implement `push` predicate          |
| 2      | Missing `pop` operation          | All `pop` queries fail           | Implement `pop` predicate           |
| 3      | Missing `dup` operation          | All `dup` queries fail           | Implement `dup` predicate           |
| 4      | Missing `swap` operation         | All `swap` queries fail          | Implement `swap` predicate          |
| 5      | Missing `over` operation         | All `over` queries fail          | Implement `over` predicate          |
| 6      | Missing `rot` operation          | All `rot` queries fail           | Implement `rot` predicate           |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Final Note**: The code requires significant revisions to implement the missing stack operations. The current implementation only supports the `sort` operation, leading to universal test failures for other queries.
