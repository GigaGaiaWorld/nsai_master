### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Calculation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, ...]`). The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `parse/2` to transform these images into symbols and compute the result. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze potential failures, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
- **Query Tested**:  
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result**:  
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X2) = 0.0000
  ```
- **Verification**:  
  The expected result for the expression `2 / (3 + 3) - 2 * 7` is `-13.6667`. The actual result (`0.0000`) is incorrect.  
  **Conclusion**: The test failed.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
- **Failed Query**:  
  The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returned an incorrect result.  
- **Problematic Predicate**:  
  The `parse/2` predicate is incomplete. Only the case for addition (`+`) is defined, while the cases for subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) are missing.  
- **Code Line**:  
  The issue lies in the missing rules for `parse/2` (e.g., `parse([N1, - | T], R)`, `parse([N1, * | T], R)`, `parse([N1, / | T], R)`).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - The recursive termination condition (`parse([N], R)`) is correct.  
  - The logical correctness is compromised due to incomplete parsing rules for all operators.  
- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario**:  
  - No probabilistic facts or negations are used in this code.  
  - The `almost_equal/2` predicate is correctly implemented for floating-point comparisons.  
- **DeepProbLog Integration**:  
  - The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/...`).  
  - **Report**: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  
- **Functional Requirements**:  
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met (missing operator cases).  
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).  
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.  
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested.  
  - Division by zero is not checked.

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Missing operator cases in `parse/2` | Incorrect calculation results   | Add rules for `-`, `*`, `/` in `parse/2`.  |
| 2      | No handling of division by zero   | Potential runtime errors        | Add a check for division by zero.          |
| 3      | Non-list input not handled       | Unpredictable behavior          | Validate input type in `expression/2`.     |

**Word Count**: ~450 words.  
**Tone**: Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion**: The code requires fixes for operator handling and edge cases to meet functional requirements.
