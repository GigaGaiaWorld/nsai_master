### Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code solves a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The puzzle adheres to the following constraints:  
1. Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9).  
2. The first digit of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.  
3. The addition must account for carry-over operations.  

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's probabilistic and classical reasoning rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results provided include 10 unique solutions for the query `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`. All solutions returned a probability of `1.0000`, indicating deterministic success.  

**Key Observations:**  
- All tests passed (no failures).  
- The results satisfy the constraints:  
  - `A`, `B`, and `C` are non-zero (leftdigit/1).  
  - All digits in `[A,B,C,D,E]` are unique (all_different/1).  
  - The arithmetic operations (`sumdigit/5`) correctly handle carry-over.  

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
Since all tests passed, no failures were detected. The following predicates were verified:  
- `digit/1`: Correctly defines digits 0-9.  
- `leftdigit/1`: Ensures non-zero first digits.  
- `all_different/1`: Enforces uniqueness of digits.  
- `sumdigit/5`: Correctly simulates column addition with carry-over.

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The rules for digit constraints, uniqueness, and addition are logically sound.  
- **Recursive Termination:** The `all_different/1` predicate terminates as it recursively checks each element against the remaining list.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The problem is deterministic (no probabilistic facts or rules), so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are not applicable.  
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/…`) were used. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
| Requirement          | Status      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classical Reasoning  | Met         | Constraints and arithmetic are correctly implemented.                       |
| Probabilistic Reasoning | Not Applicable | No probabilistic facts or rules were used.                                |
| Neural Network Integration | Not Used | No DeepProbLog features were employed.                                   |

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Inputs:** The code assumes valid digit inputs. Non-digit inputs would fail.  
- **Performance:** The `all_different/1` predicate may become inefficient for larger lists due to its recursive nature.

**Conclusion:**  
The cryptoaddition puzzle is correctly implemented in ProbLog, adhering to all specified constraints. The test results confirm the absence of failures, and the code is logically sound. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features were required or used. Future work could include extending the puzzle to handle probabilistic inputs or larger digit sets.
