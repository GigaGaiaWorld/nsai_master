### Evaluation Report: Cryptoaddition Puzzle in ProbLog

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Cryptoaddition Puzzle: AB + BCD = CDE in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to solve a cryptoaddition puzzle where `AB + BCD = CDE`. The puzzle requires:
1. Defining digits (0-9) and ensuring the first digit of multi-digit numbers is not 0.
2. Ensuring all letters represent unique digits.
3. Performing column-wise addition with carry propagation.

The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze test results, and ensure compliance with ProbLog's logical and probabilistic rules.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Executed**: `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`.
- **Result**: `query_sum([X6, X7, X8, X9, X10]) = 0.0000`.

**Interpretation**:
- The result `0.0000` indicates that the query returned no valid solutions. This suggests a failure in the logic or constraints of the puzzle.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query**: `query_sum([A,B,C,D,E])`.
- **Expected Result**: At least one valid assignment of digits to `[A,B,C,D,E]` satisfying `AB + BCD = CDE`.
- **Actual Result**: No valid assignments found (`0.0000` probability).

**Specific Issues**:
1. **Constraint Violation**: The `all_different/1` predicate may be too restrictive or incorrectly implemented.
2. **Carry Propagation**: The `sumdigit/5` predicate might not correctly handle carry propagation for all cases.
3. **First Digit Rule**: The `leftdigit/1` predicate could be excluding valid solutions.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog**:
  - **Logical Correctness**: The recursive `all_different/1` predicate is correctly implemented, but the constraints may be overly restrictive.
  - **Termination**: The recursion in `all_different/1` terminates correctly for finite lists.
- **Probabilistic Context**:
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in this code, so probabilistic rules like `P(¬A)=1−P(A)` are irrelevant here.
- **DeepProbLog**: Not used in this code. Report: "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Partially met. The puzzle logic is implemented, but the constraints may be too strict.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not used.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined Inputs**: Non-list inputs to `all_different/1` are not handled.
  - **Performance**: Deep recursion in `all_different/1` could be inefficient for larger lists.

|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | No valid solutions found         | Puzzle unsolved                | Relax constraints or debug `sumdigit/5`.   |
| 2      | Overly restrictive constraints   | Excludes valid solutions       | Review `all_different/1` and `leftdigit/1`. |
| 3      | No probabilistic reasoning       | Limited scope                  | Add probabilistic facts if needed.         |
| 4      | Deep recursion risk              | Performance issue for large N  | Optimize `all_different/1` for efficiency. |

**Word Count**: ~400 words.  

**Conclusion**: The code fails to solve the cryptoaddition puzzle due to overly restrictive constraints or incorrect carry handling. Recommendations include debugging the `sumdigit/5` predicate and relaxing constraints in `all_different/1`. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
