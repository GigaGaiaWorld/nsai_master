### Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of ProbLog Code for Expression Parsing and Evaluation**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code aims to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as lists of symbols (numbers and operators). The `parse/2` predicate is designed to handle operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division recursively. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify failures, and analyze the root causes of any issues.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:** The test failed with the error:
  ```
  UnknownClause: No clauses found for ''->'/2' at 36:13.
  ```
- **Interpretation:** The error indicates that the `parse/2` predicate is not correctly defined or is missing clauses for certain cases.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query involving a complex arithmetic expression failed.
- **Error Location:** The error points to line 36, column 13, suggesting an issue with the `parse/2` predicate.
- **Specific Issue:** The `parse/2` predicate is not handling the recursive case correctly, leading to an unknown clause error.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The `parse/2` predicate is intended to handle arithmetic operations recursively. However, the error suggests that the predicate is not fully defined for all possible input cases.
- **Recursive Termination:** The base case (`parse([N], R)`) is correctly defined, but the recursive cases (`parse([N1, Op, N2 | Rest], R)`) may not cover all edge cases (e.g., empty lists or invalid operators).
- **Probabilistic Context:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or DeepProbLog features, so this aspect is not applicable here.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The `parse/2` predicate works for simple cases but fails for complex expressions.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts or rules).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used ("DeepProbLog feature not used").
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined cases for invalid operators or malformed lists.
  - Non-list inputs are not handled.
  - Deep recursion performance is not tested but could be a concern for very long expressions.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| No. | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Missing clauses in `parse/2`     | Fails for complex expressions   | Ensure all operator cases are covered.     |
| 2   | No error handling for invalid inputs | Crashes for malformed lists | Add input validation.                      |
| 3   | Deep recursion not tested        | Potential performance issues    | Test with long expressions.                |

---

#### **8. Code Corrections**
To fix the issue, ensure the `parse/2` predicate is fully defined for all operator cases and handles edge conditions. For example:
```prolog
parse([N], R) :- almost_equal(N, R).
parse([N1, Op, N2 | Rest], R) :-
    (Op = * ; Op = / ; Op = + ; Op = -),
    almost_equal(N1, V1),
    almost_equal(N2, V2),
    (Op = * -> Temp is V1 * V2 ;
     Op = / -> Temp is V1 / V2 ;
     Op = + -> Temp is V1 + V2 ;
     Op = - -> Temp is V1 - V2),
    parse([Temp | Rest], R).
```

#### **9. Conclusion**
The code partially meets the requirements but fails for complex expressions due to incomplete predicate definitions. Addressing the missing clauses and edge cases will ensure robustness. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used.
