### **Evaluation Report: ProbLog Code Analysis**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Arithmetic Expression Parsing**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code is designed to parse arithmetic expressions represented as lists of images (e.g., `[image_2, image_divide, image_3, ...]`) into their evaluated results. The code uses predicates like `detect_number/2`, `detect_operator/2`, and `parse/2` to achieve this. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
- **Query Tested:**
  ```prolog
  query(expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)).
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```prolog
  expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], 11.666666666666668) = 1.0000
  ```
- **Verification:**
  - The query evaluates the expression `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7`, which simplifies to `0.666... + 3 - 14 = -10.333...`. However, the result `11.666...` is incorrect.
  - **Conclusion:** The test fails due to an incorrect evaluation of the arithmetic expression.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The query `expression([image_2, image_divide, image_3, image_plus, image_3, image_minus, image_2, image_multiply, image_7], X)` returns an incorrect result.
- **Expected Result:** `-10.333...`
- **Actual Result:** `11.666...`
- **Faulty Predicate:** The `parse/2` predicate does not correctly handle operator precedence (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).
- **Code Location:** The issue lies in the `parse/2` rules (lines 1â€“16 in the `<Code_Block>` section).

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:**
  - The `parse/2` rules process operations left-to-right without considering operator precedence. For example, `2 / 3 + 3 - 2 * 7` is evaluated as `((2 / 3) + 3) - (2 * 7)`, which is incorrect.
  - **Recursive Termination:** The recursion terminates correctly, but the logic is flawed.
- **Probabilistic Scenarios:**
  - The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules are violated.
- **DeepProbLog:** No neural network calls (`nn/3`, `tensor/...`) are used. **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met. The code parses expressions but fails to respect operator precedence.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable (no probabilistic facts).
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **Undefined Inputs:** Non-list inputs or invalid symbols are not handled.
  - **Deep Recursion:** No performance issues observed, but the logic is incorrect.
  - **Operator Precedence:** Overlooked, leading to incorrect evaluations.

| No. | Problem                  | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Incorrect operator precedence | Wrong arithmetic results       | Rewrite `parse/2` to handle precedence (e.g., using a grammar-based approach). |
| 2   | No edge case handling    | Crashes on invalid inputs      | Add input validation (e.g., `check_list/1`). |
| 3   | No probabilistic facts   | Limited to classical reasoning | Extend with probabilistic rules if needed. |

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  
**Tone:** Formal and analytical.  
**Conclusion:** The code fails due to incorrect operator precedence. Rewriting the `parse/2` predicate to respect precedence and adding input validation are recommended.
