### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Population Density Query**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided ProbLog code aims to query a database of countries' populations and areas to identify pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities. The query uses integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point division, ensuring robustness. The evaluation verifies the correctness of the implementation, including logical consistency, probabilistic reasoning (if any), and adherence to requirements.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results are as follows:  
- `query_pop([china, 244, france, 246]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([indonesia, 223, pakistan, 219]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([pakistan, 219, indonesia, 223]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([mexico, 76, ethiopia, 77]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([italy, 477, philippines, 461]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([france, 246, china, 244]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([philippines, 461, italy, 477]) = 1.0000`  
- `query_pop([ethiopia, 77, mexico, 76]) = 1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior, as the inequalities `20×D1 < 21×D2` and `20×D2 < 21×D1` correctly approximate the condition `D1/D2 ≈ 1.05`.

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected. The predicates `query_pop/1` and `density/2` are correctly implemented, and the expansion predicates (e.g., `pop/2`, `area/2`) are accurately defined.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

**Classical ProbLog Scenarios:**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the `query_pop/1` predicate ensures that pairs of countries with approximately equal densities are identified. The inequalities avoid division, ensuring integer arithmetic correctness.  
- **Recursive Termination:** No recursion is used in this implementation, so termination is not a concern.  

**Probabilistic Scenarios:**  
- The code does not involve probabilistic facts or rules, so no probabilistic reasoning (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`) is required.  

**DeepProbLog Integration:**  
- The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/…`).  
  **Report:** "DeepProbLog feature not used."

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The query correctly identifies pairs of countries with approximately equal population densities.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

**Edge Cases:**  
- **Undefined Predicates:** All predicates (`pop/2`, `area/2`, `density/2`, `query_pop/1`) are defined.  
- **Non-list Input:** The input format is enforced by the query structure, so invalid inputs are unlikely.  
- **Performance:** The implementation is efficient, with no deep recursion or performance bottlenecks.
