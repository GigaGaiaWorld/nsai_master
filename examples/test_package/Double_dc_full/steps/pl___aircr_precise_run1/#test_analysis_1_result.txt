### **Evaluation Report: Aircraft Flap Controller in ProbLog**

---

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of ProbLog Code for Aircraft Flap Controller**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided ProbLog code models an aircraft flap controller system inspired by Filieri et al.'s work. The system simulates the movement of a flap from an initial position to a goal position, considering actuator strength, wind effects, and potential overrun exceptions. The purpose of this evaluation is to:
- Verify the correctness of the code against the given requirements.
- Analyze the probabilistic reasoning and classical logic.
- Ensure compliance with ProbLog's rules and edge cases.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results for the queries `goal_reached(T)` and `overrun_exception(T)` (for `T = 1` to `5`) are as follows:

| Query               | Probability Result |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `goal_reached(1)`   | 0.2625             |
| `goal_reached(2)`   | 0.1873             |
| `goal_reached(3)`   | 0.1269             |
| `goal_reached(4)`   | 0.0841             |
| `goal_reached(5)`   | 0.0570             |
| `overrun_exception(1)` | 0.0000          |
| `overrun_exception(2)` | 0.0030          |
| `overrun_exception(3)` | 0.0110          |
| `overrun_exception(4)` | 0.0127          |
| `overrun_exception(5)` | 0.0114          |

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The results align with the expected behavior of the system, where the probability of reaching the goal decreases over time, and the likelihood of overrun exceptions increases slightly.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
No failures were detected in the test results. The following predicates and rules were verified:
- **`goal_reached/1`**: Correctly checks if the flap position matches the goal.
- **`overrun_exception/1`**: Correctly identifies illegal flap positions.
- **`attempted_flap_position/2`**: Accurately calculates the new position based on actuator strength, wind effect, and goal direction.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**:
  - The recursive logic in `attempted_flap_position/2` terminates correctly when the goal is reached or an overrun occurs.
  - The use of `\+ goal_reached(Prev)` ensures no unnecessary calculations are performed once the goal is achieved.
- **Probabilistic Scenarios**:
  - The probabilities of `wind_effect/2` and `use_actuator/2` comply with ProbLog rules (e.g., `P(¬A) = 1−P(A)`).
  - The negation in `\+ legal_flap_position(Pos)` is correctly handled.
- **DeepProbLog Features**: Not used in this code.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - **Classical Reasoning**: Met. The logic for flap movement and goal checking is sound.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Met. The probabilities for actuator selection and wind effects are correctly implemented.
  - **Neural Network Integration**: Not applicable (DeepProbLog not used).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Undefined `expand/2`**: Not used in this code.
  - **Non-list Input**: Not applicable.
  - **Deep Recursive Performance**: The recursion depth is limited to 5 steps, so performance is not an issue.

#### **7. Error Summary**
| Number | Problem | Impact | Suggestion |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1      | None    | None   | None       |

**Word Count:** ~400 words.

**Final Remarks:** The code is well-structured and meets all specified requirements. The probabilistic and classical reasoning components are correctly implemented, and no edge cases were overlooked. No suggestions for improvement are necessary at this time.
