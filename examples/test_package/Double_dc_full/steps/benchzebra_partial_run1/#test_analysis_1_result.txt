### ProbLog Code Evaluation Report

---

#### **1. Document Title**  
**Evaluation of the Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**  
The provided code implements the classic "Zebra Puzzle" in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the attributes of five houses based on a set of given clues. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, analyze its logical and probabilistic soundness, and ensure compliance with the specified requirements.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**  
The test results indicate the following:  
- **Query:** `zebra([house(yellow,norwegian,fox,water,kools), house(blue,ukrainian,horse,tea,chesterfields), house(red,english,snail,milk,winstons), house(ivory,spanish,dog,orange_juice,lucky_strikes), house(green,japanese,zebra,coffee,parliaments)])`  
- **Probability:** `1.0000`  

**Conclusion:** All tests passed (no failures). The output matches the expected solution to the Zebra Puzzle, satisfying all given requirements.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**  
No failures were detected in the implementation. All predicates and rules are correctly defined, and the output aligns with the puzzle's constraints.  

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**  

##### **Classical ProbLog Scenarios**  
- **Logical Correctness:** The code correctly implements the puzzle's constraints using predicates like `my_member`, `right_of`, and `next_to`. Recursive termination is ensured by the base cases in these predicates.  
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as non-list inputs implicitly by the nature of Prolog's pattern matching.  

##### **Probabilistic Scenarios**  
- The puzzle does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so no probabilistic rules (e.g., `P(¬A)=1−P(A)`) are applicable.  
- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

#### **6. Overall Analysis**  

##### **Functional Requirements**  
- **Classical Reasoning:** Fully met. The puzzle is solved using deterministic logic.  
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.  
- **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.  

##### **Edge Cases and Performance**  
- **Undefined `expand/2`:** Not applicable.  
- **Non-list Input:** Handled by Prolog's pattern matching.  
- **Deep Recursive Performance:** The recursion depth is fixed (5 houses), so performance is not an issue.

**Word Count:** ~350 words  

**Final Remarks:**  
The implementation is correct and adheres to the puzzle's requirements. No issues were identified during the evaluation. The code is concise, logically sound, and performs as expected.
