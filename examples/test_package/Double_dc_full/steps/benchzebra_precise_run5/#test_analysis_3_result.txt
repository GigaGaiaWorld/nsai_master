### **Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog**

#### **1. Document Title**
**Evaluation of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The Zebra Puzzle is a classic logic puzzle where the goal is to determine the correct arrangement of houses and their attributes based on given constraints. This evaluation analyzes a ProbLog implementation of the puzzle, focusing on:
- Correctness of the logical constraints.
- Proper use of ProbLog predicates.
- Handling of recursive and list operations.
- Verification of test results and error localization.

---

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The provided code fails during execution with the following error:
```plaintext
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Key Observations:**
- The error indicates that the predicate `member/2` is undefined in the ProbLog context.
- No other test results are available due to this critical failure.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Query:** The entire `zebra/1` predicate fails because `member/2` is not defined.
- **Code Location:** The error occurs at line 4, where `member/2` is first used.
- **Root Cause:** The predicate `member/2` is a built-in in Prolog but not in ProbLog unless explicitly defined or imported.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Classical ProbLog Scenario:**
  - The code assumes the availability of `member/2` as a built-in predicate, which is incorrect for ProbLog.
  - The recursive predicates `right_of/3` and `next_to/3` are correctly defined but unused due to the `member/2` failure.
  - The `houses/1` predicate is correctly defined but not utilized effectively.

- **Probabilistic ProbLog Scenario:**
  - No probabilistic facts or rules are used in the code, so probabilistic reasoning is not applicable here.
  - The error is purely syntactic and related to predicate availability.

- **DeepProbLog Feature:** Not used in this implementation.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** Partially met (logical constraints are correctly specified but not executable due to `member/2`).
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Undefined predicates (`member/2`) are a critical oversight.
  - Non-list inputs or malformed house structures are not handled.
  - Recursive performance is not tested due to the early failure.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Entire program fails to execute | Define `member/2` or use a ProbLog-compatible alternative. |
| 2      | No probabilistic reasoning       | Limited to classical logic     | Add probabilistic facts if required.       |
| 3      | No DeepProbLog features          | Not applicable                 | Consider neural integration if needed.     |

---

#### **8. Recommendations**
1. **Define `member/2`:**
   ```prolog
   member(X, [X|_]).
   member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).
   ```
2. **Test Incrementally:** Verify each constraint separately before combining them.
3. **Add Probabilistic Elements:** If the puzzle requires probabilistic reasoning, include probabilistic facts or rules.

---

**Word Count:** ~450 words.  

**Final Note:** The implementation is logically sound but fails due to a missing predicate definition. Addressing this issue will enable successful execution.
