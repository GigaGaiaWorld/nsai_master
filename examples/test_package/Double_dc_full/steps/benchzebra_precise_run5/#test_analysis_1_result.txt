### Evaluation Report: Zebra Puzzle in ProbLog

#### **1. Document Title**
**Analysis of Zebra Puzzle Implementation in ProbLog**

---

#### **2. Background and Purpose**
The provided code attempts to solve the classic "Zebra Puzzle" using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language. The puzzle involves deducing the correct arrangement of houses based on a set of given constraints. The purpose of this evaluation is to verify the correctness of the implementation, identify any failures, and analyze the root causes of these failures.

#### **3. Test Results Summary**
The test results indicate a failure during execution. The error message is as follows:
```
Error evaluating Problog model:
    return exec_func(node_id=node_id, node=node, **kwdargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/zhenzhili/miniforge3/envs/langda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/problog/engine_stack.py", line 839, in eval_call
    raise UnknownClause(origin, location=loc)
problog.engine.UnknownClause: No clauses found for 'member/2' at 4:1.
```

**Failed Queries:**
- The query `member/2` failed because the predicate `member/2` is not defined in the provided code. The error occurs at line 4.

---

#### **4. Failure Localization**
- **Failed Predicate:** `member/2`
- **Code Line:** 4
- **Issue:** The predicate `member/2` is used in the code but is not defined. The error message explicitly states that no clauses were found for `member/2`.

---

#### **5. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Logical Correctness:** The logic of the puzzle constraints is correctly implemented, but the absence of the `member/2` predicate prevents the code from executing.
- **Recursive Termination:** Not applicable here, as the failure is due to a missing predicate rather than recursion issues.
- **Probabilistic Rules:** The code does not involve probabilistic facts or negations, so this aspect is not relevant for this analysis.
- **DeepProbLog Features:** The code does not use any DeepProbLog features (e.g., `nn/3`, `tensor/â€¦`), so this is not a factor in the failure.

---

#### **6. Overall Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - **Classical Reasoning:** The constraints of the puzzle are correctly specified, but the missing `member/2` predicate prevents the code from functioning.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Not applicable in this context.
  - **Neural Network Integration:** Not used.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The undefined `member/2` predicate is a critical oversight.
  - The code assumes the existence of certain predicates (`right_of/3`, `next_to/3`) without verifying their definitions, though these are correctly defined in the provided code.

#### **7. Error Summary**

| Number | Problem                          | Impact                          | Suggestion                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Undefined `member/2` predicate   | Code execution fails          | Define the `member/2` predicate or replace it with a built-in equivalent. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The primary issue in the provided code is the missing `member/2` predicate, which prevents the code from executing. Once this predicate is defined or replaced, the code should function correctly, as the remaining logic and constraints are properly implemented. No probabilistic or DeepProbLog features are used in this implementation.
