  "final_report": "The generated code is not valid due to a syntax error. The predicate 'member' is used instead of 'my_member', which causes the Problog engine to fail with an 'UnknownClause' error. The original code correctly uses 'my_member' throughout. The generated code is inconsistent with the original in this critical aspect, leading to a failure in execution. Additionally, there is a minor inconsistency in the generated code where 'snail' is used instead of 'snails' as in the original."
