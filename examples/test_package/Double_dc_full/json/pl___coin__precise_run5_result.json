  "final_report": "The generated code is syntactically correct and meets the requirements, but it produces different results compared to the original code. The original code counts the number of successful coin flips out of 4 attempts, with each flip having a 0.8 probability of success. The generated code, however, accumulates probabilities differently, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the generated code's results sum to values greater than 1, which is not possible for a probability distribution."
