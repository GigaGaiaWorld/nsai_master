  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining the same probabilistic outcomes as the original code. It simplifies the door opening rules into a single clause while ensuring the same behavior: the host opens a non-prize, non-selected door with equal probability when multiple choices exist. Both codes produce identical results for prize distribution, door selection, and win probabilities (keep vs. switch), confirming functional equivalence."
