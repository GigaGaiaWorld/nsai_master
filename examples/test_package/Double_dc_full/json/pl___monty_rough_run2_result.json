  "final_report": "The generated code correctly implements the Monty Hall problem logic, maintaining the same probabilistic behavior as the original code. It simplifies the door-opening rules into a single clause using findall to handle the cases where Monty can choose between two non-prize, non-selected doors with equal probability. The results match the original exactly, showing 1/3 chance of winning by keeping the choice and 2/3 by switching."
