  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality. It maintains the same logic for determining the outcome of rock-paper-scissors games and computing the final winner. The only difference is the renaming of the 'result' predicate to 'outcome' in the generated code, which does not affect the behavior. Both codes produce the same result for the given query."
