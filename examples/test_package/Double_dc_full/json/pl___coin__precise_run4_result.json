  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. The original code uses a single recursive clause with a disjunction to handle both coin success and failure cases, while the generated code separates these into two distinct recursive clauses. This structural difference does not affect the logic or outcomes, as evidenced by the identical run results. Both codes correctly model the probabilistic scenario of flipping four coins with an 80% success rate and produce the same probability distribution for the total number of successful flips."
