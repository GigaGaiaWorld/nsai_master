  "final_report": "The generated code is functionally identical to the original code, with only minor formatting differences such as line breaks and spacing. The logic and structure of the merge sort implementation remain unchanged, including the base cases, splitting, merging, and append operations. The running results of both codes are consistent, producing the correct sorted list [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12] for the input [3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12]. No functional or logical issues were found in the generated code."
