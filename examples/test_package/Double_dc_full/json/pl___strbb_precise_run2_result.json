  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of logic and structure. However, there is a subtle difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'pick(I + 1, b)' instead of the original's 'II is I + 1, pick(II, b)'. This change does not affect the logical correctness but might impact the readability. The main issue is that the running results differ significantly (0.3750 vs 0.6484), indicating a potential problem in the probabilistic calculations or the interpretation of the rules."
