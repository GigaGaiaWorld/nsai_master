  "final_report": "The generated code is incomplete and does not meet the requirements. It only includes one constraint (the English person in the red house) and lacks all other constraints present in the original code. As a result, the generated code produces multiple possible solutions with many unbound variables, which is inconsistent with the original code's single, fully-bound solution. The generated code is not valid as it fails to implement the full logic of the original puzzle."
