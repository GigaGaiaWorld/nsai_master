  "final_report": "The generated code is correct and consistent with the original code in terms of functionality and results. It simplifies some conditions in the 'open_door' rules by explicitly stating the constraints (A \\= Selected, B \\= Selected, A \\= B) instead of using inequalities and negations. This makes the code clearer while maintaining the same logical flow. Both codes produce identical results, confirming the correctness of the generated code."
