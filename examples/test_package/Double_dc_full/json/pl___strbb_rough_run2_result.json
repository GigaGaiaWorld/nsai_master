  "final_report": "The generated code is mostly consistent with the original code in terms of structure and logic. However, there is a significant difference in the 'bb' predicate where the generated code uses 'N > 1' and 'pick(I + 1, b)' instead of the original 'Max is N-1' and 'II is I+1, pick(II,b)'. This change affects the probability calculation, leading to a different result (0.6484 vs 0.3750). The generated code is valid in form but produces inconsistent results due to this modification."
